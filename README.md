| **[A Lower Bound for the Max Entropy Algorithm for TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01950v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most famous conjectures in combinatorial optimization is the four-thirds conjecture, which states that the integrality gap of the subtour LP relaxation of the TSP is equal to $\frac43$. For 40 years, the best known upper bound was 1.5, due to Wolsey (1980). Recently, Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan (2022) showed that the max entropy algorithm for the TSP gives an improved bound of $1.5 - 10^{-36}$. In this paper, we show that the approximation ratio of the max entropy algorithm is at least 1.375, even for graphic TSP. Thus the max entropy algorithm does not appear to be the algorithm that will ultimately resolve the four-thirds conjecture in the affirmative, should that be possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Census Data Generation via Multidimensional Multiset Sum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The US Decennial Census provides valuable data for both research and policy purposes. Census data are subject to a variety of disclosure avoidance techniques prior to release in order to preserve respondent confidentiality. While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by a critical lack of data: The underlying "microdata," which serve as necessary input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting. While the problem we study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance. Finally, we verify that the data we produce are "close" to the desired ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs for Combinatorial Optimization: One-Phase and Two-Phase Heuristics for 2D Bin-Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22255v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 tab...</summary><p>1 table, 6 figures. 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Accepted for the Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |
| **[Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompts and Heuristics for Automatic Algorithm Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24509v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, an increasing number of learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning with Local Search MCMC Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14240v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metric Representations of Network Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00164v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks are structures that encode relationships between pairs of elements or nodes. However, there is no imposed connection between these relationships, i.e., the relationship between two nodes can be independent of every other one in the network, and need not be defined for every possible pair of nodes. This is not true for metric spaces, where the triangle inequality imposes conditions that must be satisfied by triads of distances in the space, and these distances must be defined for every pair of nodes. In this paper, we study how to project networks into q-metric spaces, a generalization of metric spaces that encompasses a larger class of structured representations. In order to do this, we encode as axioms two intuitively desirable properties of the mentioned projections. We show that there is only one way of projecting networks onto q-metric spaces satisfying these axioms. Moreover, for the special case of (regular) metric spaces, this method boils down to computing the shortest path between every node and, for the case of ultrametric spaces, it coincides with single linkage hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we show that the projection method satisfies two properties of practical relevance: optimality, which enables its utilization for the efficient estimation of combinatorial optimization problems, and nestedness, which entails consistency of the structure induced when projecting onto different q-metric spaces. Finally, we illustrate how metric projections can be used to efficiently search networks aided by metric trees.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[A Near-Real-Time Reduction-Based Algorithm for Coloring Massive Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23606v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph coloring problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem with important applications such as register allocation and task scheduling, and it has been extensively studied for decades. However, near-real-time algorithms that can deliver high-quality solutions for very large real-world graphs within a strict time frame remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by systematically investigating reduction rules that shrink the problem size while preserving optimality. For the first time, domination reduction, complement crown reduction, and independent set reduction are applied to large-scale instances. Building on these techniques, we propose RECOL, a reduction-based algorithm that alternates between fast estimation of lower and upper bounds, graph reductions, and heuristic coloring. We evaluate RECOL on a wide range of benchmark datasets, including SNAP, the Network Repository, DIMACS10, and DIMACS2. Experimental results show that RECOL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on very large sparse graphs within one minute. Additional experiments further highlight the pivotal role of reduction techniques in achieving this performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTSP: A Vision Language Models Guided Framework for Large-Scale Traveling Salesman Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23465v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling, and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration. While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for integration into more complex logistics systems.

| **[AutoEP: LLMs-Driven Automation of Hyperparameter Evolution for Metaheuristic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23189v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation, they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AutoEP-3E11</p></details> |  |
| **[IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SB, C...</summary><p>SB, CD, SC, KL are equally contributing authors</p></details> |
| **[A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Currency Arbitrage Problems using D-Wave Advantage2 Quantum Annealer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22591v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently, making use of the principles of quantum mechanics. Companies are increasingly investing in the market of quantum computers, providing the users with the possibility to solve these optimization problems by resorting to quantum computers. This paper explores how Quantum Annealing can be applied to the Currency Arbitrage (CA) optimization problem and its comparative performance against classical methods. A key contribution of the work is an original formulation of the CA problem as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Boolean Optimization) problem. We test the speed of D-wave quantum annealer, using the recently released latest version (Advantage 2).</p></details> | 6 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Structure As Search: Unsupervised Permutation Learning for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04164v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations, without requiring explicit search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making. Our method offers concrete evidence that neural networks can directly capture and exploit combinatorial structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-CMEGroup/MCTS-4-SR.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing for Minimum Bisection Problem: A Machine Learning-based Approach for Penalty Parameter Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19005v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Minimum Bisection Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, with practical applications in areas such as parallel computing, network design, and machine learning. In this paper, we examine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to solve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation lies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the problem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter. Specifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict suitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input graph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the penalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem instance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of minimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions. We test our approach on a large dataset of randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with up to 4,000 nodes, and we compare the results with classical partitioning algorithms, Metis and Kernighan-Lin. Experimental findings demonstrate that our adaptive tuning strategy significantly improves the performance of the quantum annealing hybrid solver and consistently outperforms the classical methods used, indicating its potential as an alternative for the graph partitioning problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Network Slice Placement with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18545v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities, with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within 7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network slice placement in heterogeneous infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Though a cure is too much to hope for, we propose a technological remedy. Large language models (LLMs) can accurately extract propositions from arguments and compile them into natural data structures that enable coherence-driven inference (CDI) via combinatorial optimization. This neurosymbolic architecture naturally separates concerns and enables meaningful judgments about the coherence of arguments that can inform legislative and policy analysis and legal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Data Mining and AI for Law (https://dmail-workshop.github.io/DMAIL2025/)</p></details> |
| **[Gödel Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18383v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Coordination for Evolving Multi-agent Systems: A Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18088v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06253v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: f...</summary><p>v2: fixed spelling Bhattacharya->Bhattacharyya on title page</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as End-to-end Combinatorial Optimization Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16865v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to decision-making scenarios like logistics and manufacturing, are traditionally solved using problem-specific algorithms requiring significant domain expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating CO problem solving, existing approaches rely on intermediate steps such as code generation or solver invocation, limiting their generality and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that empowers LLMs to serve as end-to-end CO solvers by directly mapping natural language problem descriptions to solutions. We propose a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) imparts LLMs with solution generation patterns from domain-specific solvers, while a feasibility-and-optimality-aware reinforcement learning (FOARL) process explicitly mitigates constraint violations and refines solution quality. Evaluation across seven NP-hard CO problems shows that our method achieves a high feasibility rate and reduces the average optimality gap to 1.03-8.20% by tuning a 7B-parameter LLM, surpassing both general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and domain-specific heuristics. Our method establishes a unified language-based pipeline for CO without extensive code execution or manual architectural adjustments for different problems, offering a general and language-driven alternative to traditional solver design while maintaining relative feasibility guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06126v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. In many applications, one has to repeatedly solve VRP instances drawn from the same distribution, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce an optimization framework where a reinforcement learning agent is trained on prior instances and quickly generates initial solutions, which are then further optimized by a genetic algorithm. This framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time budgets. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within one second, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling real-time and interactive routing at scale. EARLI can generalize to new data, as we demonstrate on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city.

| **[Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem. In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variables Ordering Optimization in Boolean Characteristic Set Method Using Simulated Annealing and Machine Learning-based Time Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14754v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving systems of Boolean equations is a fundamental task in symbolic computation and algebraic cryptanalysis, with wide-ranging applications in cryptography, coding theory, and formal verification. Among existing approaches, the Boolean Characteristic Set (BCS) method[1] has emerged as one of the most efficient algorithms for tackling such problems. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the ordering of variables, with solving times varying drastically under different orderings for fixed variable counts n and equations size m. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel optimization framework that synergistically integrates machine learning (ML)-based time prediction with simulated annealing (SA) to efficiently identify high-performance variables orderings. Weconstruct a dataset comprising variable frequency spectrum X and corresponding BCS solving time t for benchmark systems(e.g., n = m = 28). Utilizing this data, we train an accurate ML predictor ft(X) to estimate solving time for any given variables ordering. For each target system, ft serves as the cost function within an SA algorithm, enabling rapid discovery of low-latency orderings that significantly expedite subsequent BCS execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms the standard BCS algorithm[1], Gr\"obner basis method [2] and SAT solver[3], particularly for larger-scale systems(e.g., n = 32). Furthermore, we derive probabilistic time complexity bounds for the overall algorithm using stochastic process theory, establishing a quantitative relationship between predictor accuracy and expected solving complexity. This work provides both a practical acceleration tool for algebraic cryptanalysis and a theoretical foundation for ML-enhanced combinatorial optimization in symbolic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00364v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in quantum computing have spurred substantial research into the application of quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) emerges as a classic and critical paradigm in the field. For a graph G(V, E), TDP entails finding a minimal subset D subset of V that contains no isolated vertices, where every vertex not in D has at least one neighbor in D. TDP finds extensive applications across domains such as computer networks, social networks, and communications. Since the latter half of the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing solution algorithms, which have become foundational to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to TDP remains largely underexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse set of parameters. This paper proves that the upper bound on the number of qubits required to solve TDP is 2|V| + |V| log_2( (2|E|)/|V| - 1 ). Our experimental findings demonstrate that QAOA is effective in addressing TDP: under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes a valid total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for solving TDP and lays a solid groundwork for future investigations in this area.</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |

Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.</p></details> | 36 pages, 20 figures |

Traditional constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability. While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated \textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We wish to withdraw this manuscript as we have identified several technical details that require further optimization and refinement.

| **[JoPA:Explaining Large Language Model's Generation via Joint Prompt Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20404v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models in Many-to-One Matching Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13131v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Location and allocation problem of high-speed train maintenance bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13383v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintenance bases are crucial for the safe and stable operation of high-speed trains, necessitating significant financial investment for their construction and operation. Planning the location and task allocation of these bases in the vast high-speed railway network is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This paper explored the strategic planning of identifying optimal locations for maintenance bases, introducing a bi-level programming model. The upper-level objective was to minimize the annualized total cost, including investment for new or expanding bases and total maintenance costs, while the lower-level focused on dispatching high-speed trains to the most suitable base for maintenance tasks, thereby reducing maintenance operation dispatch costs under various investment scenarios. A case study of the Northwest China high-speed rail network demonstrated the application of this model, and included the sensitivity analysis reflecting maintenance policy reforms. The results showed that establishing a new base in Hami and expanding Xi'an base could minimize the total annualized cost during the planning period, amounting to a total of 2,278.15 million RMB. This paper offers an optimization method for selecting maintenance base locations that ensures reliability and efficiency in maintenance work as the number of trains increases in the future.</p></details> |  |

We intend to (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of theoretical knowledge on the B\&B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms typically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we show that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack and scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly better solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by computational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods. This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at ICALP 2025</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the understudied subject of how, in practice, such formulas can be learned by deep neural networks. Specifically, we analyze boolean formulas associated with model-sampling benchmarks, combinatorial optimization problems, and random 3-CNFs with varying degrees of constrainedness. Our experiments indicate that: (i) neural learning generalizes better than pure rule-based systems and pure symbolic approach; (ii) relatively small and shallow neural networks are very good approximators of formulas associated with combinatorial optimization problems; (iii) smaller formulas seem harder to learn, possibly due to the fewer positive (satisfying) examples available; and (iv) interestingly, underconstrained 3-CNF formulas are more challenging to learn than overconstrained ones. Such findings pave the way for a better understanding, construction, and use of interpretable neurosymbolic AI methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted for NeSy 2025</p></details> |

Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed. In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers. Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</p></details> |  |

The model targets combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order and addresses fundamental limitations of previous OIM models through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance. This work strengthens both the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of oscillator-based Ising machines for complex optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn for substantial modifications in the method and the experiment</p></details> |

Through a numerical study, we investigate the performance of our proposed variational circuits in solving the Max-Cut problem on various graphs of increasing sizes. Our classical algorithm demonstrates improved performance for several graph types to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.

In recent years, many online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20 training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority dispatching rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Robust Anti-jamming Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10280v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS), deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), could enhance anti-jamming communication performance by dynamically configuring channel conditions and establishing reliable air-ground links. However, large-scale ARIS faces critical deployment challenges due to the prohibitive computational complexity of conventional discrete optimization methods and sophisticated jamming threats. In this paper, we introduce a mean field modeling approach to design the spatial configuration of ARIS by a continuous density function, thus bypassing high-dimensional combinatorial optimization. We consider an adaptive jammer which adjusts its position and beamforming to minimize the sum-rate. A key finding reveals that the jammer's optimal strategy is governed by a proximity-directivity trade-off between reducing path loss and enhancing spatial focusing. To combat the jamming, we propose a robust anti-jamming transmission framework that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, the ARIS reflection, and the ARIS spatial distribution to maximize the worst-case sum-rate. By leveraging variational optimization and Riemannian manifold methods, we efficiently solve the functional optimization problems. Our analysis further unveils that the optimal ARIS deployment follows a spatial water-filling principle, concentrating resources in high-gain regions while avoiding interference-prone areas. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably improves the sum-rate. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of UAVs, validating its effectiveness for scalable ARIS-assisted anti-jamming communications.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to $m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m + O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class. Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.</p></details> |  |

While CSB is widely applicable to combinatorial optimization problems, its restriction to binary decision spaces excludes important cases involving non-negative integer flows or allocations, such as the optimal transport and knapsack problems.To overcome this limitation, we propose the multi-play combinatorial semi-bandit (MP-CSB), where a player can select a non-negative integer action and observe multiple feedbacks from a single arm in each round. We propose two algorithms for the MP-CSB. One is a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that is computationally feasible even when the action space is exponentially large with respect to the number of arms, and attains $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret in the stochastic regime, where $T$ is the time horizon. The other is a best-of-both-worlds algorithm, which achieves $O(\log T)$ variance-dependent regret in the stochastic regime and the worst-case $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ regret in the adversarial regime. Moreover, its regret in adversarial one is data-dependent, adapting to the cumulative loss of the optimal action, the total quadratic variation, and the path-length of the loss sequence. Finally, we numerically show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods in the CSB literature.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a quantum-assisted framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a link-based formulation of VRP. Our approach encodes flow conservation and subtour elimination directly into the cost Hamiltonian, preserving graph structure while avoiding ancillary qubits. We design and implement the full pipeline on a gate-based quantum computer, including problem encoding, circuit synthesis, and execution on IBM Quantum System One. Experimental results on small VRP instances highlight the effects of penalty scaling, coefficient normalization, and circuit depth on solution feasibility under hardware noise. While scalability remains constrained by circuit complexity and decoherence, the study demonstrates a practical pathway for implementing VRP on quantum hardware and identifies methodological directions for advancing near-term quantum optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively.

Given two linear matroids over the same ground set, the linear matroid intersection problem asks you to find a common independent set of maximum size. The deep interest in linear matroid intersection is due to the fact that it generalises many classical problems in theoretical computer science, such as bipartite matching, edge disjoint spanning trees, rainbow spanning tree, and many more. We study this problem in the model of catalytic computation: space-bounded machines are granted access to \textit{catalytic space}, which is additional working memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the end of its computation. Although linear matroid intersection has had a polynomial time algorithm for over 50 years, it remains an important open problem to show that linear matroid intersection belongs to any well studied subclass of $\mathsf{P}$. We address this problem for the class catalytic logspace ($\mathsf{CL}$) with a polynomial time bound ($\mathsf{CLP}$). Recently, Agarwala and Mertz (2025) showed that bipartite maximum matching can be computed in the class $\mathsf{CLP}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$. This was the first subclass of $\mathsf{P}$ shown to contain bipartite matching, and additionally the first problem outside $\mathsf{TC}^1$ shown to be contained in $\mathsf{CL}$. We significantly improve the result of Agarwala and Mertz by showing that linear matroid intersection can be computed in $\mathsf{CLP}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via Dynamic Joint-State Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07234v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance, but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems: Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*): Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method (Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning, offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient deep reinforcement learning environment for flexible job-shop scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07019v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world. In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed. However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL and PDR scheduling methods.</p></details> |  |

While most existing approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine specific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of individual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the NP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the instance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM collaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally efficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate a tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the search space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including rigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted ablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across 1,050 generated instances of varying complexity. Results show that our top-performing hybrid, BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick, achieves statistically significant improvements over the baseline, particularly on the most complex instances. Our findings confirm that leveraging an LLM to produce an a priori, instance-driven heuristic bias is a valuable approach for enhancing metaheuristics in complex optimization domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a journal for review</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent State Encoders for Efficient Neural Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05084v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small, since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of $3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem (OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to showcase the practical relevance of our findings.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |

While they have been tackled mainly via handcrafted heuristics in the past, advances in neural networks have motivated the development of general methods to learn heuristics from data. Many approaches utilize a neural network to directly construct a solution, but are limited in further improving based on already constructed solutions at inference time. Our approach, Moco, defines a lightweight solution construction procedure, guided by a single continuous vector $\theta$ (called heatmap) and learns a neural network to update $\theta$ for a single instance of a COP at inference time. The update is based on various features of the current search state. The training procedure is budget aware, targeting the overall best solution found during the entire search. Moco is a fully learnable meta optimizer not utilizing problem specific heuristics or requiring optimal solutions for training. We test Moco on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and show that it significantly improves over other heatmap based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Batched Stochastic Matching Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04194v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates, thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Supportedness in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13842v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses an inconsistency in various definitions of supported non-dominated points within multi-objective combinatorial problems (MOCO). MOCO problems are known to contain supported and unsupported non-dominated points, with the latter typically outnumbering the former. Supported points are, in general, easier to determine, can serve as representations, and are used in two-phase methods to generate the entire non-dominated point set. Despite their importance, several different characterizations for supported efficient solutions (and supported non-dominated points) are used in the literature. While these definitions are equivalent for multi-objective linear problems, they can yield different sets of supported non-dominated points for MOCO problems. We show by an example that these definitions are not equivalent for MOCO or general multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, we analyze the structural and computational properties of the resulting sets of supported non-dominated points. These considerations motivate us to summarize equivalent definitions and characterizations for supported efficient solutions and to introduce a distinction between supported and weakly supported efficient solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.12867</p></details> |

Most existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 24 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

This work presents a novel methodology for training Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) by reformulating the parameter optimization task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, our approach directly leverages the Hamiltonian of the chosen VQA ansatz and employs an adaptive, metaheuristic optimization scheme. This optimization strategy provides a rich set of configurable parameters which enables the adaptation to specific problem characteristics and available computational resources. The proposed framework is generalizable to arbitrary Hamiltonians and integrates a recursive refinement strategy to progressively approximate high-quality solutions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to significantly reduce computational overhead compared to classical and evolutionary optimizers, while achieving comparable or superior solution quality. These findings suggest that quantum annealers can serve as a scalable alternative to classical optimizers for VQA training, particularly in scenarios affected by barren plateaus and noisy gradient estimates, and open new possibilities for hybrid quantum gate - quantum annealing - classical optimization models in near-term quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 4 appendix, 14 images</p></details> |
| **[Embodying computation in nonlinear perturbative metamaterials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01625v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing metamaterials that carry out advanced computations poses a significant challenge. A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

These problems include (but are not restricted to) three families of problems: (i) variants of metric dimension, where one wants to choose a small set $S$ of vertices of the graph such that every vertex is uniquely determined by its ordered vector of distances to the vertices of $S$; (ii) variants of geodetic sets, where one wants to select a small set $S$ of vertices such that any vertex lies on some shortest path between two vertices of $S$; (iii) variants of path covers, where one wants to select a small set of paths such that every vertex or edge belongs to one of the paths. We generalize and/or improve previous results in the area which show that the optimal values for these problems can be upper-bounded by a linear function of the cyclomatic number and the degree~1-vertices of the graph. To this end, we develop and enhance a technique recently introduced in [C. Lu, Q. Ye, C. Zhu. Algorithmic aspect on the minimum (weighted) doubly resolving set problem of graphs, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 44:2029--2039, 2022] and give near-optimal bounds in several cases. This solves (in some cases fully, in some cases partially) some conjectures and open questions from the literature. The method, based on breadth-first search, is of algorithmic nature and thus, all the constructions can be computed in linear time. Our results also imply an algorithmic consequence for the computation of the optimal solutions: for some of the problems, they can be computed in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version appeared in the proceedings of the conference FCT 2023</p></details> |

To address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO, that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing, addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem. This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Elicitation for Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization with Active Learning and Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11435v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life combinatorial optimization problems often involve several conflicting objectives, such as price, product quality and sustainability. A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

However, the underlying fitness landscape, which is critical for understanding its search behavior, remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly-used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. Moreover, we adopt four different methods for algorithm similarity measurement and study their correlations to algorithm performance and operator behaviour. These insights not only deepen our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical insights for designing more effective LAS methods.</p></details> |  |

Its NP-hard nature makes it increasingly difficult to obtain exact solutions as the graph size grows. This paper introduces ParDS, an exact algorithm developed to address the MDS problem within the branch-and-bound framework. ParDS features two key innovations: an advanced linear programming technique that yields tighter lower bounds and a set of novel reduction rules that dynamically simplify instances throughout the solving process. Compared to the leading exact algorithms presented at IJCAI 2023 and 2024, ParDS demonstrates theoretically superior lower-bound quality. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets highlight several significant advantages of ParDS: it achieves fastest solving times in 70% of graph categories, especially on large, sparse graphs, delivers a speed-up of up to 3,411 times on the fastest individual instance, and successfully solves 16 out of 43 instances that other algorithms were unable to resolve within the 5-hour time limit. These findings establish ParDS as a state-of-the-art solution for exactly solving the MDS problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10811v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions by combining prior knowledge with ongoing function evaluations. BO constructs a probabilistic surrogate model of the objective function given the covariates, which is in turn used to inform the selection of future evaluation points through an acquisition function. For smooth continuous search spaces, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as the surrogate model as they offer analytical access to posterior predictive distributions, thus facilitating the computation and optimization of acquisition functions. However, in complex scenarios involving optimization over categorical or mixed covariate spaces, GPs may not be ideal. This paper introduces Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization (SBBO) as a novel approach to optimizing acquisition functions that only requires sampling-based access to posterior predictive distributions. SBBO allows the use of surrogate probabilistic models tailored for combinatorial spaces with discrete variables. Any Bayesian model in which posterior inference is carried out through Markov chain Monte Carlo can be selected as the surrogate model in SBBO. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of SBBO using various choices of surrogate models in applications involving combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Statistics and Computing</p></details> |

This advancement has focused attention on formulating combinatorial optimization problems as quadratic polynomials. To improve the performance of solving large QUBO problems, it is essential to minimize the number of binary variables used in the objective function. In this paper, we propose a QUBO formulation that offers a bit capacity advantage over conventional quadratization techniques. As a key application, this formulation significantly reduces the number of binary variables required for score-based Bayesian network structure learning. Experimental results on $16$ instances, ranging from $37$ to $223$ variables, demonstrate that our approach requires notably fewer binary variables than quadratization. Moreover, an annealing machine that implement our formulation have outperformed existing algorithms in score maximization.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures, AAAI2025</p></details> |

E-graph extraction is a challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However, traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities, guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster. Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at https://github.com/Yu-Maryland/e-boost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD 2025</p></details> |

This technique combines the computation of a reduced basis via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and artificial neural networks (NNs) for the construction of fast surrogates of said parametric maps. In contrast to the existing literature, which has studied the approximation properties of this kind of architecture on a continuous level, we provide a fully discrete error analysis of this approach. More precisely, our estimates also account for discretization errors during the construction of the NN architecture. We consider the number of reduced basis in the approximation of the solution manifold, truncation in the parameter space, and, most importantly, the number of samples in the computation of the reduced space, together with the effect of the use of NNs in the approximation of the reduced coefficients. Following this error analysis, we provide a-priori bounds on the required POD tolerance, the resulting POD ranks, and NN parameters to maintain the order of convergence of quasi Monte Carlo sampling techniques. We conclude this work by showcasing the applicability of this method through a practical industrial application: the sound-soft acoustic scattering problem by a parametrically defined scatterer in three physical dimensions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present new statistical methods for estimating the reproduction number based on the popular model of \citet{cori2013new} which defines the effective reproduction number based on self-exciting dynamics of new infections. Such a model is conceptually simple and less susceptible to misspecifications than more complicated multi-compartment models. However, statistical inference is challenging, and the previous literature has either relied on proxy data and/or a two-step approach in which the number of infections are first estimated. In contrast, we present a coherent Bayesian method that approximates the joint posterior of daily new infections and reproduction numbers using a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Comparing our method to the state-of-the-art three-step estimation procedure of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, both using daily confirmed cases from Switzerland in the Covid-19 epidemic and simulated data, we find that our method is more accurate in terms of point estimates and uncertainty quantification, especially near the beginning and end of an observation period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Collision Risk Estimation through Gauss-Legendre Cubature and Non-Homogeneous Poisson Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18819v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overtaking in high-speed autonomous racing demands precise, real-time estimation of collision risk; particularly in wheel-to-wheel scenarios where safety margins are minimal. Existing methods for collision risk estimation either rely on simplified geometric approximations, like bounding circles, or perform Monte Carlo sampling which leads to overly conservative motion planning behavior at racing speeds. We introduce the Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR) algorithm, a principled two-stage integration method that estimates collision risk by combining Gauss-Legendre with a non-homogeneous Poisson process over time. GLR produces accurate risk estimates that account for vehicle geometry and trajectory uncertainty. In experiments across 446 overtaking scenarios in a high-fidelity Formula One racing simulation, GLR outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines achieving an average error reduction of 77% and surpassing the next-best method by 52%, all while running at 1000 Hz. The framework is general and applicable to broader motion planning contexts beyond autonomous racing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25454v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Monte Carlo with Gaussian Mixture Approximation for Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16028v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By formulating the inverse problem of partial differential equations (PDEs) as a statistical inference problem, the Bayesian approach provides a general framework for quantifying uncertainties. In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</p></details> | 36 pages |

This paper explores control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service. Using this framework, we propose a model predictive control approach to reduce both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that our algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art benchmark optimization strategy and can significantly reduce station operator costs.</p></details> |  |

By applying the corresponding inverse cumulative distribution function, the problem is transformed into integrating an induced function over the unit cube $(0,1)^{s}$. We introduce a new orthonormal system: \emph{order~2 localized Walsh functions}. These basis functions retain the approximation power of classical Walsh functions for twice-differentiable integrands while inheriting the spatial localization of Haar wavelets. Localization is crucial because the transformed integrand is typically unbounded at the boundary. We show that the worst-case quasi-Monte Carlo integration error decays like $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/\lambda})$ for every $\lambda \in (1/2,1]$. As an application, we consider elliptic partial differential equations with a finite number of log-normal random coefficients and show that our error estimates remain valid for their stochastic Galerkin discretizations by applying a suitable importance sampling density.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochasticity and Practical Identifiability in Epidemic Models: A Monte Carlo Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26577v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the practical identifiability of epidemic models is essential for determining whether parameters can be meaningfully estimated from observed data. Monte Carlo (MC) methods provide an accessible and intuitive framework; however, their standard implementation - perturbing deterministic trajectories with independent Gaussian noise - rests on assumptions poorly suited to epidemic processes, which are inherently stochastic, temporally correlated, and highly variable, especially in small populations or under slow transmission. In this study, we investigate the structure of stochastic variability in the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model across a range of epidemiological regimes, and assess whether it can be represented within the independent Gaussian noise framework. We show that continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) trajectories consistently exhibit super-Poissonian variability and strong temporal dependence. Through coverage analysis, we further demonstrate that independent Gaussian noise systematically underestimates the variability of the underlying stochastic process, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about parameter identifiability. In addition, we propose a hybrid simulation approach that introduces time- and amplitude-dependent variability into deterministic ODE trajectories, preserving computational efficiency while capturing key features of epidemic stochasticity. Our findings highlight the limitations of the standard MC algorithm and provide a pathway for incorporating more realistic noise structures into epidemic inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Inference Framework for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26573v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth, provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple scatterers originating from a single automotive target commonly referred to as an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling facilitated through Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU) and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Comparison of nested geometry treatments within GPU-based Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations of fission reactors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13849v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monte Carlo (MC) neutron transport provides detailed estimates of radiological quantities within fission reactors. This involves tracking individual neutrons through a computational geometry. CPU-based MC codes use multiple polymorphic tracker types with different tracking algorithms to exploit the repeated configurations of reactors, but virtual function calls have high overhead on the GPU. The Shift MC code was modified to support GPU-based tracking with three strategies: dynamic polymorphism with virtual functions, static polymorphism, and a single tracker type with tree-based acceleration. On the Frontier supercomputer these methods achieve 77.8%, 91.2%, and 83.4%, respectively, of the tracking rate obtained using a specialized tracker optimized for rectilinear-grid-based reactors. This indicates that all three methods are suitable for typical reactor problems in which tracking does not dominate runtime. The flexibility of the single tracker method is highlighted with a hexagonal-grid microreactor problem, performed without hexagonal-grid-specific tracking routines, providing a 2.19$\times$ speedup over CPU execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Planning for Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26435v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior control performance, outperforming all competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Order of Magnitude Time Complexity Reduction for Gaussian Graphical Model Posterior Sampling Using a Reverse Telescoping Block Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26385v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of fully Bayesian posterior estimation and uncertainty quantification in undirected Gaussian graphical models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) under recently-developed element-wise graphical priors, such as the graphical horseshoe. Unlike the conjugate Wishart family, these priors are non-conjugate; but have the advantage that they naturally allow one to encode a prior belief of sparsity in the off-diagonal elements of the precision matrix, without imposing a structure on the entire matrix. Unfortunately, for a graph with $p$ nodes and with $n$ samples, the state-of-the-art MCMC approaches for the element-wise priors achieve a per iteration complexity of $O(p^4),$ which is prohibitive when $p\gg n$. In this regime, we develop a suitably reparameterized MCMC with per iteration complexity of $O(p^3)$, providing a one-order of magnitude improvement, and consequently bringing the computational cost at par with the conjugate Wishart family, which is also $O(p^3)$ due to a use of the classical Bartlett decomposition, but this decomposition does not apply outside the Wishart family. Importantly, the proposed benefit is obtained solely due to our reparameterization in an MCMC scheme targeting the true posterior, that reverses the recently developed telescoping block decomposition of Bhadra et al. (2024), in a suitable sense. There is no variational or any other approximate Bayesian computation scheme considered in this paper that compromises targeting the true posterior. Simulations and the analysis of a breast cancer data set confirm both the correctness and better algorithmic scaling of the proposed reverse telescoping sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence Intervals for Conditional Covariances of Natural Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26348v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In structural health monitoring (SHM), sensor measurements are collected, and damage-sensitive features such as natural frequencies are extracted for damage detection. However, these features depend not only on damage but are also influenced by various confounding factors, including environmental conditions and operational parameters. These factors must be identified, and their effects must be removed before further analysis. However, it has been shown that confounding variables may influence the mean and the covariance of the extracted features. This is particularly significant since the covariance is an essential building block in many damage detection tools. To account for the complex relationships resulting from the confounding factors, a nonparametric kernel approach can be used to estimate a conditional covariance matrix. By doing so, the covariance matrix is allowed to change depending on the identified confounding factor, thus providing a clearer understanding of how, for example, temperature influences the extracted features. This paper presents two bootstrap-based methods for obtaining confidence intervals for the conditional covariances, providing a way to quantify the uncertainty associated with the conditional covariance estimator. A proof-of-concept Monte Carlo study compares the two bootstrap versions proposed and evaluates their effectiveness. Finally, the methods are applied to the natural frequency data of the KW51 railway bridge near Leuven, Belgium. This real-world application highlights the practical implications of the findings. It underscores the importance of accurately accounting for confounding factors to generate more reliable diagnostic values with fewer false alarms.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, url: https://iomac2025.sciencesconf.org/591249/document</p></details> |
| **[One-Token Rollout: Guiding Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Policy Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26313v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Inexact Computations in Multilevel Monte Carlo and Other Sampling Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05533v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilevel sampling methods, such as multilevel and multifidelity Monte Carlo, multilevel stochastic collocation, or delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo, have become standard uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools for a wide class of forward and inverse problems. The underlying idea is to achieve faster convergence by leveraging a hierarchy of models, such as partial differential equation (PDE) or stochastic differential equation (SDE) discretisations with increasing accuracy. By optimally redistributing work among the levels, multilevel methods can achieve significant performance improvement compared to single level methods working with one high-fidelity model. Intuitively, approximate solutions on coarser levels can tolerate large computational error without affecting the overall accuracy. We show how this can be used in high-performance computing applications to obtain a significant performance gain. As a use case, we analyse the computational error in the standard multilevel Monte Carlo method and formulate an adaptive algorithm which determines a minimum required computational accuracy on each level of discretisation. We show two examples of how the inexactness can be converted into actual gains using an elliptic PDE with lognormal random coefficients. Using a low precision sparse direct solver combined with iterative refinement results in a simulated gain in memory references of up to $3.5\times$ compared to the reference double precision solver; while using a MINRES iterative solver, a practical speedup of up to $1.5\times$ in terms of FLOPs is achieved. These results provide a step in the direction of energy-aware scientific computing, with significant potential for energy savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral gap of Metropolis-within-Gibbs under log-concavity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26175v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) algorithm is a widely used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions when exact conditional sampling is intractable. We study MwG with Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) updates, using proposal variances tuned to match the target's conditional variances. Assuming the target $\pi$ is a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution with condition number $\kappa$, we establish a spectral gap lower bound of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa d)$ for the random-scan version of MwG, improving on the previously available $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa^2 d)$ bound. This is obtained by developing sharp estimates of the conductance of one-dimensional RWM kernels, which can be of independent interest. The result shows that MwG can mix substantially faster with variance-adaptive proposals and that its mixing performance is just a constant factor worse than that of the exact Gibbs sampler, thus providing theoretical support to previously observed empirical behavior.</p></details> | 20 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03311v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters</p></details> |

In Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses. Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly release the dataset and model to support future research.</p></details> |  |

Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest (QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs. Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.</p></details> |  |

We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> |

We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss metric.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we revisit the randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) for sampling from high dimensional distributions without log-concavity. Under the gradient Lipschitz condition and the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove a uniform-in-time error bound in $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance of order $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ for the RLMC sampling algorithm, which matches the best one in the literature under the log-concavity condition. Moreover, when the gradient of the potential $U$ is non-globally Lipschitz with superlinear growth, modified RLMC algorithms are proposed and analyzed, with non-asymptotic error bounds established. To the best of our knowledge, the modified RLMC algorithms and their non-asymptotic error bounds are new in the non-globally Lipschitz setting.</p></details> |  |

Reliability Analysis in Detection & Generation Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17550v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was submitted without the knowledge of co-authors and approval of the co-authors' institutes.

We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability.Guided by this hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold, enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025-AI4Science</p></details> |

Exploration is hindered by one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent, AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark, MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results</p></details> |  |

The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To evaluate how well the model captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Argen...</summary><p>Argentine Congress of Embedded Systems (2025)</p></details> |

An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |
| **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Prediction via Bayesian Intention Inference under Unknown Goals and Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24928v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

When these data have more zeros than expected by the most used count distributions, it is common to employ a zero-inflated regression model. However, the interpretability of these models is much lower than the most used count regression models. In this work, we introduce a more interpretable regression model for count data with excess of zeros based on a reparameterization of the zero-inflated Poisson distribution. We discuss inferential and diagnostic tools and perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed regression model is illustrated through an application on children mortality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Evidence Gap: reddemcee, a Fast Adaptive Parallel Tempering Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24870v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) excels at sampling complex posteriors but traditionally lags behind nested sampling in accurate evidence estimation, which is crucial for model comparison in astrophysical problems. We introduce reddemcee, an Adaptive Parallel Tempering Ensemble Sampler, aiming to close this gap by simultaneously presenting next-generation automated temperature-ladder adaptation techniques and robust, low-bias evidence estimators. reddemcee couples an affine-invariant stretch move with five interchangeable ladder-adaptation objectives, Uniform Swap Acceptance Rate, Swap Mean Distance, Gaussian-Area Overlap, Small Gaussian Gap, and Equalised Thermodynamic Length, implemented through a common differential update rule. Three evidence estimators are provided: Curvature-aware Thermodynamic Integration (TI+), Geometric-Bridge Stepping Stones (SS+), and a novel Hybrid algorithm that blends both approaches (H+). Performance and accuracy are benchmarked on n-dimensional Gaussian Shells, Gaussian Egg-box, Rosenbrock Functions, and exoplanet radial-velocity time-series of HD 20794. Across Shells up to 15 dimensions, reddemcee presents roughly 7 times the effective sampling speed of the best dynamic nested sampling configuration. The TI+, SS+ and H+ estimators recover estimates under 3 percent error and supply realistic uncertainties with as few as six temperatures. In the HD 20794 case study, reddemcee reproduces literature model rankings and yields tighter yet consistent planetary parameters compared with dynesty, with evidence errors that track run-to-run dispersion. By unifying fast ladder adaptation with reliable evidence estimators, reddemcee delivers strong throughput and accurate evidence estimates, often matching, and occasionally surpassing, dynamic nested sampling, while preserving the rich posterior information which makes MCMC indispensable for modern Bayesian inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: R...</summary><p>v2: Revised after referee comments; resubmitted to A&A on 24 Sep 2025</p></details> |
| **[Covariance-Adaptive Bouncy Particle Samplers via Split Lagrangian Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24847v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) provide a powerful framework for continuous-time Monte Carlo, with the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS) as a prominent example. Recent advances through the Metropolised PDMP framework allow local adaptivity in step size and effective path length, the latter acting as a refreshment rate. However, current PDMP samplers cannot adapt to local changes in the covariance structure of the target distribution. We extend BPS by introducing a position-dependent velocity distribution that varies with the local covariance structure of the target. Building on ideas from Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and its velocity-based variant, Lagrangian Dynamical Monte Carlo, we construct a PDMP for which changes in the metric trigger additional velocity update events. Using a metric derived from the target Hessian, the resulting algorithm adapts to the local covariance structure. Through a series of controlled experiments, we provide practical guidance on when the proposed covariance-adaptive BPS should be preferred over standard PDMP algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Pseudo-Marginal Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24820v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Pseudo-Marginal (PM) algorithm is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used to sample from a target distribution when its density is inaccessible, but can be estimated with a non-negative unbiased estimator. Its performance depends on a key parameter, N, the number of iterations (or particles) used to approximate the target density. Larger values of N yield more accurate estimates but at increased running time. Previous studies has provided guidelines for selecting an optimal value of N to balance this tradeoff. However, this approach involves multiple steps and manual adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an adaptive version of the PM algorithm, where N is automatically adjusted during the iterative process toward its optimal value, thus eliminating the need for manual intervention. This algorithm ensures convergence under certain conditions. On two examples, including a real data problem on pulmonary infection in preschool children, the proposed algorithm compares favorably to the existing approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Bayesian inference for Markov switching diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09126v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the first exact Bayesian methodology for the problem of inference in discretely observed regime switching diffusions. Switching diffusion models extend ordinary diffusions by allowing for jumps in instantaneous drift and volatility. The jumps are driven by a latent, continuous time Markov switching process. We address the problem through an MCMC and an MCEM algorithm that target the exact posterior of diffusion parameters and the latent regime process. The algorithms are exact in the sense that they target the correct posterior distribution of the continuous model, so that the errors are due to Monte Carlo only. We illustrate the method on numerical examples, including an empirical analysis of the method's scalability in the length of the time series, and find that it is comparable in computational cost with discrete approximations while avoiding their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Semiparametric Inference for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24634v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a semiparametric framework for inference on the mean response in missing-data settings using a corrected posterior distribution. Our approach is tailored to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), which is a powerful predictive method but whose nonsmoothness complicate asymptotic theory with multi-dimensional covariates. When using BART combined with Bayesian bootstrap weights, we establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem and show that the limit distribution generally contains a bias term. To address this, we introduce RoBART, a posterior bias-correction that robustifies BART for valid inference on the mean response. Monte Carlo studies support our theory, demonstrating reduced bias and improved coverage relative to existing procedures using BART.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 16 figures, reviewed version.

| **[From Static to Dynamic: Adaptive Monte Carlo Search for Mathematical Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24351v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500 with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision. Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

Prior work in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by showing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under a carefully constructed semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite expected sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Nonparametric Bayesian Local-Global Model for Enhanced Adverse Event Signal Detection in Spontaneous Reporting System Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10881v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spontaneous reporting system databases are key resources for post-marketing surveillance, providing real-world evidence (RWE) on the adverse events (AEs) of regulated drugs or other medical products. Various statistical methods have been proposed for AE signal detection in these databases, flagging drug-specific AEs with disproportionately high observed counts compared to expected counts under independence. However, signal detection remains challenging for rare AEs or newer drugs, which receive small observed and expected counts and thus suffer from reduced statistical power. Principled information sharing on signal strengths across drugs/AEs is crucial in such cases to enhance signal detection. However, existing methods typically ignore complex between-drug associations on AE signal strengths, limiting their ability to detect signals. We propose novel local-global mixture Dirichlet process (DP) prior-based nonparametric Bayesian models to capture these associations, enabling principled information sharing between drugs while balancing flexibility and shrinkage for each drug, thereby enhancing statistical power. We develop efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for implementation and employ a false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled, false negative rate (FNR)-optimized hypothesis testing framework for AE signal detection. Extensive simulations demonstrate our methods' superior sensitivity -- often surpassing existing approaches by a twofold or greater margin -- while strictly controlling the FDR. An application to FDA FAERS data on statin drugs further highlights our methods' effectiveness in real-world AE signal detection. Software implementing our methods is provided as supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |

Building on a previous single-target algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree, enabling scalable and efficient planning. Departing from uniform power allocation, which is often suboptimal with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), our approach predicts each target's future angular position and expected received power based on its expected range. These predictions guide adaptive waveform design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring sufficient power for high-SNR targets. Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive, efficient multi-target radar systems.</p></details> |  |

Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO) provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods for compound lens design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g., curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type (e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs achievable by automated lens design.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, project website: https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/automated_lens_design/</p></details> |

Parallel Tempering (PT) enhances MCMC's sample efficiency through annealing and parallel computation, propagating samples from tractable reference distributions to intractable targets via state swapping across interpolating distributions. The effectiveness of PT is limited by the often minimal overlap between adjacent distributions in challenging problems, which requires increasing the computational resources to compensate. We introduce a framework that accelerates PT by leveraging neural samplers -- including normalising flows, diffusion models, and controlled diffusions -- to reduce the required overlap. Our approach utilises neural samplers in parallel, circumventing the computational burden of neural samplers while preserving the asymptotic consistency of classical PT. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically on a variety of multimodal sampling problems that our method improves sample quality, reduces the computational cost compared to classical PT, and enables efficient free energy/normalising constant estimation.</p></details> |  |

Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs. We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster, has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.</p></details> | Under review |

| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |

However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Piecewise Deterministic Sampling for Constrained Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05462v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel class of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP) that are designed to sample from constrained probability distributions $\pi$ supported on a convex set $\mathcal{M}$. This class of PDMPs adapts the concept of a mirror map from convex optimisation to address sampling problems. Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Stochastic Entanglement Configuration for Constructive Entanglement Topologies in Quantum Machine Learning with Application to Cardiac MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11401v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CSC-MPPI: A Novel Constrained MPPI Framework with DBSCAN for Reliable Obstacle Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16386v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes Constrained Sampling Cluster Model Predictive Path Integral (CSC-MPPI), a novel constrained formulation of MPPI designed to enhance trajectory optimization while enforcing strict constraints on system states and control inputs. Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chance-Constrained Sampling-Based MPC for Collision Avoidance in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08520v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating safely in dynamic and uncertain environments is challenging due to uncertainties in perception and motion. This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Non-Reversible Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11743v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution on a constrained domain. We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |
| **[A Novel Constrained Sampling Method for Efficient Exploration in Materials and Chemical Mixture Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient exploration of multicomponent material composition spaces is often limited by time and financial constraints, particularly when mixture and synthesis constraints exist. Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The software and case studies are available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>feedb...</summary><p>feedback welcome, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[CCS: Controllable and Constrained Sampling with Diffusion Models via Initial Noise Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04670v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks, producing high-quality outputs across diverse domains. However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

At the moment, there is only one test suggested that relies upon random projections. We propose a novel test termed {\alpha}-Energy Based Test ({\alpha}-EBT) to compare the multivariate distributions of two (or more) compositional data sets. Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Learning at a Glance: Towards Interpretable Data-limited Continual Semantic Segmentation via Semantic-Invariance Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15429v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual semantic segmentation (CSS) based on incremental learning (IL) is a great endeavour in developing human-like segmentation models. However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

With this work we aim to provide an integrative view and framework to combine methods from the fields of MCMC, constrained optimization, as well as robotics, and gain insights in their strengths from empirical evaluations. We propose NLP Sampling as a general problem formulation, propose a family of restarting two-phase methods as a framework to integrated methods from across the fields, and evaluate them on analytical and robotic manipulation planning problems. Complementary to this, we provide several conceptual discussions, e.g. on the role of Lagrange parameters, global sampling, and the idea of a Diffused NLP and a corresponding model-based denoising sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Algorithms for Weighted Constrained Sampling and Weighted Model Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12816v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problems of weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, where we are given a propositional formula and a weight for each world. The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm for approximate sampling from distributions whose support is a compact and convex set. This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

When qualified volunteers are more than the budget allowed, we recommend a D-optimal sampling strategy based on the optimal design theory and develop a constrained lift-one algorithm to find the optimal allocation. Unlike the literature which mainly deals with linear models, our solution solves the constrained sampling problem under fairly general statistical models, including generalized linear models and multinomial logistic models, and with more general constraints. We justify theoretically the optimality of our sampling strategy and show by simulation studies and real-world examples the advantages over simple random sampling and proportionally stratified sampling strategies.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Penalized Overdamped and Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00570v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution $\pi(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ when $x$ is constrained to lie on a convex body $\mathcal{C}$. Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

| **[Unbiased constrained sampling with Self-Concordant Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11925v3)** | 2023-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |
| **[Black-box optimization on hyper-rectangle using Recursive Modified Pattern Search and application to ROC-based Classification Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08616v4)** | 2023-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In statistics, it is common to encounter multi-modal and non-smooth likelihood (or objective function) maximization problems, where the parameters have known upper and lower bounds. This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |

In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement.

| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS4Net: Two-Stage Sample Selective Strategy for Rotating Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03116v1)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

For each problem, we propose a privacy preserving algorithm using stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques, and show that it can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. To the best of our knowledge, SSCA has not been used for solving federated optimization, and federated optimization with nonconvex constraints has not been investigated. Next, we customize the two proposed SSCA-based algorithms to two application examples, and provide closed-form solutions for the respective approximate convex problems at each iteration of SSCA. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate inherent advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed, communication cost and model specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICC 2021</p></details> |

They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06311v3)** | 2020-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic execution and fuzzing are two complementary coverage-based testing techniques. How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06922v1)** | 2020-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20460v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present new statistical methods for estimating the reproduction number based on the popular model of \citet{cori2013new} which defines the effective reproduction number based on self-exciting dynamics of new infections. Such a model is conceptually simple and less susceptible to misspecifications than more complicated multi-compartment models. However, statistical inference is challenging, and the previous literature has either relied on proxy data and/or a two-step approach in which the number of infections are first estimated. In contrast, we present a coherent Bayesian method that approximates the joint posterior of daily new infections and reproduction numbers using a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Comparing our method to the state-of-the-art three-step estimation procedure of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, both using daily confirmed cases from Switzerland in the Covid-19 epidemic and simulated data, we find that our method is more accurate in terms of point estimates and uncertainty quantification, especially near the beginning and end of an observation period.</p></details> |  |

The model assumes that the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variables, and hence that there exists a stable long-run relationship between the two variables despite their nonstationary behavior. We also assume that the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to evaluating the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 GRD time series using Bayesian analysis for change point problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19526v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based flood detection methods face critical limitations that hinder operational deployment. Supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled training data, exhibit poor geographical transferability, and may fail to adapt to new regions without additional training examples. Existing approaches do not fully exploit the rich temporal information available in SAR time series, instead relying on simple change detection between pre- and post-flood images or supplementary datasets that often introduce error propagation. These limitations prevent effective automated flood monitoring in data-scarce regions where disaster response is most needed. To address these limitations, we develop a novel training-free approach by adapting Bayesian analysis for change point problems, specifically for automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected time series data. Our method statistically models the temporal behavior of SAR backscatter intensity over a one-year baseline period, then computes the posterior probability of change points at flood observation dates. This approach eliminates supervised learning dependencies by using Bayesian inference to identify when backscatter deviations exceed expected normal variations, leveraging inherent statistical properties of time series data. Validation across three diverse geographical contexts using the UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional thresholding and deep learning approaches, achieving F1 scores up to 0.76. This enables immediate deployment to any region with SAR coverage, providing critical advantages for disaster response.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Federated Dynamic Modeling and Learning for Spatiotemporal Data Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04528v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework for forecasting complex spatiotemporal data, improving upon recent state-of-the-art models. In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture long-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture significantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns in diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework integrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a critical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated parameters from the central server into local models, ensuring only the most effective updates are retained and improving both the robustness and accuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world applications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand forecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting in urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time, region-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential of leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context. We provide our algorithms as open-source on GitHub</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale time series reshape module that effectively captures cross-period patch interactions and variable dependencies. Building on this, we develop MS-DFTVNet, the multi-scale 3D deformable convolutional framework tailored for long-term forecasting. Moreover, to handle the inherently uneven distribution of temporal features, we introduce a context-aware dynamic deformable convolution mechanism, which further enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MS-DFTVNet not only significantly outperforms strong baselines but also achieves an average improvement of about 7.5% across six public datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pattern-Specific Experts for Time Series Forecasting Under Patch-level Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09836v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TFPS, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach. The data and codes are available: https://github.com/syrGitHub/TFPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReNF: Rethinking the Design Space of Neural Long-Term Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25914v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[Stab-QRAM: An All-Clifford Quantum Random Access Memory for Special Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26494v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying K\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[fev-bench: A Realistic Benchmark for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26468v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates. Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100 forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates. Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline models, and identify promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Do Time Series Foundation Models Paint the Landscape of Real-World Benchmarks ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> |  |

Advances in these methods have led to ever-increasing data sizes and, consequently, interest and development of out-of-core processing and visualization techniques, although mostly as specialized solutions. Here we present Palace, an open-source, cross-platform, general-purpose library for interactive and accelerated out-of-core tensor processing and visualization. Through a high-performance asynchronous concurrent architecture and a simple compute-graph interface, Palace enables the interactive development of out-of-core pipelines on workstation hardware. We demonstrate on benchmarks that Palace outperforms or matches state-of-the-art systems for volume rendering and hierarchical random-walker segmentation and demonstrate applicability in use cases involving tensors from 2D images up to 4D time series datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting, with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

Social media data provides a new perspective for depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model, which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally, the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression screening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzy Jump Models for Soft and Hard Clustering of Multivariate Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26029v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical jump models have been recently introduced to detect persistent regimes by clustering temporal features and discouraging frequent regime changes. However, they are limited to hard clustering and thereby do not account for uncertainty in state assignments. This work presents an extension of the statistical jump model that incorporates uncertainty estimation in cluster membership. Leveraging the similarities between statistical jump models and the fuzzy c-means framework, our fuzzy jump model sequentially estimates time-varying state probabilities. Our approach offers high flexibility, as it supports both soft and hard clustering through the tuning of a fuzziness parameter, and it naturally accommodates multivariate time series data of mixed types. Through a simulation study, we evaluate the ability of the proposed model to accurately estimate the true latent-state distribution, demonstrating that it outperforms competing approaches under high cluster assignment uncertainty. We further demonstrate its utility on two empirical applications: first, by automatically identifying co-orbital regimes in the three-body problem, a novel application with important implications for understanding asteroid behavior and designing interplanetary mission trajectories; and second, on a financial dataset of five assets representing distinct market sectors (equities, bonds, foreign exchange, cryptocurrencies, and utilities), where the model accurately tracks both bull and bear market phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kairos: Towards Adaptive and Generalizable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25826v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.

| **[BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05215v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works propose complex multi-modal models that handle both time series and language, ultimately claiming high performance on complex tasks like time series reasoning and cross-modal question-answering. However, they skip evaluations of simple and important foundational tasks, which complex models should reliably master. They also lack direct, head-to-head comparisons with other popular approaches. So we ask a simple question: Can recent models even produce generic visual descriptions of time series data? In response, we propose three new tasks, posing that successful multi-modal models should be able to recognize, differentiate, and generate language descriptions of time series. We then create BEDTime, the first benchmark dataset to assess models on each task, comprising four datasets reformatted for these tasks across multiple modalities. Using BEDTime, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models, and find that (1) surprisingly, dedicated time series foundation models severely underperform, despite being designed for similar tasks, (2) vision-language models are quite capable, (3) language-only methods perform worst, despite many lauding their potential, and (4) all approaches are clearly fragile to a range of realistic robustness tests, indicating avenues for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25696v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper, we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM. Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Does Multimodality Lead to Better Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21611v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our study offers a rigorous, quantitative foundation for understanding when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and reveals that its benefits are neither universal nor always aligned with intuition.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on Joint Embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models - NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</p></details> |  |

Genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a stochastic way to identify the structural changes: a population of candidate models evolves via selection, crossover, and mutation operators until it converges on one changepoint model that balances the goodness-of-fit with parsimony. The R package changepointGA encodes each candidate model as an integer chromosome vector and supports both the basic single-population model GA and the island model GA. Parallel computing is implemented on multi-core hardware to further accelerate computation. Users may supply custom fitness functions or genetic operators, while a user-friendly wrapper streamlines routine analyses. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our package runs significantly faster than binary-encoded GA alternatives. Additionally, this package can simultaneously locate changepoints and estimate their effects, as well as other model parameters and any integer-valued hyperparameters. Applications to array-based comparative genomic hybridization data and a century-long temperature series further highlight the package's value in biological and climate research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce reddemcee, an Adaptive Parallel Tempering Ensemble Sampler, aiming to close this gap by simultaneously presenting next-generation automated temperature-ladder adaptation techniques and robust, low-bias evidence estimators. reddemcee couples an affine-invariant stretch move with five interchangeable ladder-adaptation objectives, Uniform Swap Acceptance Rate, Swap Mean Distance, Gaussian-Area Overlap, Small Gaussian Gap, and Equalised Thermodynamic Length, implemented through a common differential update rule. Three evidence estimators are provided: Curvature-aware Thermodynamic Integration (TI+), Geometric-Bridge Stepping Stones (SS+), and a novel Hybrid algorithm that blends both approaches (H+). Performance and accuracy are benchmarked on n-dimensional Gaussian Shells, Gaussian Egg-box, Rosenbrock Functions, and exoplanet radial-velocity time-series of HD 20794. Across Shells up to 15 dimensions, reddemcee presents roughly 7 times the effective sampling speed of the best dynamic nested sampling configuration. The TI+, SS+ and H+ estimators recover estimates under 3 percent error and supply realistic uncertainties with as few as six temperatures. In the HD 20794 case study, reddemcee reproduces literature model rankings and yields tighter yet consistent planetary parameters compared with dynesty, with evidence errors that track run-to-run dispersion. By unifying fast ladder adaptation with reliable evidence estimators, reddemcee delivers strong throughput and accurate evidence estimates, often matching, and occasionally surpassing, dynamic nested sampling, while preserving the rich posterior information which makes MCMC indispensable for modern Bayesian inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: R...</summary><p>v2: Revised after referee comments; resubmitted to A&A on 24 Sep 2025</p></details> |
| **[Double Machine Learning Based Structure Identification from Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06012v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the causes of time-series data is a fundamental task in many applications, spanning from finance to earth sciences or bio-medical applications. Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications or even contain cycles. To address these challenges, we propose a new double machine learning based method for structure identification from temporal data (DR-SIT). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles, and they may even be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method.

| **[TimeOmni-1: Incentivizing Complex Reasoning with Time Series in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24803v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSAT-HD: Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer with Hybrid Decomposition for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24800v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather, traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner, enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks. Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in multimodal forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |

Switching diffusion models extend ordinary diffusions by allowing for jumps in instantaneous drift and volatility. The jumps are driven by a latent, continuous time Markov switching process. We address the problem through an MCMC and an MCEM algorithm that target the exact posterior of diffusion parameters and the latent regime process. The algorithms are exact in the sense that they target the correct posterior distribution of the continuous model, so that the errors are due to Monte Carlo only. We illustrate the method on numerical examples, including an empirical analysis of the method's scalability in the length of the time series, and find that it is comparable in computational cost with discrete approximations while avoiding their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Autoregressive Online Change-Point Detection with Time-Varying Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16376v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change points in real-world systems mark significant regime shifts in system dynamics, possibly triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation</p></details> |

While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from time-series data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data. We demonstrate our approach on three test cases: the Lorenz system transitioning from non-chaotic to chaotic behaviour, the R\"ossler system moving from chaos to period doubling, and a predator-prey model exhibiting collapse via a global bifurcation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added two additional test cases; major restructuring of text accordingly</p></details> |

Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series prediction.

Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy. Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

| **[AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network inference via process motifs for lagged correlation in linear stochastic processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08871v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.</p></details> | 28 pages, 17 figures |
| **[MAESTRO : Adaptive Sparse Attention and Robust Learning for Multimodal Dynamic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25278v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, the first benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; we release our code publicly at https://github.com/UnifiedTSAI/Time-HD-Lib</p></details> |
| **[Weight-Space Linear Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01153v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful model that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes its hidden state as the weights and biases of a distinct auxiliary neural network, and uses input differences to drive its recurrence. This brain-inspired formulation enables efficient gradient-free adaptation of the auxiliary network at test-time, in-context learning abilities, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, featuring in the top three in 5 out of 6 real-world challenging datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, multivariate time series forecasting, and dynamical system reconstruction demonstrate its expressiveness and generalisation capabilities. Remarkably, a physics-informed variant of our model outperforms the next best model by more than 10x. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 20 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo Flow Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability. We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.</p></details> | Under Review |

Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (OHSVGP), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SVGP inducing variables to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate OHSVGP with online prediction for 1D time series, continual learning in discriminative GP model for data with multidimensional inputs, and deep generative modeling with sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder, showing that it outperforms existing online GP methods in terms of predictive performance, long-term memory preservation, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models (hence, CSDM): First, compress the dataset into a latent space (from an ambient space), and train a diffusion model in the latent space; next, apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space for decoding back to the original space; and the goal is to facilitate the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under certain sparsity assumptions on data, our proposed approach achieves provably faster convergence, via combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. It also sheds light on the best choice of the latent space dimension. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we run numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including handwritten digits, medical and climate images, and financial time series for stress testing.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods rely heavily on domain feature extraction, which breaks the end-to-end training pipeline and limits the model's ability to learn expressive representations from the raw orderbook. Moreover, these methods often require training separate models for different quantiles, further violating the end-to-end principle and introducing the quantile crossing issue. Recent advances in time-series models have demonstrated promising performance in general forecasting tasks. However, these models lack inductive biases arising from buy-sell interactions and are thus overparameterized. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end probabilistic model called OrderFusion, which produces interaction-aware representations of buy-sell dynamics, hierarchically estimates multiple quantiles, and remains parameter-efficient with only 4,872 parameters. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on price indices (ID1, ID2, and ID3) using three years of orderbook in high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrderFusion consistently outperforms multiple competitive baselines across markets, and ablation studies highlight the contribution of its individual components.

While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

| **[Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable, domain-aligned explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.19193</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid DNN Transformer AE Framework for Corporate Tax Risk Supervision and Risk Level Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23862v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tax risk supervision has become a critical component of modern financial governance, as irregular tax behaviors and hidden compliance risks pose significant challenges to regulatory authorities and enterprises alike. Traditional rule-based methods often struggle to capture complex and dynamic tax-related anomalies in large-scale enterprise data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework (DNN-Transformer-Autoencoder) for corporate tax risk supervision and risk level assessment. The framework integrates three complementary modules: a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for modeling static enterprise attributes, a Transformer-based architecture for capturing long-term dependencies in historical financial time series, and an Autoencoder (AE) for unsupervised detection of anomalous tax behaviors. The outputs of these modules are fused to generate a comprehensive risk score, which is further mapped into discrete risk levels (high, medium, low). Experimental evaluations on a real-world enterprise tax dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving an accuracy of 0.91 and a Macro F1-score of 0.88. These results indicate that the hybrid model not only improves classification performance but also enhances interpretability and applicability in practical tax regulation scenarios. This study provides both methodological innovation and regulatory implications for intelligent tax risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Time Series Foundation Model Transferability via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23695v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23671v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Network with Lead-Lag Structures for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23668v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-like Content Analysis for Generative AI with Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18236v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of generative AI has transformed content creation, communication, and human development. However, this technology raises profound concerns in high-stakes domains, demanding rigorous methods to analyze and evaluate AI-generated content. While existing analytic methods often treat images as indivisible wholes, real-world AI failures generally manifest as specific visual patterns that can evade holistic detection and suit more granular and decomposed analysis. Here we introduce a content analysis tool, Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE), which decompose images into interpretable visual patterns with natural language descriptions. Utilizing interpretability modules and large multimodal models, LanSE can automatically identify visual patterns within data modalities. Our method discovers more than 5,000 visual patterns with 93\% human agreement, provides decomposed evaluation outperforming existing methods, establishes the first systematic evaluation of physical plausibility, and extends to medical imaging settings. Our method's capability to extract language-grounded patterns can be naturally adapted to numerous fields, including biology and geography, as well as other data modalities such as protein structures and time series, thereby advancing content analysis for generative AI.</p></details> | 45 pages, 32 figures |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RainfallBench-A710.</p></details> | 11 pages,8 figures |
| **[Characteristic Root Analysis and Regularization for Linear Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23597v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel, Trend and Periodic-Wise Representation Learning for Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23583v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Downsampling-based methods for time series forecasting have attracted increasing attention due to their superiority in capturing sequence trends. However, this approaches mainly capture dependencies within subsequences but neglect inter-subsequence and inter-channel interactions, which limits forecasting accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose CTPNet, a novel framework that explicitly learns representations from three perspectives: i) inter-channel dependencies, captured by a temporal query-based multi-head attention mechanism; ii) intra-subsequence dependencies, modeled via a Transformer to characterize trend variations; and iii) inter-subsequence dependencies, extracted by reusing the encoder with residual connections to capture global periodic patterns. By jointly integrating these levels, proposed method provides a more holistic representation of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17942v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics.

Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.</p></details> | Under submission |

To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Many caregivers and self-trackers want to use these data to help a specific person change their behavior to achieve desired health outcomes. Ideally, this involves discerning possible causes from correlations using that person's own observational time series data. In this paper, we estimate within-individual average treatment effects of physical activity on sleep duration, and vice-versa. We introduce the model twin randomization (MoTR; "motor") method for analyzing an individual's intensive longitudinal data. Formally, MoTR is an application of the g-formula (i.e., standardization, back-door adjustment) under serial interference. It estimates stable recurring individual treatment effects, as is done in n-of-1 trials and single case experimental designs. We compare our approach to standard methods (with possible confounding) to show how to use causal inference to make better personalized recommendations for health behavior change, and analyze up to almost eight years of the authors' own Fitbit steps and sleep data.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages (34 main text, 11 appendix); 4 figures (1 main text, 3 appendix); 6 tables (5 main text, 1 appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust Real-World Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Unified Framework for Dependency, Asynchrony, and Missingness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08660v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.</p></details> | 31 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Deep Time Series Models: A Comprehensive Survey and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13278v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series, characterized by a sequence of data points organized in a discrete-time order, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. Unlike other data modalities, time series present unique challenges due to their intricate and dynamic nature, including the entanglement of nonlinear patterns and time-variant trends. Analyzing such data is of great significance in practical applications and has been extensively studied for centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to contemporary deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks. TSLib implements 30 prominent models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 13 advanced deep time series models across diverse tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, providing insights for research and adoption of deep time series models.

| **[Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23074v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting, progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards. However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

Most methods for imputation ignore label information pertaining to the time series even if that information exists. In this paper, we provide a framework for missing data imputation in the context of time series classification, where each time series is associated with a categorical label. We define a means of imputing missing values conditional upon labels, the method being guided by powerful, existing supervised models designed for high accuracy in this task. From each model, we extract a tree-based proximity measure from which imputation can be applied. We show that imputation using this method generally provides richer information leading to higher classification accuracies, despite the imputed values differing from the true values.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, one figure.

| **[Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent population states, termed compartmental prototypes. It discovers a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from surveillance data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE combines self-supervised pre-training objectives with lightweight epidemic-aware regularizers that align the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases and 50+ regions, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded.</p></details> | version 2.0 |

Building on the classical concept of cointegration, we introduce a more flexible notion, called stability space, aimed at capturing stationary components in settings where traditional assumptions may not hold. Based on the dimensionality reduction techniques of Partial Least Squares and Principal Component Analysis, we proposed two non-parametric procedures for estimating such a space and a targeted selection of components that prioritise stationarity. We compare these alternatives with the parametric Johansen procedure when possible. Through simulations and real-data applications, we evaluated the performance of these methodologies across various scenarios, including high-dimensional configurations where regularisation techniques are explored, considering a sparse version of the Principal Component Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Temporal Saliency for Time Series Forecasting with Cross-Scale Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22839v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.</p></details> |  |

Existing automatic methods typically extract features from complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets (ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG image dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |

Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce TAMMs, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026).

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting the future development in quality and value of professional football players](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07528v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22284v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

| **[Unlocking the Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Task-Aware Time Series Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22279v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |

To accommodate heavy tails, we adopt an element-wise truncation step followed by a two-stage estimation procedure for estimating the latent factors and the VAR parameter matrices. Assuming the existence of the $(2 + 2\epsilon)$-th moment only for some $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$, we derive the rates of estimation that make explicit the effect of heavy tails through $\epsilon$. Simulation studies and an application in macroeconomics demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed estimators.</p></details> |  |

Most existing time series models are designed to accommodate simple periodically correlated components and tend to be sensitive to over-parameterization and optimization issues and are also unable to model complex PC components patterns in a time series. Frequency separation techniques can be used to maintain the correlation structure of each specific PC component, whereas Bayesian techniques can combine new and existing prior information to update beliefs about these components. This study introduces a method to combine the frequency separation techniques and Bayesian techniques to forecast PC and MPC time series data in a two stage form which is expected to show the new method's suitability in modeling MPC components compared to classical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial generalization mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that ERIS achieves a statistically significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, consistently securing the top performance rank.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements.

| **[Finetuning Large Language Model as an Effective Symbolic Regressor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09897v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language Models, (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treat complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises over 148,000 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference. Further, to ensure a more comprehensive and fair evaluation, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish Symbolic-R1, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental results validate Symbolic-R1 as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 10.3% in form-level consistency score.</p></details> |  |

These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3 bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM.

Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.</p></details> |  |

These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods can be categorized into symbolic and neural models. Symbolic models, while precise, struggle with substructure heterogeneity and sparsity, whereas neural models, although effective, generally lack interpretability and cannot handle uncertainty. We propose NeuSymEA, a unified neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that combines the strengths of both methods to fully exploit the cross-KG structural pattern for robust entity alignment. NeuSymEA models the joint probability of all possible pairs' truth scores in a Markov random field, regulated by a set of rules, and optimizes it with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, a neural model parameterizes the truth score distributions and infers missing alignments. In the M-step, the rule weights are updated based on the observed and inferred alignments, handling uncertainty. We introduce an efficient symbolic inference engine driven by logic deduction, enabling reasoning with extended rule lengths. NeuSymEA achieves a significant 7.6\% hit@1 improvement on $\text{DBP15K}_{\text{ZH-EN}}$ compared with strong baselines and demonstrates robustness in low-resource settings, achieving 73.7\% hit@1 accuracy on $\text{DBP15K}_{\text{FR-EN}}$ with only 1\% pairs as seed alignments.

However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model (LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed. The results indicate that SIL significantly enhances policy transparency while maintaining strong performance across varied driving conditions. These findings highlight the potential of integrating ILP into imitation learning to promote safer and more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Time-Shifted Token Scheduling for Symbolic Music Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23749v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: T...</summary><p>v2: Two TMLR revision rounds addressing reviewer feedback.

While symbolic music has been widely used in generation tasks, LLM capabilities in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose ABC-Eval, the first open-source benchmark dedicated to the understanding and instruction-following capabilities in text-based ABC notation scores. It comprises 1,086 test samples spanning 10 sub-tasks, covering scenarios from basic musical syntax comprehension to complex sequence-level reasoning. Such a diverse scope poses substantial challenges to models' ability to handle symbolic music tasks. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs on ABC-Eval, and the results reveal notable limitations in existing models' symbolic music processing capabilities. Furthermore, the consistent performance of individual baselines across different sub-tasks supports the reliability of our benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

Effective detection and elimination of these vulnerabilities during the testing phase are essential. Current methods, such as fuzzing, are widely used for this purpose. While fuzzing is efficient in identifying a broad range of bugs and vulnerabilities by using random mutations or generations, it does not guarantee correctness or absence of vulnerabilities. Therefore, non-random methods are preferable for ensuring the safety and security of critical infrastructure and control systems. This paper presents a vulnerability detection approach based on symbolic execution and control flow graph analysis to identify various types of software weaknesses. Our approach employs a divide-and-conquer algorithm to eliminate irrelevant program information, thus accelerating the process and enabling the analysis of larger programs compared to traditional symbolic execution and model checking methods.</p></details> |  |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present \textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\% accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.</p></details> |  |

Compared to other testing methods such as fuzzing, Symbolic Execution has the advantage of providing formal guarantees about the program. However, despite advances in performance in recent years, Symbolic Execution is too slow to be applied to real-world software. This is primarily caused by the \emph{path explosion problem} as well as by the computational complexity of SMT solving. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer approach for symbolic execution by executing individual slices and later combining the side effects. This way, the overall problem size is kept small, reducing the impact of computational complexity on large problems.</p></details> |  |

However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In quantitative disciplines concepts are typically formulated as equations. Hence, in order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. Computationally, this framework is based on finding a symbolic expression whose normalized gradients match the normalized gradients of a specific neuron with respect to the input variables. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major Revision, new code for experiments, reflect author contributions</p></details> |

To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Approaches using generative methods, particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan. We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial and complete symbolic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Beyond Formula Complexity: Effective Information Criterion Improves Performance and Interpretability for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21780v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system. We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts' preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Symbolic Computation via Hash Consing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20534v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation, simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster, function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100 times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in AI-driven pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the distributed camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. In this position paper, I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both distributed/continuous/fuzzy and symbolic/discrete/categorical-like representations and processing; 2) models trained on language make use of this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it makes them particularly interesting for the study of language.

Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

Central to this progress is uncovering scientific laws from experimental data through symbolic regression. However, existing approaches are dominated by heuristic algorithms or data-hungry black-box methods, which often demand low-noise settings and lack principled uncertainty quantification. Motivated by interpretable Statistical Artificial Intelligence, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for symbolic regression that represents scientific laws as ensembles of tree-structured symbolic expressions endowed with a regularized tree prior. This coherent probabilistic formulation enables full posterior inference via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, yielding a balance between predictive accuracy and structural parsimony. To guide symbolic model selection, we develop a marginal posterior-based criterion adhering to the Occam's window principle and further quantify structural fidelity to ground truth through a tailored expression-distance metric. On the theoretical front, we establish near-minimax rate of Bayesian posterior concentration, providing the first rigorous guarantee in context of symbolic regression. Empirical evaluation demonstrates robust performance of our proposed methodology against state-of-the-art competing modules on a simulated example, a suite of canonical Feynman equations, and single-atom catalysis dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance where significant data shifting exists.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, IEEE-EMBS BSN 2025</p></details> |

Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction, $\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation, and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and deep learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</p></details> |  |

While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches, which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling, hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However, these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%, especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step compositional reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Symbol Detection in Inter-Symbol Interference Channels using Expectation Propagation with Channel Shortening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17735v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative message passing detection based on expectation propagation(EP) has demonstrated near-optimum performance in many signal processing and communication scenarios. The method remains feasible even for channel impulse responses (CIRs), where the optimal Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) detector is infeasible. However, significant performance degradation occurs for channels with strong inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the initial linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimate is inaccurate. We propose an EP-based detector that operates in a transformed signal space obtained by channel shortening. Specifically, instead of the conventional approach that iterates between an LMMSE estimator and a non-linear symbol-wise demapper, the proposed method iterates between a linear channel shortening filter-based estimator and a nonlinear BCJR detector with reduced memory compared to the actual channel. Additionally, we propose a deliberate mismatch between the initialized messages and the initialized covariance used in the linear estimator in the first iteration for faster convergence. The proposed approach is evaluated for the well-known Proakis-C ISI channel and for CIRs from a wireless measurement campaign. We demonstrate improvements of up to 6dB at 2 bits per channel use and an improved performance-complexity trade-off over conventional EP-based detection.</p></details> | Submitted to ICASSP |

However, generating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving performance nuances. The proposed model has been evaluated using the Maestro dataset and has demonstrated improvements in generating coherent and diverse music, characterized by both structural consistency and expressive variation. The project demos and the generated music samples can be accessed through the link: https://perceivers.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barwise Section Boundary Detection in Symbolic Music Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16566v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for Music Structure Analysis (MSA) focus primarily on audio data. While symbolic music can be synthesized into audio and analyzed using existing MSA techniques, such an approach does not exploit symbolic music's rich explicit representation of pitch, timing, and instrumentation. A key subproblem of MSA is section boundary detection-determining whether a given point in time marks the transition between musical sections. In this paper, we study automatic section boundary detection for symbolic music. First, we introduce a human-annotated MIDI dataset for section boundary detection, consisting of metadata from 6134 MIDI files that we manually curated from the Lakh MIDI dataset. Second, we train a deep learning model to classify the presence of section boundaries within a fixed-length musical window. Our data representation involves a novel encoding scheme based on synthesized overtones to encode arbitrary MIDI instrumentations into 3-channel piano rolls. Our model achieves an F1 score of 0.77, improving over the analogous audio-based supervised learning approach and the unsupervised block-matching segmentation (CBM) audio approach by 0.22 and 0.31, respectively. We release our dataset, code, and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Powered Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13452v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, offering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem provers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently approximate by nature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy and scale of analysis in real-world applications. Such issues often necessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token limits, but this requires enterprise-grade hardware (GPUs) and thus limits accessibility for many users. In this paper, we propose LLM-based symbolic execution -- a novel approach that enhances LLM inference via a path-based decomposition of the program analysis tasks into smaller (more tractable) subtasks. The core idea is to generalize path constraints using a generic code-based representation that the LLM can directly reason over, and without translation into another (less-expressive) formal language. We implement our approach in the form of AutoBug, an LLM-based symbolic execution engine that is lightweight and language-agnostic, making it a practical tool for analyzing code that is challenging for traditional approaches. We show that AutoBug can improve both the accuracy and scale of LLM-based program analysis, especially for smaller LLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, published in "Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications" (OOPSLA), 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs, and typically rely on additional features (e.g., primitive types or graphical layers) to improve performance. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with only coordinate attributes, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique that combines weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale dataset comprising 45 finely annotated floorplans, each covering approximately 1,000 $m^2$, significantly larger than prior benchmarks. LS-CAD will be publicly released to support future research. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD demonstrate that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also showcase its practical value by enabling automated parametric 3D interior reconstruction directly from raw CAD inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16pag...</summary><p>16pages, 14 figures, Project web-page: https://dgeneai.github.io/cadspotting-pages/</p></details> |

Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning. Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across five real-world conditions.

| **[Active Learning of Symbolic Mealy Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14694v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\Lambda^*_M$-an active learning algorithm that learns symbolic Mealy automata, which support infinite input alphabets and multiple output characters. Each of these two features has been addressed separately in prior work. Combining these two features poses a challenge in learning the outputs corresponding to potentially infinite sets of input characters at each state. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of essential input characters, a finite set of input characters that is sufficient for learning the output function of a symbolic Mealy automaton. $\Lambda^*_M$ maintains an underapproximation of the essential input characters and refines this set during learning. We prove that $\Lambda^*_M$ terminates under certain assumptions. Moreover, we provide upper and lower bounds for the query complexity. Their similarity suggests the tightness of the bounds. We empirically demonstrate that $\Lambda^*_M$ is i) efficient regarding the number of queries on practical benchmarks and ii) scalable according to evaluations with randomly generated benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICTAC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Chameleon: Integrated Sensing and Communication with Sub-Symbol Beam Switching in mmWave Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14628v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-generation cellular networks are envisioned to integrate sensing capabilities with communication, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where beamforming using large-scale antenna arrays enables directional signal transmissions for improved spatial multiplexing. In current 5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for communication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In this paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly switches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each beamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while maintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement Chameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments in open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with a sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon employs a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\mu}s, therefore producing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine learning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of 0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\deg} (angle), and material classification with 99.0% accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main), 9+6 pages</p></details> |
| **[Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Vector Symbolic Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. In this study, we propose a vector symbolic architecture-based OGM system (VSA-OGM) that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while reducing latency by approximately 45x and memory by 400x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 5.5x. Moreover, we achieve up to 6x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training. This work demonstrates the potential of vector symbolic architectures as a practical foundation for real-time probabilistic mapping in autonomous systems operating under strict computational and latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and automated smart contract auditing.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FROM 2025, arXiv:2509.11877</p></details> |
| **[Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08171v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on coding tasks such as generation, completion and repair, but their ability to handle complex symbolic reasoning over code still remains underexplored. We introduce the task of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis, which requires inferring the symbolic constraints that characterise worst-case program executions; these constraints can be solved to obtain inputs that expose performance bottlenecks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities in software systems. We show that even state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) struggle when applied directly on this task. To address this challenge, we propose WARP, an innovative neurosymbolic approach that computes worst-case constraints on smaller concrete input sizes using existing program analysis tools, and then leverages LLMs to generalise these constraints to larger input sizes. Concretely, WARP comprises: (1) an incremental strategy for LLM-based worst-case reasoning, (2) a solver-aligned neurosymbolic framework that integrates reinforcement learning with SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving, and (3) a curated dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that WARP consistently improves performance on worst-case constraint reasoning. Leveraging the curated constraint dataset, we use reinforcement learning to fine-tune a model, WARP-1.0-3B, which significantly outperforms size-matched and even larger baselines. These results demonstrate that incremental constraint reasoning enhances LLMs' ability to handle symbolic reasoning and highlight the potential for deeper integration between neural learning and formal methods in rigorous program analysis.</p></details> |  |

The error-correcting capability of the symbol-pair code is determined by its minimum symbol-pair distance. For such codes, the larger the minimum symbol-pair distance, the better. It is a challenging task to construct symbol-pair codes with optimal parameters, especially, maximum-distance-separable (MDS) symbol-pair codes. In this paper, the permutation equivalence codes of matrix-product codes with underlying matrices of orders $3$ and $4$ are used to extend the minimum symbol-pair distance, four new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes and a new class of AMDS symbol-pair codes are derived.</p></details> | 24 pages,1 table |

We argue that a key ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding true causal inference.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |

Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[A unit-based symbolic execution method for detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04258v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory corruption is a serious class of software vulnerabilities, which requires careful attention to be detected and removed from applications before getting exploited and harming the system users. Symbolic execution is a well-known method for analyzing programs and detecting various vulnerabilities, e.g., memory corruption. Although this method is sound and complete in theory, it faces some challenges, such as path explosion, when applied to real-world complex programs. In this paper, we present a method for improving the efficiency of symbolic execution and detecting four classes of memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes, i.e., heap-based buffer overflow, stack-based buffer overflow, use-after-free, and double-free. We perform symbolic execution only on test units rather than the whole program to lower the chance of path explosion. In our method, test units are considered parts of the program's code, which might contain vulnerable statements and are statically identified based on the specifications of memory corruption vulnerabilities. Then, each test unit is symbolically executed to calculate path and vulnerability constraints of each statement of the unit, which determine the conditions on unit input data for executing that statement or activating vulnerabilities in it, respectively. Solving these constraints gives us input values for the test unit, which execute the desired statements and reveal vulnerabilities in them. Finally, we use machine learning to approximate the correlation between system and unit input data. Thereby, we generate system inputs that enter the program, reach vulnerable instructions in the desired test unit, and reveal vulnerabilities in them. This method is implemented as a plugin for angr framework and evaluated using a group of benchmark programs. The experiments show its superiority over similar tools in accuracy and performance.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising interface for translating complex and ambiguous natural language instructions into actionable plans. However, their probabilistic and opaque nature often leads to logically inconsistent or infeasible outputs. To address these limitations, recent frameworks combine LLMs with symbolic planners by first generating action models (Planning Domain Definition Language) and then applying heuristic search. Although promising, such systems still suffer from representation redundancy and exponential search complexity, often resulting in inefficient or overly long plans. To improve planning efficiency and effectiveness, we propose PLAHX (Planning from Language using Abstraction and Heuristic eXploration), a two-stage LLM-symbolic planning framework that integrates abstract symbolic representations with meta-heuristic subspace search in a parallel and iterative fashion. Rather than relying on verbose LLM-generated domain models, we introduce a minimalist symbolic abstraction pipeline that preserves semantic fidelity while eliminating redundancy. Our approach redefines LLM-symbolic planning not by making LLMs smarter, but by reducing the symbolic search space adaptively. Empirical results across four challenging domains, including block stacking and robotic mobile grasping, show that our approach improves the success rate by 21.47% on average, while reducing token consumption by 13% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harmful Prompt Laundering: Jailbreaking LLMs with Abductive Styles and Symbolic Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10931v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

This work establishes the Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Symbolic Finite Transducers: Formalization and Applications to String Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07203v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite Automata (FAs) are fundamental components in the domains of programming languages. For instance, regular expressions, which are pivotal in languages such as JavaScript and Python, are frequently implemented using FAs. Finite Transducers (FTs) extend the capabilities of FAs by enabling the transformation of input strings into output strings, thereby providing a more expressive framework for operations that encompass both recognition and transformation. Despite the various formalizations of FAs in proof assistants such as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, these formalizations often fall short in terms of applicability to real-world scenarios. A more pragmatic approach involves the formalization of symbolic FAs and FTs, where transition labels are symbolic and potentially infinite. While the formalization of symbolic FAs has been explored in the work of CertiStr, the formalization of symbolic FTs in interactive proof assistants remains largely unexplored due to the increased complexity challenges. In this paper, we aim to formalize symbolic FTs within the Isabelle/HOL framework. This formalization is refinement-based and is designed to be extensible with various symbolic representations of transition labels. To assess its performance, we applied the formalized symbolic FTs to an SMT string solver for modeling replacement operations. The experimental results indicate that the formalized symbolic transducer can efficiently and effectively solve string constraints with replacement operations.</p></details> | Conference |

Symbolic regression searches for mathematical equations that best fit a given dataset and is commonly solved with genetic programming approaches. We show that by using deep learning techniques, more specific KANs, and combining them with simplification strategies such as translational symmetries and separabilities, we are able to recover ground-truth equations of the Feynman Symbolic Regression for Scientific Discovery (SRSD) dataset. Additionally, we show that by combining the proposed framework with neural controlled differential equations, we are able to model the dynamics of an in-silico bioprocess system precisely, opening the door for the dynamic modeling of other engineering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering physical laws with parallel symbolic enumeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04405v4)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression plays a crucial role in modern scientific research thanks to its capability of discovering concise and interpretable mathematical expressions from data. A key challenge lies in the search for parsimonious and generalizable mathematical formulas, in an infinite search space, while intending to fit the training data. Existing algorithms have faced a critical bottleneck of accuracy and efficiency over a decade when handling problems of complexity, which essentially hinders the pace of applying symbolic regression for scientific exploration across interdisciplinary domains. To this end, we introduce parallel symbolic enumeration (PSE) to efficiently distill generic mathematical expressions from limited data. Experiments show that PSE achieves higher accuracy and faster computation compared to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms across over 200 synthetic and experimental problem sets (e.g., improving the recovery accuracy by up to 99% and reducing runtime by an order of magnitude). PSE represents an advance in accurate and efficient data-driven discovery of symbolic, interpretable models (e.g., underlying physical laws), and improves the scalability of symbolic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoStub: Genetic Programming-Based Stub Creation for Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08524v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.</p></details> | 2025 HUMIES finalist |
| **[Symbolic regression via MDLformer-guided search: from minimizing prediction error to minimizing description length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03753v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression, a task discovering the formula best fitting the given data, is typically based on the heuristical search. These methods usually update candidate formulas to obtain new ones with lower prediction errors iteratively. However, since formulas with similar function shapes may have completely different symbolic forms, the prediction error does not decrease monotonously as the search approaches the target formula, causing the low recovery rate of existing methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel search objective based on the minimum description length, which reflects the distance from the target and decreases monotonically as the search approaches the correct form of the target formula. To estimate the minimum description length of any input data, we design a neural network, MDLformer, which enables robust and scalable estimation through large-scale training. With the MDLformer's output as the search objective, we implement a symbolic regression method, SR4MDL, that can effectively recover the correct mathematical form of the formula. Extensive experiments illustrate its excellent performance in recovering formulas from data. Our method successfully recovers around 50 formulas across two benchmark datasets comprising 133 problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 43.92%. Experiments on 122 unseen black-box problems further demonstrate its generalization performance. We release our code at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SR4MDL .</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Constraints in Polyhedral Enclosure and Tetrahedral Decomposition in Genus-0 Polyhedra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18222v4)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for determining whether a given set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges for internally decomposed polyhedra with the minimal number of added internal edges. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Symbolic Triggers of Hallucination in Gemma Models Across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09715v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem. However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B, reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities (ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets. These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models, pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such inputs--regardless of their scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Language Model to Solve the Symbolic Multi-Step Reasoning Problem from the Perspective of Buffer Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15302v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have consistently struggled with complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving. Investigating the internal reasoning mechanisms of these models can help us design better model architectures and training strategies, ultimately enhancing their reasoning capability. In this study, we constructed a symbolic multi-step reasoning task to investigate the information propagation mechanisms in Transformer models when solving the task through direct answering and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We introduced the concept of buffer mechanism: the model stores various information in distinct buffers and selectively extracts it through the query-key matrix. We proposed a random matrix-based algorithm to enhance the model's reasoning ability. This algorithm introduces only 132 trainable parameters, yet leads to significant performance improvements on 7 multi-step reasoning datasets, including PrOntoQA, LogicAsker, and LogicInference. These findings provide new insights into understanding the large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v6)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Combining the reasoning capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve, lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper, we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog}, \textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this problem in novel ways.</p></details> |  |

Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning 2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps, computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.</p></details> |  |

A family of codes correcting a transposition at an arbitrary location is described and proved to have asymptotically optimal redundancy. Additionally, an improved construction is given over a binary alphabet. Bounds on the cardinality of codes correcting $ t = \textrm{const} $ transpositions are obtained. A lower bound on the achievable asymptotic rate of optimal codes correcting $ t = \tau n $ transpositions is derived. Finally, a construction of codes correcting all possible patterns of transpositions is presented, and the corresponding lower bound on the zero-error capacity of the $ q $-ary transposition channel is stated.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment, adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures, while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Methods for the Cross-Level Verification of SystemC Peripherals with Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05504v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Prototypes (VPs) are important tools in modern hardware development. At high abstractions, they are often implemented in SystemC and offer early analysis of increasingly complex designs. These complex designs often combine one or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in hardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a well-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction levels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be seamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in the SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the SystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely, and would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems like peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a versatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC kernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our extensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different levels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated for (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In comparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel and peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level Modelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling cross-level verification with symbolic execution.</p></details> |  |

MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |

We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (32 pages, 12 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/SGP-Gen/)</p></details> |

However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |

A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve performance.</p></details> |  |

This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve these improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.</p></details> |  |

We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings, thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably, our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios. Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy) substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ANSyA 2025: 1st International Workshop on Advanced Neuro-Symbolic Applications</p></details> |

To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[ViSymRe: Vision-guided Multimodal Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11139v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting simple mathematical expression from an observational dataset to describe complex natural phenomena is one of the core objectives of artificial intelligence (AI). This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). Traditional SR models are based on genetic programming (GP) or reinforcement learning (RL), facing well-known challenges, such as low efficiency and overfitting. Recent studies have integrated SR with large language models (LLMs), enabling fast zero-shot inference by learning mappings from millions of dataset-expression pairs. However, since the input and output are inherently different modalities, such models often struggle to converge effectively. In this paper, we introduce ViSymRe, a vision-guided multimodal SR model that incorporates the third resource, expression graph, to bridge the modality gap. Different from traditional multimodal models, ViSymRe is trained to extract vision, termed virtual vision, from datasets, without relying on the global availability of expression graphs, which addresses the essential challenge of visual SR, i.e., expression graphs are not available during inference. Evaluation results on multiple mainstream benchmarks show that ViSymRe achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art dataset-only baselines. The expressions predicted by ViSymRe not only fit the dataset well but are also simple and structurally accurate, goals that SR models strive to achieve.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.</p></details> |  |

| **[$p$-less Sampling: A Robust Hyperparameter-Free Approach for LLM Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23234v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26041v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Aristotle: Mastering Logical Reasoning with A Logic-Complete Decompose-Search-Resolve Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16953v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://llm-symbol.github.io/Aristotle/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[MuSLR: Multimodal Symbolic Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25851v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</p></details> |  |
