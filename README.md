| **[Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06253v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing for Combinatorial Optimization: A Benchmarking Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06201v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) has the potential to significantly improve solution quality and reduce time complexity in solving combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical optimization methods. However, due to the limited number of qubits and their connectivity, the QA hardware did not show such an advantage over classical methods in past benchmarking studies. Recent advancements in QA with more than 5,000 qubits, enhanced qubit connectivity, and the hybrid architecture promise to realize the quantum advantage. Here, we use a quantum annealer with state-of-the-art techniques and benchmark its performance against classical solvers. To compare their performance, we solve over 50 optimization problem instances represented by large and dense Hamiltonian matrices using quantum and classical solvers. The results demonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum solver has higher accuracy (~0.013%) and a significantly faster problem-solving time (~6,561x) than the best classical solver. Our results highlight the advantages of leveraging QA over classical counterparts, particularly in hybrid configurations, for achieving high accuracy and substantially reduced problem solving time in large-scale real-world optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06126v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions, which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within 1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum-Inspired Solvers: A Preliminary Study on the Weighted Max-Cut Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05989v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization is essential across numerous disciplines. Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |
| **[Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms can surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2" target="_blank">[King et al., Nature (2023)]</a> in solving certain hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results raise the bar for a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Low-Rank Extragradient Methods for Scalable Semidefinite Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09081v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider several classes of highly important semidefinite optimization problems that involve both a convex objective function (smooth or nonsmooth) and additional linear or nonlinear smooth and convex constraints, which are ubiquitous in statistics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and other domains. We focus on high-dimensional and plausible settings in which the problem admits a low-rank solution which also satisfies a low-rank complementarity condition. We provide several theoretical results proving that, under these circumstances, the well-known Extragradient method, when initialized in the proximity of an optimal primal-dual solution, converges to a solution of the constrained optimization problem with its standard convergence rates guarantees, using only low-rank singular value decompositions (SVD) to project onto the positive semidefinite cone, as opposed to computationally-prohibitive full-rank SVDs required in worst-case. Our approach is supported by numerical experiments conducted with a dataset of Max-Cut instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects an error in the previous version, as well as in the short version published in \textit{Operations Research Letters} \cite{garber2025low}: while in those versions we reported $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ rates for the \textbf{best iterate}, in this corrected version these rates hold only w.r.t. the \textbf{average iterate}</p></details> |
| **[Futureproof Static Memory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04874v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The NP-complete combinatorial optimization task of assigning offsets to a set of buffers with known sizes and lifetimes so as to minimize total memory usage is called dynamic storage allocation (DSA). Existing DSA implementations bypass the theoretical state-of-the-art algorithms in favor of either fast but wasteful heuristics, or memory-efficient approaches that do not scale beyond one thousand buffers. The "AI memory wall", combined with deep neural networks' static architecture, has reignited interest in DSA. We present idealloc, a low-fragmentation, high-performance DSA implementation designed for million-buffer instances. Evaluated on a novel suite of particularly hard benchmarks from several domains, idealloc ranks first against four production implementations in terms of a joint effectiveness/robustness criterion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM TOPLAS</p></details> |

In this work, we present pc-COP, an efficient and configurable probabilistic computing hardware accelerator with 2048 fully connected probabilistic bits (p-bits) implemented on Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA. We propose a pseudo-parallel p-bit update architecture with speculate-and-select logic which improves overall performance by $4 \times$ compared to the traditional sequential p-bit update. Using our FPGA-based accelerator, we demonstrate the standard G-Set graph maximum cut benchmarks with near-99% average accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art hardware implementations, we achieve similar performance and accuracy with lower FPGA resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)</p></details> |
| **[CO-Bench: Benchmarking Language Model Agents in Algorithm Search for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04310v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems-a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agent frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing key strengths and limitations of current approaches and identifying promising directions for future research. CO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Phase Coupled CMOS Ring Oscillator based Potts Machine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04223v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a coupled ring oscillator based Potts ma chine to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Potts model is a generalization of the Ising model, cap turing multivalued spins in contrast to the binary-valued spins allowed in the Ising model. Similar to recent literature on Ising machines, the proposed architecture of Potts machines imple ments the Potts model with interacting spins represented by cou pled ring oscillators. Unlike Ising machines which are limited to two spin values, Potts machines model COPs that require a larger number of spin values. A major novelty of the proposed Potts machine is the utilization of the N-SHIL (Sub-Harmonic Injection Locking) mechanism, where multiple stable phases are obtained from a single (i.e. ring) oscillator. In evaluation, 3 coloring problems from the DIMACS SATBLIB benchmark and two randomly generated larger problems are mapped to the pro posed architecture. The proposed architecture is demonstrated to solve problems of varying size with 89% to 92% accuracy averaged over multiple iterations. The simulation results show that there is no degradation in accuracy, no significant increase in solution time, and only a linear increase in power dissipation with increasing problem sizes up to 2000 nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+2(r...</summary><p>8+2(ref) pages, 8 figures, International Conference of Computer Aided Design (ICCAD) 2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Offline reinforcement learning for job-shop scheduling problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15714v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems in real-time. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning can generate high-quality solutions efficiently, which is crucial for applications like routing and scheduling. However, existing approaches like deep reinforcement learning (RL) and behavioral cloning have notable limitations, with deep RL suffering from slow learning and behavioral cloning relying solely on expert actions, which can lead to generalization issues and neglect of the optimization objective. This paper introduces a novel offline RL method designed for combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints, where the state is represented as a heterogeneous graph and the action space is variable. Our approach encodes actions in edge attributes and balances expected rewards with the imitation of expert solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on job-shop scheduling and flexible job-shop scheduling benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymmetric Number Partitioning with Splitting and Interval Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11753v7)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The n-way number partitioning problem, a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, has significant implications for applications such as fair division and machine scheduling. Despite these problems being NP-hard, many approximation techniques exist. We consider three closely related kinds of approximations, and various objectives such as decision, min-max, max-min, and even a generalized objective, in which the bins are not considered identical anymore, but rather asymmetric (used to solve fair division to asymmetric agents or uniform machine scheduling problems). The first two variants optimize the partition such that: in the first variant some fixed number s of items can be split between two or more bins and in the second variant we allow at most a fixed number t of splittings. The third variant is a decision problem: the largest bin sum must be within a pre-specified interval, parameterized by a fixed rational number u times the largest item size. When the number of bins n is unbounded, we show that every variant is strongly NP-complete. When the number of bins n is fixed, the running time depends on the fixed parameters s,t,u. For each variant, we give a complete picture of its running time. For n=2, the running time is easy to identify. Our main results consider any fixed n>=3. Using a two-way polynomial-time reduction between the first and the third variant, we show that n-way number-partitioning with s split items can be solved in polynomial time if s>=n-2, and it is NP-complete otherwise. Also, n-way number-partitioning with t splittings can be solved in polynomial time if t>=n-1, and it is NP-complete otherwise. Finally, we show that the third variant can be solved in polynomial time if u>=(n-2)/n, and it is NP-complete otherwise. Our positive results for the optimization problems consider both asymmetric min-max and asymmetric max-min versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Training of Multi-task Neural Solver for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06361v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently training a multi-task neural solver for various combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) has been less studied so far. Naive application of conventional multi-task learning approaches often falls short in delivering a high-quality, unified neural solver. This deficiency primarily stems from the significant computational demands and a lack of adequate consideration for the complexities inherent in COPs. In this paper, we propose a general and efficient training paradigm to deliver a unified combinatorial multi-task neural solver. To this end, we resort to the theoretical loss decomposition for multiple tasks under an encoder-decoder framework, which enables more efficient training via proper bandit task-sampling algorithms through an intra-task influence matrix. By employing theoretically grounded approximations, our method significantly enhances overall performance, regardless of whether it is within constrained training budgets, across equivalent training epochs, or in terms of generalization capabilities, when compared to conventional training schedules. On the real-world datasets of TSPLib and CVRPLib, our method also achieved the best results compared to single task learning and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, the influence matrix provides empirical evidence supporting common practices in the field of learning to optimize, further substantiating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/LOGO-CUHKSZ/MTL-COP.</p></details> | Accepted by TMLR |
| **[QPanda3: A High-Performance Software-Hardware Collaborative Framework for Large-Scale Quantum-Classical Computing Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02455v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>QPanda3 is a high-performance quantum programming framework that enhances quantum computing efficiency through optimized circuit compilation, an advanced instruction stream format (OriginBIS), and hardware-aware execution strategies. These engineering optimizations significantly improve both processing speed and system performance, addressing key challenges in the NISQ era. A core innovation, OriginBIS, accelerates encoding speeds by up to 86.9x compared to OpenQASM 2.0, while decoding is 35.6x faster, leading to more efficient data handling, reduced memory overhead, and improved communication efficiency. This directly enhances the execution of quantum circuits, making large-scale quantum simulations more feasible. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates QPanda3's superior performance: quantum circuit construction is 20.7x faster, execution speeds improve by 3.4x, and transpilation efficiency increases by 14.97x over Qiskit. Notably, in compiling a 118-qubit W-state circuit on a 2D-grid topology, QPanda3 achieves an unprecedented 869.9x speedup, underscoring its ability to handle complex quantum workloads at scale. By combining high-speed quantum processing with a modular and extensible software architecture, QPanda3 provides a practical bridge between today's NISQ devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. It facilitates real-world applications in financial modeling, materials science, and combinatorial optimization, while its robust and scalable design supports industrial adoption and cloud-based deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning-assisted High-speed Combinatorial Optimization with Ising Machines for Dynamically Changing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23966v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum or quantum-inspired Ising machines have recently shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems in a short time. Real-world applications, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks and financial trading, require solving those problems sequentially where the size and characteristics change dynamically. However, using Ising machines involves challenges to shorten system-wide latency due to the transfer of large Ising model or the cloud access and to determine the parameters for each problem. Here we show a combinatorial optimization method using embedded Ising machines, which enables solving diverse problems at high speed without runtime parameter tuning. We customize the algorithm and circuit architecture of the simulated bifurcation-based Ising machine to compress the Ising model and accelerate computation and then built a machine learning model to estimate appropriate parameters using extensive training data. In TDMA scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks, our demonstration has shown that the sophisticated system can adapt to changes in the problem and showed that it has a speed advantage over conventional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Computation Algorithms for Knapsack: impossibility results, and how to avoid them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01543v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local Computation Algorithms (LCA), as introduced by Rubinfeld, Tamir, Vardi, and Xie (2011), are a type of ultra-efficient algorithms which, given access to a (large) input for a given computational task, are required to provide fast query access to a consistent output solution, without maintaining a state between queries. This paradigm of computation in particular allows for hugely distributed algorithms, where independent instances of a given LCA provide consistent access to a common output solution. The past decade has seen a significant amount of work on LCAs, by and large focusing on graph problems. In this paper, we initiate the study of Local Computation Algorithms for perhaps the archetypal combinatorial optimization problem, Knapsack. We first establish strong impossibility results, ruling out the existence of any non-trivial LCA for Knapsack as several of its relaxations. We then show how equipping the LCA with additional access to the Knapsack instance, namely, weighted item sampling, allows one to circumvent these impossibility results, and obtain sublinear-time and query LCAs. Our positive result draws on a connection to the recent notion of reproducibility for learning algorithms (Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell, 2022), a connection we believe to be of independent interest for the design of LCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Oscillator-Based Ising Machine Models with Amplitude Dynamics and Polynomial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00329v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an oscillator model with both phase and amplitude dynamics for oscillator-based Ising machines that addresses combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order. Our approach addresses fundamental limitations of previous oscillator-based Ising machines through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance. This work strengthens both the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of oscillator-based Ising machines for complex optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deriving Representative Structure from Music Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15849v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Coupled Input-Output Dimension Reduction: Application to Goal-oriented Bayesian Experimental Design and Global Sensitivity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13425v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol' indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Combinatorial Pricing Problems using Embedded Dynamic Programming Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12923v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combinatorial pricing problem (CPP) is a bilevel problem in which the leader maximizes their revenue by imposing tolls on certain items that they can control. Based on the tolls set by the leader, the follower selects a subset of items corresponding to an optimal solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. To accomplish the leader's goal, the tolls need to be sufficiently low to discourage the follower from choosing the items offered by the competitors. In this paper, we derive a single-level reformulation for the CPP by rewriting the follower's problem as a longest path problem using a dynamic programming model, and then taking its dual and applying strong duality. We proceed to solve the reformulation in a dynamic fashion with a cutting plane method. We apply this methodology to two distinct dynamic programming models, namely, a novel formulation designated as selection diagram and the well-known decision diagram. We also produce numerical results to evaluate their performances across three different specializations of the CPP and a closely related problem that is the knapsack interdiction problem. Our results showcase the potential of the two proposed reformulations over the natural value function approach, expanding the set of tools to solve combinatorial bilevel programs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization that requires efficient job allocation to machines to minimize makespan. To this end, we introduce Starjob, the first supervised dataset for JSSP, comprising 130k instances specifically designed for training LLMs. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune the LLaMA 8B 4-bit quantized model with the LoRA method to develop an end-to-end scheduling approach. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based method not only surpasses traditional Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) but also achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art neural approaches like L2D, with an average improvement of 15.36% on DMU and 7.85% on Taillard benchmarks. These results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.06993</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(2^{n/2}\bigr)$, still the best-known deterministic bound. Yet many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so actual hardness often depends on the number of unique sums ($U$). We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only distinct sums, pruning duplicates on the fly, thus running in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(U)$ when $U \ll 2^n$. Its core is a unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy and lightweight dynamic programming, avoiding the classical MIM's expensive merge. We also introduce combinatorial tree compression to guarantee strictly sub-$2^{n/2}$ enumeration even on unstructured inputs, shaving a nontrivial constant from the exponent. Our solver supports anytime and online modes, producing partial solutions early and adapting to newly added elements. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that for structured instances -- e.g. with small doubling constants, high additive energy, or significant redundancy -- our method can far outperform classical approaches, often nearing dynamic-programming efficiency. Even in the worst case, it remains within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(2^{n/2}\bigr)$, and its compression-based pruning yields a real constant-factor speedup over naive MIM. We conclude by discussing how this instance-specific adaptivity refines the Subset Sum complexity landscape and suggesting future adaptive-exponential directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, preliminary, extended version</p></details> |

Unlike supervised or reinforcement learning, PLUME search learns directly from problem instances using a permutation-based loss with a non-autoregressive approach. We evaluate its performance on the quadratic assignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard problem that encompasses various combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.</p></details> | preprint |

The goal is to embed such metrics within general optimization models allowing their efficient computation. We assess the usefulness of this approach applying it to three different families of measures, namely linear, nested, and quadratic ordered measures. Computational results are reported showing the efficiency and accuracy of our methods as compared with standard implementations in numerical software packages. Finally, we illustrate this methodology by computing a number of optimal solutions with respect to different metrics on three well-known linear and combinatorial optimization problems: scenario analysis in linear programming, the traveling salesman and the weighted multicover set problem.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Preference Optimization for Combinatorial Optimization (POCO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) an efficient preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) a novel loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-Shop Scheduling (JSP), Traveling Salesman (TSP), and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (FJSP) show POCO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. POCO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputing Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20212v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems by providing quantum speedup on near-term gate-based quantum computing systems. However, QAOA faces challenges for high-dimensional problems due to the large number of qubits required and the complexity of deep circuits, limiting its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we present a distributed QAOA (DQAOA), which leverages distributed computing strategies to decompose a large computational workload into smaller tasks that require fewer qubits and shallower circuits than necessitated to solve the original problem. These sub-problems are processed using a combination of high-performance and quantum computing resources. The global solution is iteratively updated by aggregating sub-solutions, allowing convergence toward the optimal solution. We demonstrate that DQAOA can handle considerably large-scale optimization problems (e.g., 1,000-bit problem) achieving a high approximation ratio ($\sim$99%) and short time-to-solution ($\sim$276 s), outperforming existing strategies. Furthermore, we realize DQAOA on a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, paving the way for practical applications of gate-based quantum computers in real-world optimization tasks. To extend DQAOA's applicability to materials science, we further develop an active learning algorithm integrated with our DQAOA (AL-DQAOA), which involves machine learning, DQAOA, and active data production in an iterative loop. We successfully optimize photonic structures using AL-DQAOA, indicating that solving real-world optimization problems using gate-based quantum computing is feasible. We expect the proposed DQAOA to be applicable to a wide range of optimization problems and AL-DQAOA to find broader applications in material design.</p></details> |  |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |

On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to provide a near-term route to quantum utility or advantage, and is usually constructed by using parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in combination with a classical optimizer for training. Although VQAs have been proposed for a multitude of tasks such as ground-state estimation, combinatorial optimization and unitary compilation, there remain major challenges in its trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra Supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training schemes that combine an existing g-sim method (that uses the underlying group structure of the operators) and the Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically test our proposal for ground-state estimation using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and classification of quantum phases using quantum neural networks. Our methods show better accuracy and success of trials, and also need fewer calls to the quantum hardware on an average than using only PSR (upto 60% reduction), that runs exclusively on quantum hardware. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 4 algorithms</p></details> |

However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical approaches, as it can learn fast heuristics to solve VRPs. However, most research works in NCO for VRPs focus on simplified settings, which do not account for asymmetric distances and travel durations that cannot be derived by simple Euclidean distances and unrealistic data distributions, hindering real-world deployment. This work introduces RRNCO (Real Routing NCO) to bridge the gap of NCO between synthetic and real-world VRPs in the critical aspects of both data and modeling. First, we introduce a new, openly available dataset with real-world data containing a diverse dataset of locations, distances, and duration matrices from 100 cities, considering realistic settings with actual routing distances and durations obtained from Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). Second, we propose a novel approach that efficiently processes both node and edge features through contextual gating, enabling the construction of more informed node embedding, and we finally incorporate an Adaptation Attention Free Module (AAFM) with neural adaptive bias mechanisms that effectively integrates not only distance matrices but also angular relationships between nodes, allowing our model to capture rich structural information. RRNCO achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world VRPs among NCO methods. We make our dataset and code publicly available at https://github.com/ai4co/real-routing-nco.</p></details> |  |

We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

To explore the potential of the world model in the remote sensing (RS) field, this paper proposes a label-efficient remote sensing world model for multimodal data fusion (FusDreamer). The FusDreamer uses the world model as a unified representation container to abstract common and high-level knowledge, promoting interactions across different types of data, \emph{i.e.}, hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and text data. Initially, a new latent diffusion fusion and multimodal generation paradigm (LaMG) is utilized for its exceptional information integration and detail retention capabilities. Subsequently, an open-world knowledge-guided consistency projection (OK-CP) module incorporates prompt representations for visually described objects and aligns language-visual features through contrastive learning. In this way, the domain gap can be bridged by fine-tuning the pre-trained world models with limited samples. Finally, an end-to-end multitask combinatorial optimization (MuCO) strategy can capture slight feature bias and constrain the diffusion process in a collaboratively learnable direction. Experiments conducted on four typical datasets indicate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed FusDreamer. The corresponding code will be released at https://github.com/Cimy-wang/FusDreamer.</p></details> |  |

We propose to extend this powerful combination to the control of dynamical systems, generating interpretable control policies capable of complex behaviors. With our novel method, we represent control policies as programs in standard languages like Python. We evaluate candidate controllers in simulation and evolve them using a pre-trained LLM. Unlike conventional learning-based control techniques, which rely on black-box neural networks to encode control policies, our approach enhances transparency and interpretability. We still take advantage of the power of large AI models, but only at the policy design phase, ensuring that all system components remain interpretable and easily verifiable at runtime. Additionally, the use of standard programming languages makes it straightforward for humans to finetune or adapt the controllers based on their expertise and intuition. We illustrate our method through its application to the synthesis of an interpretable control policy for the pendulum swing-up and the ball in cup tasks. We make the code available at https://github.com/muellerlab/synthesizing_interpretable_control_policies.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Regulators favour conservative approaches for robust type I error control, though excessive conservatism may significantly reduce statistical power. We offer fundamental theoretical contributions that extend an approach proposed in 1969, resulting in the derivation of a family of exact tests designed to maximize a specific type of power. We establish theoretical guarantees for controlling type I error despite the discretization of the null parameter space. This theoretical advancement is supported by a comprehensive series of experiments to empirically quantify the power advantages compared to traditional hypothesis tests. The approach determines the rejection region through a binary decision for each outcome dataset and uses integer programming to find an optimal decision boundary that maximizes power subject to type I error constraints. Our analysis provides new theoretical properties and insights into this approach's comparative advantages. When optimized for average power over all possible parameter configurations under the alternative, the method exhibits remarkable robustness, performing optimally or near-optimally across specific alternatives while maintaining exact type I error control. The method can be further customized for particular prior beliefs by using a weighted average. The findings highlight both the method's practical utility and how techniques from combinatorial optimization can enhance statistical methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation. Unlike traditional software, LLM-based NLP software relies on prompts and examples as inputs. Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs, quantitatively assessing the robustness of such software is crucial. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated robustness testing methods have been specifically designed to evaluate the overall inputs of LLM-based NLP software. To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem. Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search. ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking. We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models. ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%. Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p></details> |  |

Even for systems of linear equations that are highly sparse, their direct solution via factorization methods, such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, is computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on the variational quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm (VarQITE), allowing to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of reordering of sparse matrices to minimize the fill-in. We develop a hybrid quantum/classical pipeline to accelerate Finite Element solvers by integrating the VarQITE algorithm into the production workflow of Ansys' industrial software LS-DYNA. This allows to study multiple different types of FEA problems, ranging from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics. We prove out that VarQITE positively impacts LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems when compared against the classical heuristic graph partitioning solver in LS-DYNA. The selected instances cover a range of FEA problems, including simulation of blood pumps, roof crushing of cars, and vibration analysis of cars. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum-accelerated workflow on FEA meshes of up to 5.9M vertices and 55 million edges. We find that the wall clock time of the heuristics solutions used in the industry-grade solver is improved by up to 12\%. We also execute the VarQITE algorithm on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte) and find that the results are comparable to noiseless and noisy simulations. Finally, we introduce a hybrid technique for post-processing the found solutions with classical refinement heuristics such as Fiduccia-Mattheyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[HETRI: Heterogeneous Ising Multiprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23517v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising machines are effective solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems. The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial optimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which naturally converges to a minimum energy state upon perturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, can capture the dynamic behavior of different physical systems by mapping each problem variable to a spin which can interact with other spins. Ising model as a mathematical abstraction can be mapped to hardware using traditional devices. In this paper we instead focus on Ising machines which represent a network of physical spins directly implemented in hardware using, e.g., quantum bits or electronic oscillators. To eliminate the scalability bottleneck due to the mismatch in problem vs. Ising machine size and connectivity, in this paper we make the case for HETRI: Heterogeneous Ising Multiprocessing. HETRI organizes the maximum number of physical spins that the underlying technology supports in Ising cores; and multiple independent Ising cores, in Ising chips. Ising cores in a chip feature different inter-spin connectivity or spin counts to match the problem characteristics. We provide a detailed design space exploration and quantify the performance in terms of time or energy to solution and solution accuracy with respect to homogeneous alternatives under the very same hardware budget and considering the very same spin technology.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this goal necessitates optimizing operational decision-making to efficiently manage ambulances. Against this background, we study a centrally controlled EMS system for which we learn an online ambulance dispatching and redeployment policy that aims at minimizing the mean response time of ambulances within the system by dispatching an ambulance upon receiving an emergency call and redeploying it to a waiting location upon the completion of its service. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization-augmented machine learning pipeline that allows to learn efficient policies for ambulance dispatching and redeployment. In this context, we further show how to solve the underlying full-information problem to generate training data and propose an augmentation scheme that improves our pipeline's generalization performance by mitigating a possible distribution mismatch with respect to the considered state space. Compared to existing methods that rely on augmentation during training, our approach offers substantial runtime savings of up to 87.9% while yielding competitive performance. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline against current industry practices, we conduct a numerical case study on the example of San Francisco's 911 call data. Results show that the learned policies outperform the online benchmarks across various resource and demand scenarios, yielding a reduction in mean response time of up to 30%.</p></details> |  |

A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems.

Although LLMs excel at interpreting nuanced, locally specified requirements, they struggle with enforcing global combinatorial feasibility. To bridge this gap, we propose an iterated fine-tuning framework where algorithmic feedback progressively refines the LLM's output distribution. Interpreting this as simulated annealing, we introduce a formal model based on a "coarse learnability" assumption, providing sample complexity bounds for convergence. Empirical evaluations on scheduling, graph connectivity, and clustering tasks demonstrate that our framework balances the flexibility of locally expressed constraints with rigorous global optimization more effectively compared to baseline sampling methods. Our results highlight a promising direction for hybrid AI-driven combinatorial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Constraint-Based Adaptive Hypergraph Learning for Solving Vehicle Routing: An End-to-End Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10421v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of learning based methods to vehicle routing problems has emerged as a pivotal area of research in combinatorial optimization. These problems are characterized by vast solution spaces and intricate constraints, making traditional approaches such as exact mathematical models or heuristic methods prone to high computational overhead or reliant on the design of complex heuristic operators to achieve optimal or near optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although some recent learning-based methods can produce good performance for VRP with straightforward constraint scenarios, they often fail to effectively handle hard constraints that are common in practice. This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines constraint-oriented hypergraphs with reinforcement learning to address vehicle routing problems. A central innovation of this work is the development of a constraint-oriented dynamic hyperedge reconstruction strategy within an encoder, which significantly enhances hypergraph representation learning. Additionally, the decoder leverages a double-pointer attention mechanism to iteratively generate solutions. The proposed model is trained by incorporating asynchronous parameter updates informed by hypergraph constraints and optimizing a dual loss function comprising constraint loss and policy gradient loss. The experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the need for sophisticated heuristic operators but also achieves substantial improvements in solution quality.</p></details> |  |

It has been demonstrated in the literature that such special-purpose solvers can outperform traditional CMOS architectures by orders of magnitude with respect to timing metrics on synthetic problems. However, they face challenges with constrained problems such as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), where mapping to binary formulations such as QUBO introduces overhead and limits parallelism. In-memory computing (IMC) devices, such as memristor-based analog Ising machines, offer significant speedups and efficiency gains over traditional CPU-based solvers, particularly for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we present a novel local search heuristic designed for IMC hardware to tackle the QAP. Our approach enables massive parallelism that allows for computing of full neighbourhoods simultaneously to make update decisions. We ensure binary solutions remain feasible by selecting local moves that lead to neighbouring feasible solutions, leveraging feasible-space search heuristics and the underlying structure of a given problem. Our approach is compatible with both digital computers and analog hardware. We demonstrate its effectiveness in CPU implementations by comparing it with state-of-the-art heuristics for solving the QAP.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This problem can be formulated within the context of set optimization. For high-dimensional nonlinear systems, the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It scales poorly too. Current literature poses combinatorial submodular set optimization problems via maximizing observability performance metrics subject to matroid constraints. Such an approach is typically solved using greedy algorithms that require lower computational effort yet often yield sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address the SNS problem for nonlinear dynamical networks using a variational form of the system dynamics, that basically perturb the system physics. As a result, we show that the observability performance metrics under such system representation are indeed submodular. The optimal problem is then solved using the multilinear continuous extension. This extension offers a computationally scalable and approximate continuous relaxation with a performance guarantee. The effectiveness of the extended submodular program is studied and compared to greedy algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed set optimization formulation for SNS on nonlinear natural gas combustion networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 2025 American Control Conference (ACC'2025), Denver, Colorado, July 2025</p></details> |

Whereas supervised learning requires pre-solved instances for training, our approach leverages a custom loss function derived from the exact penalty method in optimization to learn an approximation, typically defined by a neural network model, of the parameterized optimal solution mapping. Additionally, we adapt our approach to robust constrained combinatorial optimization problems by incorporating a surrogate linear cost over mixed integer domains, and a smooth approximations thereof, into the final layer of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments to test our approach on three different applications: multidimensional knapsack with continuous variables, combinatorial multidimensional knapsack with discrete variables, and an inventory management problem. Our results demonstrate that our self-supervised approach is able to effectively learn neural network approximations whose inference time is significantly smaller than the computation time of traditional solvers for this class of robust optimization problems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that by varying the penalty parameter we are able to effectively balance the trade-off between sub-optimality and robust feasibility of the obtained solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of CPAIOR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Object Packing and Scheduling for Sequential 3D Printing: a Linear Arithmetic Model and a CEGAR-inspired Optimal Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05071v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of object arrangement and scheduling for sequential 3D printing. Unlike the standard 3D printing, where all objects are printed slice by slice at once, in sequential 3D printing, objects are completed one after other. In the sequential case, it is necessary to ensure that the moving parts of the printer do not collide with previously printed objects. We look at the sequential printing problem from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. We propose to express the problem as a linear arithmetic formula, which is then solved using a solver for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). However, we do not solve the formula expressing the problem of object arrangement and scheduling directly, but we have proposed a technique inspired by counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR), which turned out to be a key innovation to efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Global Minimum Cut with Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05004v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global minimum cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem with wide-ranging applications. Often in practice, these problems are solved repeatedly on families of similar or related instances. However, the de facto algorithmic approach is to solve each instance of the problem from scratch discarding information from prior instances. In this paper, we consider how predictions informed by prior instances can be used to warm-start practical minimum cut algorithms. The paper considers the widely used Karger's algorithm and its counterpart, the Karger-Stein algorithm. Given good predictions, we show these algorithms become near-linear time and have robust performance to erroneous predictions. Both of these algorithms are randomized edge-contraction algorithms. Our natural idea is to probabilistically prioritize the contraction of edges that are unlikely to be in the minimum cut.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Molecular Docking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04239v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular docking is a critical process for drug discovery and challenging due to the complexity and size of biomolecular systems, where the optimal binding configuration of a drug to a target protein is determined. Hybrid classical-quantum computing techniques offer a novel approach to address these challenges. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variations are hybrid classical-quantum techniques, and a promising tool for combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper presents a Digitized Counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA) approach to molecular docking. Simulated quantum runs were conducted on a GPU cluster. We examined 14 and 17 nodes instances - to the best of our knowledge the biggest published instance is 12-node at Ding et al. and we present the results. Based on computational results, we conclude that binding interactions represent the anticipated exact solution. Additionally, as the size of the examined instance increases, the computational times exhibit a significant escalation.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Reheated Gradient-based Discrete Sampling for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04047v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, gradient-based discrete sampling has emerged as a highly efficient, general-purpose solver for various combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing the popular data-driven approaches. However, we identify a critical issue in these methods, which we term ''wandering in contours''. This behavior refers to sampling new different solutions that share very similar objective values for a long time, leading to computational inefficiency and suboptimal exploration of potential solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel reheating mechanism inspired by the concept of critical temperature and specific heat in physics, aimed at overcoming this limitation. Empirically, our method demonstrates superiority over existing sampling-based and data-driven algorithms across a diverse array of CO problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Develop Heuristics for Emerging Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03350v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems often rely on heuristic algorithms to generate efficient solutions. However, the manual design of heuristics is resource-intensive and constrained by the designer's expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential to automate heuristic generation through evolutionary frameworks. Recent works focus only on well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem and online bin packing problem when designing constructive heuristics. This study investigates whether LLMs can effectively generate heuristics for niche, not yet broadly researched optimization problems, using the unit-load pre-marshalling problem as an example case. We propose the Contextual Evolution of Heuristics (CEoH) framework, an extension of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework, which incorporates problem-specific descriptions to enhance in-context learning during heuristic generation. Through computational experiments, we evaluate CEoH and EoH and compare the results. Results indicate that CEoH enables smaller LLMs to generate high-quality heuristics more consistently and even outperform larger models. Larger models demonstrate robust performance with or without contextualized prompts. The generated heuristics exhibit scalability to diverse instance configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review LION19: The 19th Learning and Intelligent OptimizatioN Conference</p></details> |
| **[L2R: Learning to Reduce Search Space for Generalizable Neural Routing Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03137v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructive neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has attracted growing research attention due to its ability to solve complex routing problems without relying on handcrafted rules. However, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on 100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A2Perf: Real-World Autonomous Agents Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03056v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents and systems cover a number of application areas, from robotics and digital assistants to combinatorial optimization, all sharing common, unresolved research challenges. It is not sufficient for agents to merely solve a given task; they must generalize to out-of-distribution tasks, perform reliably, and use hardware resources efficiently during training and inference, among other requirements. Several methods, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, are commonly used to tackle these problems, each with different trade-offs. However, there is a lack of benchmarking suites that define the environments, datasets, and metrics which can be used to provide a meaningful way for the community to compare progress on applying these methods to real-world problems. We introduce A2Perf--a benchmark with three environments that closely resemble real-world domains: computer chip floorplanning, web navigation, and quadruped locomotion. A2Perf provides metrics that track task performance, generalization, system resource efficiency, and reliability, which are all critical to real-world applications. Using A2Perf, we demonstrate that web navigation agents can achieve latencies comparable to human reaction times on consumer hardware, reveal reliability trade-offs between algorithms for quadruped locomotion, and quantify the energy costs of different learning approaches for computer chip-design. In addition, we propose a data cost metric to account for the cost incurred acquiring offline data for imitation learning and hybrid algorithms, which allows us to better compare these approaches. A2Perf also contains several standard baselines, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons across methods and facilitating progress in real-world autonomy. As an open-source benchmark, A2Perf is designed to remain accessible, up-to-date, and useful to the research community over the long term.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Bandwidth Observation Sharing for Multi-Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Intelligent Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09975v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.</p></details> |  |

The mechanics of the game present complex decision-making scenarios of resource management. Due the similarity of other card games, the strategy of the game have scenarios that can turn an NP-problem. This paper presents a model of an aggressive, single-turn strategy as a combinatorial optimization problem, termed the FAB problem. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate its equivalence to a 0-1 Knapsack problem, establishing the FAB problem as NP-hard. Additionally, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed to tackle real-world instances of the problem. By establishing the computational hardness of optimizing even relatively simple strategies, our work highlights the combinatorial complexity of the game.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABFS: Natural Robustness Testing for LLM-based NLP Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01319v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the exceptional performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based NLP software has rapidly gained traction across various domains, such as financial analysis and content moderation. However, these applications frequently exhibit robustness deficiencies, where slight perturbations in input (prompt+example) may lead to erroneous outputs. Current robustness testing methods face two main limitations: (1) low testing effectiveness, limiting the applicability of LLM-based software in safety-critical scenarios, and (2) insufficient naturalness of test cases, reducing the practical value of testing outcomes. To address these issues, this paper proposes ABFS, a straightforward yet effective automated testing method that, for the first time, treats the input prompts and examples as a unified whole for robustness testing. Specifically, ABFS formulates the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem, employing Best-First Search to identify successful test cases within the perturbation space and designing a novel Adaptive control strategy to enhance test case naturalness. We evaluate the robustness testing performance of ABFS on three datasets across five threat models. On Llama2-13b, the traditional StressTest achieves only a 13.273% success rate, while ABFS attains a success rate of 98.064%, supporting a more comprehensive robustness assessment before software deployment. Compared to baseline methods, ABFS introduces fewer modifications to the original input and consistently generates test cases with superior naturalness. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABFS exhibit stronger transferability and higher testing efficiency, significantly reducing testing costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMOPT: Learning to Define and Solve General Optimization Problems from Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13213v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems are prevalent across various scenarios. Formulating and then solving optimization problems described by natural language often requires highly specialized human expertise, which could block the widespread application of optimization-based decision making. To automate problem formulation and solving, leveraging large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a potential way. However, this kind of approach suffers from the issue of optimization generalization. Namely, the accuracy of most current LLM-based methods and the generality of optimization problem types that they can model are still limited. In this paper, we propose a unified learning-based framework called LLMOPT to boost optimization generalization. Starting from the natural language descriptions of optimization problems and a pre-trained LLM, LLMOPT constructs the introduced five-element formulation as a universal model for learning to define diverse optimization problem types. Then, LLMOPT employs the multi-instruction tuning to enhance both problem formalization and solver code generation accuracy and generality. After that, to prevent hallucinations in LLMs, such as sacrificing solving accuracy to avoid execution errors, the model alignment and self-correction mechanism are adopted in LLMOPT. We evaluate the optimization generalization ability of LLMOPT and compared methods across six real-world datasets covering roughly 20 fields such as health, environment, energy and manufacturing, etc. Extensive experiment results show that LLMOPT is able to model various optimization problem types such as linear/nonlinear programming, mixed integer programming, and combinatorial optimization, and achieves a notable 11.08% average solving accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/caigaojiang/LLMOPT.</p></details> |  |

The core component of NeuroSA consists of a pair of asynchronous ON-OFF neurons, which effectively map classical simulated annealing dynamics onto a network of integrate-and-fire neurons. The threshold of each ON-OFF neuron pair is adaptively adjusted by an FN annealer and the resulting spiking dynamics replicates the optimal escape mechanism and convergence of SA, particularly at low-temperatures. To validate the effectiveness of our neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and Max Independent Set. Across multiple runs, NeuroSA consistently generates distribution of solutions that are concentrated around the state-of-the-art results (within 99%) or surpass the current state-of-the-art solutions for Max Independent Set benchmarks. Furthermore, NeuroSA is able to achieve these superior distributions without any graph-specific hyperparameter tuning. For practical illustration, we present results from an implementation of NeuroSA on the SpiNNaker2 platform, highlighting the feasibility of mapping our proposed architecture onto a standard neuromorphic accelerator platform.</p></details> | 43 pages, 10 figures |

This paper introduces a new divide-and-conquer approach for causal graph learning, called DCILP. In the divide phase, the Markov blanket MB($X_i$) of each variable $X_i$ is identified, and causal learning subproblems associated with each MB($X_i$) are independently addressed in parallel. This approach benefits from a more favorable ratio between the number of data samples and the number of variables considered. In counterpart, it can be adversely affected by the presence of hidden confounders, as variables external to MB($X_i$) might influence those within it. The reconciliation of the local causal graphs generated during the divide phase is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, especially in large-scale applications. The main novelty of DCILP is an original formulation of this reconciliation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which can be delegated and efficiently handled by an ILP solver. Through experiments on medium to large scale graphs, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, DCILP demonstrates significant improvements in terms of computational complexity, while preserving the learning accuracy on real-world problem and suffering at most a slight loss of accuracy on synthetic problems.</p></details> |  |

Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github respository will be provided soon</p></details> |

While exact solutions are often not necessary, many applications require finding high-quality solutions quickly. For this purpose, we propose a data-driven approach to improve existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. We parameterize the approximation algorithm and train a graph neural network (GNN) to predict parameter values that lead to the best possible solutions. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion using gradient estimation, treating the approximation algorithm as a black box. We propose a novel gradient estimation scheme for this purpose, which we call preference-based gradient estimation. Our approach combines the benefits of the neural network and the non-learned approximation algorithm: The GNN leverages the information from the dataset to allow the approximation algorithm to find better solutions, while the approximation algorithm guarantees that the solution is feasible. We validate our approach on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the travelling salesman problem and the minimum k-cut problem, and show that our method is competitive with state of the art learned CO solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, under review</p></details> |

This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> |

In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05783v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALF: Aligning LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Cross-modal Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents StayLTC, a multimodal deep learning framework developed to forecast real-time hospital LOS using Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs). LTCs, with their continuous-time recurrent dynamics, are evaluated against traditional models using structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical notes. Our evaluation, conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset, demonstrated that LTCs significantly outperform most of the other time series models, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, LTCs demonstrate a comparable performance in LOS prediction compared to time series large language models, while requiring significantly less computational power and memory, underscoring their potential to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in healthcare.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaze-Guided Learning: Avoiding Shortcut Bias in Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05583v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by human visual attention, deep neural networks have widely adopted attention mechanisms to learn locally discriminative attributes for challenging visual classification tasks. However, existing approaches primarily emphasize the representation of such features while neglecting their precise localization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases. This limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on transfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of leveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained attributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and high-variance classification scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce Gaze-CIFAR-10, a human gaze time-series dataset, along with a dual-sequence gaze encoder that models the precise sequential localization of human attention on distinct local attributes. In parallel, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed to learn the sequential representation of image content. Through cross-modal fusion, our framework integrates human gaze priors with machine-derived visual sequences, effectively correcting inaccurate localization in image feature representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that gaze-guided cognitive cues significantly enhance classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, URL: https://szyyjl.github.io/eye_tracking_data.github.io/</p></details> |

This is influenced by numerous meteorological factors, geographical positioning, and photovoltaic cell properties, posing significant challenges to forecasting accuracy and grid stability. Our study introduces a suite of solutions centered around hybrid quantum neural networks designed to tackle these complexities. The first proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory, surpasses all tested models by achieving mean absolute errors and mean squared errors that are more than 40% lower. The second proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence neural network, once trained, predicts photovoltaic power with 16% lower mean absolute error for arbitrary time intervals without the need for prior meteorological data, highlighting its versatility. Moreover, our hybrid models perform better even when trained on limited datasets, underlining their potential utility in data-scarce scenarios. These findings represent progress towards resolving time series prediction challenges in energy forecasting through hybrid quantum models, showcasing the transformative potential of quantum machine learning in catalyzing the renewable energy transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Real-Time Video Motion Transfer via Generative Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05537v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

Although previously employed in non-invasive, the utility of Riemannian geometry for invasive datasets, which are typically smaller and scarcer, remains less explored. Here, we propose a Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier using a Riemannian geometry approach based on covariance matrices extracted from intracortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings across various regions during different brain state dynamics. For benchmarking, we evaluated the performance of our approach against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Euclidean MDM classifiers. Our results indicate that the Riemannian geometry-based classification not only achieves a superior mean F1 macro-averaged score across different channel configurations but also requires up to two orders of magnitude less computational training time. Additionally, the geometric framework reveals distinct spatial contributions of brain regions across varying brain states, suggesting a state-dependent organization that traditional time series-based methods often fail to capture. Our findings align with previous studies supporting the efficacy of geometry-based methods and extending their application to invasive brain recordings, highlighting their potential for broader clinical use, such as brain computer interface applications.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Debiasing Continuous-time Nonlinear Autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05525v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to identify a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems defined by an ordinary differential equation affine in the unknown parameter. We define a notion of asymptotic consistency as $(n, h) \to (\infty, 0)$, and we achieve it using a family of direct methods where the first step is differentiating a noisy time series and the second step is a plug-in linear estimator. The first step, differentiation, is a signal processing adaptation of the nonparametric statistical technique of local polynomial regression. The second step, generalized linear regression, can be consistent using a least squares estimator, but we demonstrate two novel bias corrections that improve the accuracy for finite $h$. These methods significantly broaden the class of continuous-time systems that can be consistently estimated by direct methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |

We show that many known aggregation operations can be interpreted as (double) functors on appropriate (double) categories. Such functorial aggregations are amenable to parallel implementation via straightforward extensions of Blelloch's parallel scan algorithm. In addition to providing a unified viewpoint on existing operations, it allows us to propose new aggregation operations for time-series and image data.</p></details> |  |

The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Extraction for Time Series with ECLAD-ts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05024v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for time series classification (TSC) are being increasingly used in applications ranging from quality prediction to medical diagnosis. The black box nature of these models makes understanding their prediction process difficult. This issue is crucial because CNNs are prone to learning shortcuts and biases, compromising their robustness and alignment with human expectations. To assess whether such mechanisms are being used and the associated risk, it is essential to provide model explanations that reflect the inner workings of the model. Concept Extraction (CE) methods offer such explanations, but have mostly been developed for the image domain so far, leaving a gap in the time series domain. In this work, we present a CE and localization method tailored to the time series domain, based on the ideas of CE methods for images. We propose the novel method ECLAD-ts, which provides post-hoc global explanations based on how the models encode subsets of the input at different levels of abstraction. For this, concepts are produced by clustering timestep-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps, and their importance is computed based on their impact on the prediction process. We evaluate our method on synthetic and natural datasets. Furthermore, we assess the advantages and limitations of CE in time series through empirical results. Our results show that ECLAD-ts effectively explains models by leveraging their internal representations, providing useful insights about their prediction process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Policy: Imitation Policy Learning in Frequency Domain with Wavelet Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04991v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent imitation learning policies, often framed as time series prediction tasks, directly map robotic observations-such as high-dimensional visual data and proprioception-into the action space. While time series prediction primarily relies on spatial domain modeling, the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction may lead to neglecting the inherent temporal information embedded within action sequences. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of the frequency domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features from the frequency domain using the SE2MD (Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the frequency domain and increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Frequency-Domain Filter (LFDF) after each frequency decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods by over 10% on four challenging robotic arm tasks, while maintaining a comparable parameter count. In long-range settings, its performance declines more slowly as task volume increases. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics pose significant challenges for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While substantial progress has been made, a systematic synthesis of advancements remains lacking. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive review of OOD generalization methodologies for time series, organized to delineate the field's evolutionary trajectory and contemporary research landscape. We organize our analysis across three foundational dimensions: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For each dimension, we present several popular algorithms in detail. Furthermore, we highlight key application scenarios, emphasizing their real-world impact. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and propose future research directions. A detailed summary of the methods reviewed for the generalization of OOD in time series can be accessed at https://tsood-generalization.com.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic spectral co-clustering of directed networks to unveil latent community paths in VAR-type models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10849v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying network Granger causality in large vector autoregressive (VAR) models enhances explanatory power by capturing complex interdependencies among variables. Instead of constructing network structures solely through sparse estimation of coefficients, we explore latent community structures to uncover the underlying network dynamics. We propose a dynamic network framework that embeds directed connectivity within the transition matrices of VAR-type models, enabling tracking of evolving community structures over time. To incorporate network directionality, we employ degree-corrected stochastic co-block models for each season or cycle, integrating spectral co-clustering with singular vector smoothing to refine latent community transitions. For greater model parsimony, we adopt periodic VAR (PVAR) and vector heterogeneous autoregressive (VHAR) models as alternatives to high-lag VAR models. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness through applications to the cyclic evolution of US nonfarm payroll employment and the temporal progression of realized stock market volatilities. Indeed, spectral co-clustering of directed networks reveals dynamic latent community trajectories, offering deeper insights into the evolving structure of high-dimensional time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interval-Valued Time Series Classification Using $D_K$-Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04667v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, modeling and analysis of interval-valued time series have garnered increasing attention in econometrics, finance, and statistics. However, these studies have predominantly focused on statistical inference in the forecasting of univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series, overlooking another important aspect: classification. In this paper, we introduce a classification approach that treats intervals as unified entities, applicable to both univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series. Specifically, we first extend the point-valued time series imaging methods to interval-valued scenarios using the $D_K$-distance, enabling the imaging of interval-valued time series. Then, we employ suitable deep learning model for classification on the obtained imaging dataset, aiming to achieve classification for interval-valued time series. In theory, we derived a sharper excess risk bound for deep multiclassifiers based on offset Rademacher complexity. Finally, we validate the superiority of the proposed method through comparisons with various existing point-valued time series classification methods in both simulation studies and real data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Prediction of Peaks Over a Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04602v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many applied fields, the prediction of more severe events than those already recorded is crucial for safeguarding against potential future calamities. What-if analyses, which evaluate hypothetical scenarios up to the worst-case event, play a key role in assessing the potential impacts of extreme events and guiding the development of effective safety policies. This problem can be analyzed using extreme value theory. We employ the well-established peaks-over-threshold method and describe a comprehensive toolkit to address forecasting needs. We examine an \lq\lq out-of-sample" variable and focus on its conditional probability of exceeding a high threshold, representing the predictive distribution of future extreme peaks. We demonstrate that the generalized Pareto approximation of the corresponding predictive density can be remarkably accurate. We then introduce frequentist methods and a Bayesian approach for estimating this predictive density, enabling the derivation of informative predictive intervals. By leveraging threshold stability, we illustrate how predictions can be reliably extended deep into the tail of the unknown data distribution. We establish the asymptotic accuracy of the proposed estimators and, more importantly, prove that the resulting predictive inference is asymptotically valid. Forecasters satisfying the tail-equivalence property allow to recover widely used risk measures for risk assessment through point forecasts. This insight lays the groundwork for a new perspective that integrates risk assessment into the statistical predictive toolbox. Finally, we extend the prediction framework to the case of linear time series. We apply the proposed predictive tools to two real-world datasets: summer peak temperatures recorded in Milan, Italy, over the past 30 years, and daily negative log-returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average observed over 30 years.</p></details> |  |

The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.</p></details> |  |

| **[iADCPS: Time Series Anomaly Detection for Evolving Cyber-physical Systems via Incremental Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04374v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection for cyber-physical systems (ADCPS) is crucial in identifying faults and potential attacks by analyzing the time series of sensor measurements and actuator states. However, current methods lack adaptation to data distribution shifts in both temporal and spatial dimensions as cyber-physical systems evolve. To tackle this issue, we propose an incremental meta-learning-based approach, namely iADCPS, which can continuously update the model through limited evolving normal samples to reconcile the distribution gap between evolving and historical time series. Specifically, We first introduce a temporal mixup strategy to align data for data-level generalization which is then combined with the one-class meta-learning approach for model-level generalization. Furthermore, we develop a non-parametric dynamic threshold to adaptively adjust the threshold based on the probability density of the abnormal scores without any anomaly supervision. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the iADCPS using three publicly available datasets PUMP, SWaT, and WADI. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 99.0%, 93.1%, and 78.7% F1-Score, respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ADCPS method, especially in the context of the evolving CPSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14474v4)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[CATS: Mitigating Correlation Shift for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04283v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) leverages labeled source data to train models for unlabeled target data. Given the prevalence of multivariate time series (MTS) data across various domains, the UDA task for MTS classification has emerged as a critical challenge. However, for MTS data, correlations between variables often vary across domains, whereas most existing UDA works for MTS classification have overlooked this essential characteristic. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel domain shift, {\em correlation shift}, measuring domain differences in multivariate correlation. To mitigate correlation shift, we propose a scalable and parameter-efficient \underline{C}orrelation \underline{A}dapter for M\underline{TS} (CATS). Designed as a plug-and-play technique compatible with various Transformer variants, CATS employs temporal convolution to capture local temporal patterns and a graph attention module to model the changing multivariate correlation. The adapter reweights the target correlations to align the source correlations with a theoretically guaranteed precision. A correlation alignment loss is further proposed to mitigate correlation shift, bypassing the alignment challenge from the non-i.i.d. nature of MTS data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that (1) compared with vanilla Transformer-based models, CATS increases over $10\%$ average accuracy while only adding around $1\%$ parameters, and (2) all Transformer variants equipped with CATS either reach or surpass state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions, covering fundamental metrics like Mean Squared Error and Cross-Entropy to advanced functions such as Adversarial and Diffusion losses. We explore their mathematical foundations, impact on model training, and strategic selection for various applications, including computer vision (Discriminative and generative), tabular data prediction, and time series forecasting. For each of these categories, we discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Also, this review explore the historical evolution, computational efficiency, and ongoing challenges in loss function design, underlining the need for more adaptive and robust solutions. Emphasis is placed on complex scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalances, and real-world constraints. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional SSMs are limited by fixed, one-dimensional sequential processing, which restricts their ability to model non-local interactions in high-dimensional data. While methods like Mamba and VMamba introduce selective and flexible scanning strategies, they rely on predetermined paths, which fails to efficiently capture complex dependencies. We introduce Graph-Generating State Space Models (GG-SSMs), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by dynamically constructing graphs based on feature relationships. Using Chazelle's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, GG-SSMs adapt to the inherent data structure, enabling robust feature propagation across dynamically generated graphs and efficiently modeling complex dependencies. We validate GG-SSMs on 11 diverse datasets, including event-based eye-tracking, ImageNet classification, optical flow estimation, and six time series datasets. GG-SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, surpassing existing methods by significant margins. Specifically, GG-SSM attains a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on ImageNet, outperforming prior SSMs by 1%, reducing the KITTI-15 error rate to 2.77%, and improving eye-tracking detection rates by up to 0.33% with fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that dynamic scanning based on feature relationships significantly improves SSMs' representational power and efficiency, offering a versatile tool for various applications in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures, CVPR 2025 Camera Ready paper</p></details> |

Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p></details> | no comment |
| **[Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Quantum Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05336v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have revolutionized sequential learning across various domains, yet their self-attention mechanism incurs quadratic computational cost, posing limitations for real-time and resource-constrained tasks. To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art pre-trained foundation models, introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize them across several dimensions. Specifically, we classify models by their architecture design, distinguishing between those leveraging patch-based representations and those operating directly on raw sequences. The taxonomy further includes whether the models provide probabilistic or deterministic predictions, and whether they are designed to work with univariate time series or can handle multivariate time series out of the box. Additionally, the taxonomy encompasses model scale and complexity, highlighting differences between lightweight architectures and large-scale foundation models. A unique aspect of this survey is its categorization by the type of objective function employed during training phase. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and identifying promising directions for future research in transformer-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

We systematically reviewed papers published between 2005--2023 to identify key aspects of Stack Overflow that can affect study results, such as the language or context of code snippets. Our analysis reveals that certain aspects are non-stationary over time, which could lead to different conclusions if experiments are repeated at different times. We replicated six studies using a more recent dataset to demonstrate this risk. Our findings show that four papers produced significantly different results than the original findings, preventing the same conclusions from being drawn with a newer dataset version. Consequently, we recommend treating Stack Overflow as a time series data source to provide context for interpreting cross-sectional research conclusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding Time Series with LLMs: A Multi-Agent Framework for Cross-Domain Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17462v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous across various domains, including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures, 32 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Continual Learning Framework for Multivariate Time Series Prediction Tasks with Application to Vehicle State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01669v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</p></details> |  |

We highlight key design considerations for an analysis, including treatment and control group selection, timing of policy adoption, expected effect heterogeneity, and data considerations. We then provide an overview of analytic approaches and differentiate between methods based on evaluation context, such as settings with no control units, a single treated unit, multiple treated units, or with multiple treatment cohorts. Methods discussed include interrupted time series models, difference-in-differences estimators, autoregressive models, and synthetic control methods, along with method extensions which address issues like staggered policy adoption and heterogenous treatment effects. We end with an illustrative example, applying the developed framework to evaluate the impacts of state-level naloxone standing order policies on overdose rates. Overall, we provide researchers with an approach for deciding on methods for state policy evaluations, which can be used to select study designs and inform methodological choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03583v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Robustness: A Benchmarking Framework for Deep Learning Forecasting in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03494v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in domains such as manufacturing and energy distribution generate complex time series data crucial for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. We publicly release our robustness benchmark to encourage further research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifiability of VAR(1) model in a stationary setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03466v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a classical First-order Vector AutoRegressive (VAR(1)) model, where we interpret the autoregressive interaction matrix as influence relationships among the components of the VAR(1) process that can be encoded by a weighted directed graph. A majority of previous work studies the structural identifiability of the graph based on time series observations and therefore relies on dynamical information. In this work we assume that an equilibrium exists, and study instead the identifiability of the graph from the stationary distribution, meaning that we seek a way to reconstruct the influence graph underlying the dynamic network using only static information. We use an approach from algebraic statistics that characterizes models using the Jacobian matroids associated with the parametrization of the models, and we introduce sufficient graphical conditions under which different graphs yield distinct steady-state distributions. Additionally, we illustrate how our results could be applied to characterize networks inspired by ecological research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

However, the field faces challenges such as limited large-scale datasets and high data acquisition costs, which hinder the development of robust algorithms. Data augmentation techniques show promise in addressing these issues, but their application to biomechanical time-series data requires comprehensive evaluation. This scoping review investigates data augmentation methods for time-series data in the biomechanics domain. It analyzes current approaches for augmenting and generating time-series datasets, evaluates their effectiveness, and offers recommendations for applying these techniques in biomechanics. Four databases, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a two-stage screening identified 21 relevant publications. Results show that there is no universally preferred method for augmenting biomechanical time-series data; instead, methods vary based on study objectives. A major issue identified is the absence of soft tissue artifacts in synthetic data, leading to discrepancies referred to as the synthetic gap. Moreover, many studies lack proper evaluation of augmentation methods, making it difficult to assess their effects on model performance and data quality. This review highlights the critical role of data augmentation in addressing limited dataset availability and improving model generalization in biomechanics. Tailoring augmentation strategies to the characteristics of biomechanical data is essential for advancing predictive modeling. A better understanding of how different augmentation methods impact data quality and downstream tasks will be key to developing more effective and realistic techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at PLOS ONE</p></details> |
| **[Block Toeplitz Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation for Large-Scale Interval-Valued Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03322v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and forecasting interval-valued time series (ITS) have attracted considerable attention due to their growing presence in various contexts. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no efforts to model large-scale ITS. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction procedure for large-scale ITS, which involves key steps such as auto-segmentation and clustering, and feature transfer learning. This procedure can be seamlessly integrated with any suitable prediction models for forecasting purposes. Specifically, we transform the automatic segmentation and clustering of ITS into the estimation of Toeplitz sparse precision matrices and assignment set. The majorization-minimization algorithm is employed to convert this highly non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems. We derive efficient dynamic programming and alternating direction method to solve these two subproblems alternately and establish their convergence properties. By employing the Joint Recurrence Plot (JRP) to image subsequence and assigning a class label to each cluster, an image dataset is constructed. Then, an appropriate neural network is chosen to train on this image dataset and used to extract features for the next step of forecasting. Real data applications demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively obtain invariant representations of the raw data and enhance forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Classification of Interval-Valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03318v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the modeling and analysis of interval-valued time series have garnered significant attention in the fields of econometrics and statistics. However, the existing literature primarily focuses on regression tasks while neglecting classification aspects. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach for interval-valued time series classification. Specifically, we represent interval-valued time series using convex combinations of upper and lower bounds of intervals and transform these representations into images based on point-valued time series imaging methods. We utilize a fine-grained image classification neural network to classify these images, to achieve the goal of classifying the original interval-valued time series. This proposed method is applicable to both univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series. On the optimization front, we treat the convex combination coefficients as learnable parameters similar to the parameters of the neural network and provide an efficient estimation method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). On the theoretical front, under specific conditions, we establish a margin-based multiclass generalization bound for generic CNNs composed of basic blocks involving convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Through simulation studies and real data applications, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and compare its performance against a wide range of point-valued time series classification methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A model-free feature extraction procedure for interval-valued time series prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03310v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel feature extraction procedure to predict interval-valued time series by combing transfer learning and imaging approaches. Initially, we represent interval-valued time series using a bivariate point-valued time series, which serves as a representative form. We first transform each time series into images by employing various imaging approaches such as recurrence plot, gramian angular summation/difference field, and Markov transition field, and construct an image dataset by treating each imaging method's output as a separate class. Based on this dataset, we train several candidates for a feature extraction network (FEN), specifically ResNet with varying layers. Then we choose the penultimate layer of the FEN to extract the most relevant features from the transformed images. We integrate the extracted features into conventional predictive models to formulate the corresponding prediction models. To formulate prediction, we integrate the extracted features into a regular prediction model. The proposed methods are evaluated based on the S\&P 500 index and three data-generating processes (DGPs), and the experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement in prediction performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Robust Method for Fault Detection and Severity Estimation in Mechanical Vibration Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03229v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a robust method for fault detection and severity estimation in multivariate time-series data to enhance predictive maintenance of mechanical systems. We use the Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies among variables. This enables accurate future state predictions under varying operational conditions. To address the challenge of fluctuating anomaly scores that reduce fault severity estimation accuracy, we introduce a novel fault severity index based on the mean and standard deviation of anomaly scores. This generates a continuous and reliable severity measurement. We validate the proposed method using two experimental datasets: an open IMS bearing dataset and data collected from a fanjet electric propulsion system. Results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces abrupt fluctuations and inconsistencies in anomaly scores. This provides a more dependable foundation for maintenance planning and risk management in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

These findings establish theoretical foundations for future applications of personalized rehabilitation regimens, offering significant implications for the development of customized therapeutic interventions in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Water Mapping and Change Detection Using Time Series Derived from the Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03170v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the growing environmental challenges, accurate monitoring and prediction of changes in water bodies are essential for sustainable management and conservation. The Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) algorithm provides a valuable tool for real-time analysis of land changes, such as deforestation, urban expansion, agricultural activities, and natural disasters. This capability enables timely interventions and more informed decision-making. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the algorithm to estimate water bodies and track pixel-level water trends over time. Our findings indicate that COLD-derived data can reliably estimate estimate water frequency during stable periods and delineate water bodies. Furthermore, it enables the evaluation of trends in water areas after disturbances, allowing for the determination of whether water frequency increases, decreases, or remains constant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Network Modeling Techniques for Visualizing Human Mobility Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03119v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility analysis at urban-scale requires models to represent the complex nature of human movements, which in turn are affected by accessibility to nearby points of interest, underlying socioeconomic factors of a place, and local transport choices for people living in a geographic region. In this work, we represent human mobility and the associated flow of movements as a grapyh. Graph-based approaches for mobility analysis are still in their early stages of adoption and are actively being researched. The challenges of graph-based mobility analysis are multifaceted - the lack of sufficiently high-quality data to represent flows at high spatial and teporal resolution whereas, limited computational resources to translate large voluments of mobility data into a network structure, and scaling issues inherent in graph models etc. The current study develops a methodology by embedding graphs into a continuous space, which alleviates issues related to fast graph matching, graph time-series modeling, and visualization of mobility dynamics. Through experiments, we demonstrate how mobility data collected from taxicab trajectories could be transformed into network structures and patterns of mobility flow changes, and can be used for downstream tasks reporting approx 40% decrease in error on average in matched graphs vs unmatched ones.</p></details> |  |

The estimation of the latent model parameters is based on second-order properties of the count and underlying Gaussian time series, yielding estimators of the underlying covariance matrices for which standard principal component analysis applies. Theoretical consistency results are established for the proposed estimation, building on certain concentration results for the models of the type considered. They also involve the memory of the latent Gaussian process, quantified through a spectral gap, shown to be suitably bounded as the model dimension increases, which is of independent interest. In addition, novel cross-validation schemes are suggested for model selection. The forecasting is carried out through a particle-based sequential Monte Carlo, leveraging Kalman filtering techniques. A simulation study and an application are also considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating both statistical and machine-learning-based models for RUL estimation. Our approach transforms time-series battery data into time-to-failure data using path signatures, enabling effective survival modeling. We apply five models, including Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods such as DeepHit and MTLR, to estimate failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on 362 Toyota battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The proposed methodology provides actionable insights for battery manufacturers and engineers, supporting dynamic maintenance strategies and optimized lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |

This approach is pivotal in domains such as data centers, sensor networks, and finance. Traditional methods often struggle with manual parameter tuning and cannot adapt to new anomaly types. Our method overcomes these limitations by integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Active Learning. By incorporating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, our approach models sequential data and its dependencies effectively, allowing for the detection of new anomaly classes with minimal labeled data. Our innovative DRL- VAE and Active Learning combination significantly improves existing methods, as shown by our evaluations on real-world datasets, enhancing anomaly detection techniques and advancing time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A co-segmentation algorithm to predict emotional stress from passively sensed mHealth data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10558v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a data-driven co-segmentation algorithm of passively sensed and self-reported active variables collected through smartphones to identify emotionally stressful states in middle-aged and older patients with mood disorders undergoing therapy, some of whom also have chronic pain. Our method leverages the association between the different types of time series. These data are typically non-stationary, with meaningful associations often occurring only over short time windows. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods, when applied globally on the entire time series, often fail to capture these time-varying local patterns. Our approach first segments the passive sensing variables by detecting their change points, then examines segment-specific associations with the active variable to identify co-segmented periods that exhibit distinct relationships between stress and passively sensed measures. We then use these periods to predict future emotional stress states using standard ML methods. By shifting the unit of analysis from individual time points to data-driven segments of time and allowing for different associations in different segments, our algorithm helps detect patterns that only exist within short-time windows. We apply our method to detect periods of stress in patient data collected during ALACRITY Phase I study. Our findings indicate that the data-driven segmentation algorithm identifies stress periods more accurately than traditional ML methods that do not incorporate segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explanation Space: A New Perspective into Time Series Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01354v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human understandable explanation of deep learning models is essential for various critical and sensitive applications. Unlike image or tabular data where the importance of each input feature (for the classifier's decision) can be directly projected into the input, time series distinguishable features (e.g. dominant frequency) are often hard to manifest in time domain for a user to easily understand. Additionally, most explanation methods require a baseline value as an indication of the absence of any feature. However, the notion of lack of feature, which is often defined as black pixels for vision tasks or zero/mean values for tabular data, is not well-defined in time series. Despite the adoption of explainable AI methods (XAI) from tabular and vision domain into time series domain, these differences limit the application of these XAI methods in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that allows a model originally trained on the time domain to be interpreted in other explanation spaces using existing methods. We suggest five explanation spaces, each of which can potentially alleviate these issues in certain types of time series. Our method can be easily integrated into existing platforms without any changes to trained models or XAI methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA "on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 |

Frequently, this is done with item response theoretic (IRT) models that describe the relationship between those latent traits and observed indicators. We combine recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric IRT, which makes minimal assumptions on shapes of item response functions, and Gaussian process time series methods to capture dynamic structures in latent traits from longitudinal observations. We propose a generalized dynamic Gaussian process item response theory (GD-GPIRT) as well as a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for estimation of both latent traits and response functions. We evaluate GD-GPIRT in simulation studies against baselines in dynamic IRT, and apply it to various substantive studies, including assessing public opinions on economy environment and congressional ideology related to abortion debate.</p></details> |  |

Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |

However, in critical situations like predicting gaming overindulgence that affects one's mental well-being; an accurate forecast without a contributing evidence (explanation) is irrelevant. Hence, it becomes important that the forecasts are Interpretable - intermediate representation of the forecasted trajectory is comprehensible; as well as Explainable - attentive input features and events are accessible for a personalized and timely intervention of players at risk. While the contributing state of the art research on interpretability primarily focuses on temporally-smooth single-process driven time series data, our online multi-player gameplay data demonstrates intractable temporal randomness due to intrinsic orthogonality between player's game outcome and their intent to engage further. We introduce a novel deep Actionable Forecasting Network (AFN), which addresses the inter-dependent challenges associated with three exclusive objectives - 1) forecasting accuracy; 2) smooth comprehensible trajectory and 3) explanations via multi-dimensional input features while tackling the challenges introduced by our non-smooth temporal data, together in one single solution. AFN establishes a \it{new benchmark} via: (i) achieving 25% improvement on the MSE of the forecasts on player data in comparison to the SOM-VAE based SOTA networks; (ii) attributing unfavourable progression of a player's time series to a specific future time step(s), with the premise of eliminating near-future overindulgent player volume by over 18% with player specific actionable inputs feature(s) and (iii) proactively detecting over 23% (100% jump from SOTA) of the to-be overindulgent, players on an average, 4 weeks in advance.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are highly dependent on clean, high-quality inputs, making them susceptible to noise and real-world imperfections. Additionally, intricate temporal relationships in time series data are often inadequately captured in traditional 1D representations, leading to suboptimal modeling of dependencies. We introduce VISTA, a training-free, unsupervised TSAD algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. VISTA features three core modules: 1) Time Series Decomposition using Seasonal and Trend Decomposition via Loess (STL) to decompose noisy time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components; 2) Temporal Self-Attention, which transforms 1D time series into 2D temporal correlation matrices for richer dependency modeling and anomaly detection; and 3) Multivariate Temporal Aggregation, which uses a pretrained feature extractor to integrate cross-variable information into a unified, memory-efficient representation. VISTA's training-free approach enables rapid deployment and easy hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for industrial applications.

Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio.

| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/TGC-MTS.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal traffic time series, such as traffic speed data, collected from sensing systems are often incomplete, with considerable corruption and large amounts of missing values. A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Movement-Prediction-Adjusted Naïve Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469v7)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast, which is the original na\"ive forecast with the addition of a weighted movement prediction term, in the context of forecasting time series that exhibit symmetric random walk properties. The weight of the movement term is determined by two parameters: one reflecting the directional accuracy and the other representing the mean absolute increment. The settings of the two parameters involve a trade-off: larger values may yield meaningful gains over the original na\"ive forecast, whereas smaller values often render the adjusted forecast more reliable. This trade-off can be managed by empirically setting the parameters using sliding windows on in-sample data. To statistically test the performance of the adjusted na\"ive forecast under different directional accuracy levels, we used four synthetic time series to simulate multiple forecast scenarios, assuming that for each directional accuracy level, diverse movement predictions were provided. The simulation results show that as the directional accuracy increases, the error of the adjusted na\"ive forecast decreases. In particular, the adjusted na\"ive forecast achieves statistically significant improvements over the original na\"ive forecast, even under a low directional accuracy of slightly above 0.50. This finding implies that the movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast can serve as a new optimal point forecast for time series with symmetric random walk characteristics if consistent movement prediction can be provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastFlow: Early Yet Robust Network Flow Classification using the Minimal Number of Time-Series Packets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02174v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification is of great importance for network operators in their daily routines, such as analyzing the usage patterns of multimedia applications and optimizing network configurations. Internet service providers (ISPs) that operate high-speed links expect network flow classifiers to accurately classify flows early, using the minimal number of necessary initial packets per flow. These classifiers must also be robust to packet sequence disorders in candidate flows and capable of detecting unseen flow types that are not within the existing classification scope, which are not well achieved by existing methods. In this paper, we develop FastFlow, a time-series flow classification method that accurately classifies network flows as one of the known types or the unknown type, which dynamically selects the minimal number of packets to balance accuracy and efficiency. Toward the objectives, we first develop a flow representation process that converts packet streams at both per-packet and per-slot granularity for precise packet statistics with robustness to packet sequence disorders. Second, we develop a sequential decision-based classification model that leverages LSTM architecture trained with reinforcement learning. Our model makes dynamic decisions on the minimal number of time-series data points per flow for the confident classification as one of the known flow types or an unknown one. We evaluated our method on public datasets and demonstrated its superior performance in early and accurate flow classification. Deployment insights on the classification of over 22.9 million flows across seven application types and 33 content providers in a campus network over one week are discussed, showing that FastFlow requires an average of only 8.37 packets and 0.5 seconds to classify the application type of a flow with over 91% accuracy and over 96% accuracy for the content providers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025.

| **[Reducing Smoothness with Expressive Memory Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00349v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical forecasting models learn the structure of time series data via projecting onto a graph, with recent techniques capturing spatial-temporal associations between variables via edge weights. Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

| **[Niche Dynamics in Complex Online Community Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02153v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, conditionally accepted to ICWSM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Model Selection for Time Series Forecasting via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02119v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection is a critical step in time series forecasting, traditionally requiring extensive performance evaluations across various datasets. Meta-learning approaches aim to automate this process, but they typically depend on pre-constructed performance matrices, which are costly to build. In this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lightweight alternative for model selection. Our method eliminates the need for explicit performance matrices by utilizing the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA, GPT and Gemini, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional meta-learning techniques and heuristic baselines, while significantly reducing computational overhead. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in efficient model selection for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 Figures |

Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

In addition, we introduce the shaprpy Python library, which brings core capabilities of shapr to the Python ecosystem. Overall, the package aims to enhance the interpretability of predictive models within a powerful and user-friendly framework.</p></details> |  |

The inference relies on time-delay embedding, estimation of the intrinsic dimension of the observed systems, and their mutual dimension. A key component of our approach is a new anisotropic training technique applied to Kohonen's self-organizing map, which effectively learns the attractor of the driven system and separates it into submanifolds corresponding to the self-dynamics and shared dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted simulated experiments using different chaotic maps in a setup, where two chaotic maps were driven by a third map with nonlinear coupling. The inferred time series exhibited high correlation with the time series of the actual hidden common driver, in contrast to the observed systems. The quality of our reconstruction were compared and shown to be superior to several other methods that are intended to find the common features behind the observed time series, including linear methods like PCA and ICA as well as nonlinear methods like dynamical component analysis, canonical correlation analysis and even deep canonical correlation analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLaP -- State Detection from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01783v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the environment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series (TS). These recordings encode the recognizable properties of latent states and transitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes. The unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their transitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state or not. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 391 TS from four benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states than five state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of CLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.

We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges.

This work presents clustering approaches for functional time series that combine the fuzzy $C$-medoids and fuzzy $C$-means procedures with a novel dissimilarity measure tailored for functional data. This dissimilarity is based on an extension of the quantile autocorrelation to the functional context.

This is especially the case for physiological time series, which are both noisy and scarce, which calls for data augmentation to artificially increase the size of datasets. Another issue is that the time-evolving statistical properties of nonstationary signals prevent the use of standard data augmentation techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel method for augmenting nonstationary time series. This is achieved by combining offline changepoint detection with the iterative amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (iAAFT), which ensures that the time-frequency properties of the original signal are preserved during augmentation. The proposed method is validated through comparisons of the performance of i) a deep learning seizure detection algorithm on both the original and augmented versions of the CHB-MIT and Siena scalp electroencephalography (EEG) databases, and ii) a deep learning atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm on the original and augmented versions of the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset. By virtue of the proposed method, for the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets respectively, accuracy rose by 4.4% and 1.9%, precision by 10% and 5.5%, recall by 3.6% and 0.9%, and F1 by 4.2% and 1.4%. For the AF classification task, accuracy rose by 0.3%, precision by 2.1%, recall by 0.8%, and F1 by 2.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

The core challenge lies in effectively modeling dependencies both within sequences and channels. Convolutional Neural Networks and Linear models often excel in sequence modeling but frequently fall short in capturing complex channel dependencies. In contrast, Transformer-based models, with their attention mechanisms applied to both sequences and channels, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. Our research proposes a new approach for capturing sequence and channel dependencies: AverageTime, an exceptionally simple yet effective structure. By employing mixed channel embedding and averaging operations, AverageTime separately captures correlations for sequences and channels through channel mapping and result averaging. In addition, we integrate clustering methods to further accelerate the model's training process. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AverageTime surpasses state-of-the-art models in predictive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to lightweight linear models. This provides a new and effective framework for modeling long time series.</p></details> |  |

Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |

Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that offers broad applicability similar to MLP while effectively addressing periodicity modeling challenges. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach maintains the general-purpose modeling capability. Therefore, FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various model architectures with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, e.g., symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, language modeling, and image recognition.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out.

Despite significant progress, it becomes challenging in the presence of noise, especially when derivatives need to be calculated. To reduce the effect of noise, we propose a method that simultaneously fits both the derivative and trajectory from noisy time-series data. Our approach formulates derivative estimation as an inverse problem involving integral operators within the forward model, and estimates the derivative function by solving a regularization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS). We derive an integral-form representer theorem, which enables the computation of the regularized solution by solving a finite-dimensional problem and facilitates efficiently estimating the optimal regularization parameter. By embedding the dynamics within a vRKHS and utilizing the fitted derivative and trajectory, we can recover the underlying dynamics from noisy data by solving a linear regularization problem. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression with Equality Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17848v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for symbolic regression models with genetic programming (GP) has a tendency of revisiting expressions in their original or equivalent forms. Repeatedly evaluating equivalent expressions is inefficient, as it does not immediately lead to better solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms require diversity and should allow the accumulation of inactive building blocks that can play an important role at a later point. The equality graph is a data structure capable of compactly storing expressions and their equivalent forms allowing an efficient verification of whether an expression has been visited in any of their stored equivalent forms. We exploit the e-graph to adapt the subtree operators to reduce the chances of revisiting expressions. Our adaptation, called eggp, stores every visited expression in the e-graph, allowing us to filter out from the available selection of subtrees all the combinations that would create already visited expressions. Results show that, for small expressions, this approach improves the performance of a simple GP algorithm to compete with PySR and Operon without increasing computational cost. As a highlight, eggp was capable of reliably delivering short and at the same time accurate models for a selected set of benchmarks from SRBench and a set of real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

Symbolic regression (SR) automates the search for non-linear regression models, delivering a set of hypotheses that balances accuracy with the possibility to understand the phenomena. Many SR implementations return a Pareto front allowing the choice of the best trade-off. However, this hides alternatives that are close to non-domination, limiting these choices. Equality graphs (e-graphs) allow to represent large sets of expressions compactly by efficiently handling duplicated parts occurring in multiple expressions. E-graphs allow to store and query all SR solution candidates visited in one or multiple GP runs efficiently and open the possibility to analyse much larger sets of SR solution candidates. We introduce rEGGression, a tool using e-graphs to enable the exploration of a large set of symbolic expressions which provides querying, filtering, and pattern matching features creating an interactive experience to gain insights about SR models. The main highlight is its focus in the exploration of the building blocks found during the search that can help the experts to find insights about the studied phenomena.This is possible by exploiting the pattern matching capability of the e-graph data structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

We combine principles from Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Universal Design (UD) with symbolic communication strategies to facilitate the alignment of mental models between humans and robots. Our approach employs Asterics Grid and ARASAAC pictograms as a multimodal, interpretable front-end, integrated with a lightweight HTTP-to-ROS 2 bridge that enables real-time interaction and explanation triggering. We emphasize that explainability is not a one-way function but a bidirectional process, where human understanding and robot transparency must co-evolve. We further argue that in educational or assistive contexts, the role of a human mediator (e.g., a teacher) may be essential to support shared understanding. We validate our framework with examples of multimodal explanation boards and discuss how it can be extended to different scenarios in education, assistive robotics, and inclusive AI.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Interpretable Non-linear Survival Analysis with Evolutionary Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05756v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival Regression (SuR) is a key technique for modeling time to event in important applications such as clinical trials and semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, SuR algorithms belong to one of three classes: non-linear black-box -- allowing adaptability to many datasets but offering limited interpretability (e.g., tree ensembles); linear glass-box -- being easier to interpret but limited to modeling only linear interactions (e.g., Cox proportional hazards); and non-linear glass-box -- allowing adaptability and interpretability, but empirically found to have several limitations (e.g., explainable boosting machines, survival trees). In this work, we investigate whether Symbolic Regression (SR), i.e., the automated search of mathematical expressions from data, can lead to non-linear glass-box survival models that are interpretable and accurate. We propose an evolutionary, multi-objective, and multi-expression implementation of SR adapted to SuR. Our empirical results on five real-world datasets show that SR consistently outperforms traditional glass-box methods for SuR in terms of accuracy per number of dimensions in the model, while exhibiting comparable accuracy with black-box methods. Furthermore, we offer qualitative examples to assess the interpretability potential of SR models for SuR. Code at: https://github.com/lurovi/SurvivalMultiTree-pyNSGP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rediscovering Hyperelasticity by Deep Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05387v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate modeling of the mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials under multi-axial loading constitutes a long-standing challenge in hyperelastic material modeling. This work employs deep symbolic regression as an interpretable machine learning approach to discover novel strain energy functions directly from experimental results, with a specific focus on the classical Treloar and Kawabata data sets for vulcanized rubber. The proposed approach circumvents traditional human model selection biases by exploring possible functional forms of strain energy functions, expressed in terms of both the first and second principal invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. The resulting models exhibit high predictive accuracy for various deformation modes, including uniaxial tension, pure shear, equal biaxial tension, and biaxial loading. This work underscores the potential of deep symbolic regression in advancing hyperelastic material modeling and highlights the importance of considering both invariants in capturing the complex behaviors of rubber-like materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[BoolE: Exact Symbolic Reasoning via Boolean Equality Saturation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05577v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean symbolic reasoning for gate-level netlists is a critical step in verification, logic and datapath synthesis, and hardware security. Specifically, reasoning datapath and adder tree in bit-blasted Boolean networks is particularly crucial for verification and synthesis, and challenging. Conventional approaches either fail to accurately (exactly) identify the function blocks of the designs in gate-level netlist with structural hashing and symbolic propagation, or their reasoning performance is highly sensitive to structure modifications caused by technology mapping or logic optimization. This paper introduces BoolE, an exact symbolic reasoning framework for Boolean netlists using equality saturation. BoolE optimizes scalability and performance by integrating domain-specific Boolean ruleset for term rewriting. We incorporate a novel extraction algorithm into BoolE to enhance its structural insight and computational efficiency, which adeptly identifies and captures multi-input, multi-output high-level structures (e.g., full adder) in the reconstructed e-graph. Our experiments show that BoolE surpasses state-of-the-art symbolic reasoning baselines, including the conventional functional approach (ABC) and machine learning-based method (Gamora). Specifically, we evaluated its performance on various multiplier architecture with different configurations. Our results show that BoolE identifies $3.53\times$ and $3.01\times$ more exact full adders than ABC in carry-save array and Booth-encoded multipliers, respectively. Additionally, we integrated BoolE into multiplier formal verification tasks, where it significantly accelerates the performance of traditional formal verification tools using computer algebra, demonstrated over four orders of magnitude runtime improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lemmanaid: Neuro-Symbolic Lemma Conjecturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04942v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Our results indicate that neural and symbolic techniques are complementary. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review on Symbolic Regression in Power Systems: Methods, Applications, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04621v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As power systems evolve with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources and smart grid technologies, there is a growing demand for flexible and scalable modeling approaches capable of capturing the complex dynamics of modern grids. This review focuses on symbolic regression, a powerful methodology for deriving parsimonious and interpretable mathematical models directly from data. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of symbolic regression methods, including sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, automatic regression for governing equations, and deep symbolic regression, highlighting their applications in power systems. Through comparative case studies of the single machine infinite bus system, grid-following, and grid-forming inverter, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and suitability of each symbolic regression method in modeling nonlinear power system dynamics. Additionally, we identify critical research gaps and discuss future directions for leveraging symbolic regression in the optimization, control, and operation of modern power grids. This review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and engineers seeking innovative, data-driven solutions for modeling in the context of evolving power system infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Planning for Complex Tasks with Knowledge Graph-RAG and Symbolic Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04578v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as robotic planners but often struggle with long-horizon and complex tasks, especially in specialized environments requiring external knowledge. While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Cox Proportional Hazards Model with Symbolic Non-Linear Log-Risk Functions for Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04353v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model has been widely applied in survival analysis to estimate relative risks across different subjects given multiple covariates. Traditional CPH models rely on a linear combination of covariates weighted with coefficients as the log-risk function, which imposes a strong and restrictive assumption, limiting generalization. Recent deep learning methods enable non-linear log-risk functions. However, they often lack interpretability due to the end-to-end training mechanisms. The implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offers new possibilities for extending the CPH model with fully transparent and symbolic non-linear log-risk functions. In this paper, we introduce Generalized Cox Proportional Hazards (GCPH) model, a novel method for survival analysis that leverages KAN to enable a non-linear mapping from covariates to survival outcomes in a fully symbolic manner. GCPH maintains the interpretability of traditional CPH models while allowing for the estimation of non-linear log-risk functions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and various public benchmarks demonstrate that GCPH achieves competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits superior interpretability compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Currently, we are in the third AI summer, characterized by significant advancements and commercialization, particularly in the integration of Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic AI, leading to the emergence of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Methods: The review followed the PRISMA methodology, utilizing databases such as IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM, and SpringerLink. The inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers were screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based on the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility. Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The majority of research efforts are concentrated in the areas of learning and inference (63%), logic and reasoning (35%), and knowledge representation (44%). Explainability and trustworthiness are less represented (28%), with Meta-Cognition being the least explored area (5%). The review identifies significant interdisciplinary opportunities, particularly in integrating explainability and trustworthiness with other research areas. Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI research has seen rapid growth since 2020, with concentrated efforts in learning and inference. Significant gaps remain in explainability, trustworthiness, and Meta-Cognition. Addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary research will be crucial for advancing the field towards more intelligent, reliable, and context-aware AI systems.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Tratto: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Deriving Axiomatic Test Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04251v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Tratto, a neuro-symbolic approach that generates assertions (boolean expressions) that can serve as axiomatic oracles, from source code and documentation. The symbolic module of Tratto takes advantage of the grammar of the programming language, the unit under test, and the context of the unit (its class and available APIs) to restrict the search space of the tokens that can be successfully used to generate valid oracles. The neural module of Tratto uses transformers fine-tuned for both deciding whether to output an oracle or not and selecting the next lexical token to incrementally build the oracle from the set of tokens returned by the symbolic module. Our experiments show that Tratto outperforms the state-of-the-art axiomatic oracle generation approaches, with 73% accuracy, 72% precision, and 61% F1-score, largely higher than the best results of the symbolic and neural approaches considered in our study (61%, 62%, and 37%, respectively). Tratto can generate three times more axiomatic oracles than current symbolic approaches, while generating 10 times less false positives than GPT4 complemented with few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ISSTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[PEIRCE: Unifying Material and Formal Reasoning via LLM-Driven Neuro-Symbolic Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04110v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A persistent challenge in AI is the effective integration of material and formal inference - the former concerning the plausibility and contextual relevance of arguments, while the latter focusing on their logical and structural validity. Large Language Models (LLMs), by virtue of their extensive pre-training on large textual corpora, exhibit strong capabilities in material inference. However, their reasoning often lacks formal rigour and verifiability. At the same time, LLMs' linguistic competence positions them as a promising bridge between natural and formal languages, opening up new opportunities for combining these two modes of reasoning. In this paper, we introduce PEIRCE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to unify material and formal inference through an iterative conjecture-criticism process. Within this framework, LLMs play the central role of generating candidate solutions in natural and formal languages, which are then evaluated and refined via interaction with external critique models. These critiques include symbolic provers, which assess formal validity, as well as soft evaluators that measure the quality of the generated arguments along linguistic and epistemic dimensions such as plausibility, coherence, and parsimony. While PEIRCE is a general-purpose framework, we demonstrate its capabilities in the domain of natural language explanation generation - a setting that inherently demands both material adequacy and formal correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo paper.

Using eight datasets representative of one especially sensitive industry, nuclear power, this work compares a traditional feedforward neural network (FNN) to a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). We consider not only model performance and accuracy, but also interpretability through model architecture and explainability through a post-hoc SHAP analysis. In terms of accuracy, we find KANs and FNNs comparable across all datasets, when output dimensionality is limited. KANs, which transform into symbolic equations after training, yield perfectly interpretable models while FNNs remain black-boxes. Finally, using the post-hoc explainability results from Kernel SHAP, we find that KANs learn real, physical relations from experimental data, while FNNs simply produce statistically accurate results. Overall, this analysis finds KANs a promising alternative to traditional machine learning methods, particularly in applications requiring both accuracy and comprehensibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 11 Figures, 14 Tables</p></details> |
| **[An Extended Symbolic-Arithmetic Model for Teaching Double-Black Removal with Rotation in Red-Black Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03259v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Double-black (DB) nodes have no place in red-black (RB) trees. So when DB nodes are formed, they are immediately removed. The removal of DB nodes that cause rotation and recoloring of other connected nodes poses greater challenges in the teaching and learning of RB trees. To ease this difficulty, this paper extends our previous work on the symbolic arithmetic algebraic (SA) method for removing DB nodes. The SA operations that are given as, Red + Black = Black; Black - Black = Red; Black + Black = DB; and DB - Black = Black removes DB nodes and rebalances black heights in RB trees. By extension, this paper projects three SA mathematical equations, namely, general symbolic arithmetic rule; partial symbolic arithmetic rule1; and partial symbolic arithmetic rule2. The removal of a DB node ultimately affects black heights in RB trees. To balance black heights using the SA equations, all the RB tree cases, namely, LR, RL, LL, and RR, were considered in this work; and the position of the nodes connected directly or indirectly to the DB node was also tested. In this study, to balance a RB tree, the issues considered w.r.t. the different cases of the RB tree were i) whether a DB node has an inner, outer, or both inner and outer black nephews; or ii) whether a DB node has an inner, outer or both inner and outer red nephews. The nephews r and x in this work are the children of the sibling s to a DB, and further up the tree, the parent p of a DB is their grandparent g. Thus, r and x have indirect relationships to a DB at the point of formation of the DB node. The novelty of the SA equations is in their effectiveness in the removal of DB that involves rotation of nodes as well as the recoloring of nodes along any simple path so as to balance black heights in a tree.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00773v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI.

We introduce SymDQN, a novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent. The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Recent progress in Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) shows promise in expediting this process. However, the formal corpora available on the Internet are limited compared to the general text, posing a significant data scarcity challenge for NTP. To address this issue, this work proposes Alchemy, a general framework for data synthesis that constructs formal theorems through symbolic mutation. Specifically, for each candidate theorem in Mathlib, we identify all invocable theorems that can be used to rewrite or apply to it. Subsequently, we mutate the candidate theorem by replacing the corresponding term in the statement with its equivalent form or antecedent. As a result, our method increases the number of theorems in Mathlib by an order of magnitude, from 110k to 6M. Furthermore, we perform continual pretraining and supervised finetuning on this augmented corpus for large language models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a 4.70% absolute performance improvement on Leandojo benchmark. Additionally, our approach achieves a 2.47% absolute performance gain on the out-of-distribution miniF2F benchmark based on the synthetic data.To provide further insights, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of synthetic data composition and the training paradigm, offering valuable guidance for developing a strong theorem prover.</p></details> |  |

| **[Proposition of Affordance-Driven Environment Recognition Framework Using Symbol Networks in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01644v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the quest to enable robots to coexist with humans, understanding dynamic situations and selecting appropriate actions based on common sense and affordances are essential. Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.</p></details> |  |

ArchCAD-400K boasts an extended drawing diversity and broader categories, offering line-grained annotations. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model for panoptic symbol spotting, termed Dual-Pathway Symbol Spotter (DPSS). It incorporates an adaptive fusion module to enhance primitive features with complementary image features, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness.

| **[Towards Responsible and Trustworthy Educational Data Mining: Comparing Symbolic, Sub-Symbolic, and Neural-Symbolic AI Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00615v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the demand for responsible and trustworthy AI for education, this study evaluates symbolic, sub-symbolic, and neural-symbolic AI (NSAI) in terms of generalizability and interpretability. Our extensive experiments on balanced and imbalanced self-regulated learning datasets of Estonian primary school students predicting 7th-grade mathematics national test performance showed that symbolic and sub-symbolic methods performed well on balanced data but struggled to identify low performers in imbalanced datasets. Interestingly, symbolic and sub-symbolic methods emphasized different factors in their decision-making: symbolic approaches primarily relied on cognitive and motivational factors, while sub-symbolic methods focused more on cognitive aspects, learned knowledge, and the demographic variable of gender -- yet both largely overlooked metacognitive factors. The NSAI method, on the other hand, showed advantages by: (i) being more generalizable across both classes -- even in imbalanced datasets -- as its symbolic knowledge component compensated for the underrepresented class; and (ii) relying on a more integrated set of factors in its decision-making, including motivation, (meta)cognition, and learned knowledge, thus offering a comprehensive and theoretically grounded interpretability framework. These contrasting findings highlight the need for a holistic comparison of AI methods before drawing conclusions based solely on predictive performance. They also underscore the potential of hybrid, human-centered NSAI methods to address the limitations of other AI families and move us closer to responsible AI for education. Specifically, by enabling stakeholders to contribute to AI design, NSAI aligns learned patterns with theoretical constructs, incorporates factors like motivation and metacognition, and strengthens the trustworthiness and responsibility of educational data mining.</p></details> |  |

Holonomic and nonholonomic constraints affecting the kinematic behavior is investigated in order to develop control-oriented kinematic models representative of these peculiarities. Then, the structure of these constraints is exploited to develop an iterative algorithm to symbolically derive yaw-plane kinematic models of generalized $n$-trailer articulated vehicles with an arbitrary number of multi-axle vehicle units. A formal proof is provided for the maximum number of kinematic controls admissible to a large-scale generalized articulated vehicle system, which leads to a generalized Ackermann steering law for $n$-trailer systems. Moreover, kinematic data collected from a test vehicle is used to validate the kinematic models and, to understand the rearward yaw rate amplification behavior of the vehicle pulling multiple simulated trailers.</p></details> |  |

The primary use case for cozy is validating "micropatches": small binary or assembly-level patches inserted into existing compiled binaries. To perform this task, cozy leverages the Python-based angr symbolic execution framework. Our tool analyzes the output of symbolic execution to find end states for the pre- and post-patched binaries that are compatible (reachable from the same input). The tool then compares compatible states for observable differences in registers, memory, and side effects. To aid in usability, cozy comes with a web-based visual interface for viewing comparison results. This interface provides a rich set of operations for pruning, filtering, and exploring different types of program data.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of the Workshop on Binary Analysis Research (BAR) 2025, winner of the BAR 2025 distinguished paper award</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Accurate Task Planning using Neuro-Symbolic Language Models and Multi-level Goal Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19250v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotic task planning, symbolic planners using rule-based representations like PDDL are effective but struggle with long-sequential tasks in complicated environments due to exponentially increasing search space. Meanwhile, LLM-based approaches, which are grounded in artificial neural networks, offer faster inference and commonsense reasoning but suffer from lower success rates. To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks. Our method significantly reduces planning time while maintaining high success rates across task planning domains, as well as real-world and simulated robotics environments. More details are available at http://graphics.ewha.ac.kr/LLMTAMP/.</p></details> |  |

However, applying counterfactual methods to time series models remains challenging due to temporal dependencies, high dimensionality, and the lack of an intuitive human-interpretable representation. We introduce MASCOTS, a method that leverages the Bag-of-Receptive-Fields representation alongside symbolic transformations inspired by Symbolic Aggregate Approximation. By operating in a symbolic feature space, it enhances interpretability while preserving fidelity to the original data and model. Unlike existing approaches that either depend on model structure or autoencoder-based sampling, MASCOTS directly generates meaningful and diverse counterfactual observations in a model-agnostic manner, operating on both univariate and multivariate data. We evaluate MASCOTS on univariate and multivariate benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable validity, proximity, and plausibility to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly improving interpretability and sparsity. Its symbolic nature allows for explanations that can be expressed visually, in natural language, or through semantic representations, making counterfactual reasoning more accessible and actionable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21406v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Automated reasoning, encompassing formal logic, theorem proving, model checking, and symbolic analysis, provides a foundational framework for verifying security properties across diverse domains such as access control, protocol design, vulnerability detection, and adversarial modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the role of automated reasoning in cybersecurity, analyzing how logical systems, including temporal, deontic, and epistemic logics are employed to formalize and verify security guarantees. We examine SOTA tools and frameworks, explore integrations with AI for neural-symbolic reasoning, and highlight critical research gaps, particularly in scalability, compositionality, and multi-layered security modeling. The paper concludes with a set of well-grounded future research directions, aiming to foster the development of secure systems through formal, automated, and explainable reasoning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20425v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[New constructions of MDS symbol-pair codes via simple-root cyclic codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20137v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern storage technologies, symbol-pair codes have emerged as a crucial framework for addressing errors in channels where symbols are read in overlapping pairs to guard against pair errors. A symbol-pair code that meets the Singleton-type bound is called a maximum distance separable (MDS) symbol-pair code. MDS symbol-pair codes are optimal in the sense that they have the highest pair error-correcting capability. In this paper, we focus on new constructions of MDS symbol-pair codes using simple-root cyclic codes. Specifically, three new infinite families of $(n, d_P)_q$-MDS symbol-pair codes are obtained: (1) $(n=4q+4,d_P=7)_q$ for $q\equiv 1\pmod 4$; (2) $(n=4q-4,d_P=8)_q$ for $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$; (3) $(n=2q+2,d_P=9)_q$ for $q$ being an odd prime power. The first two constructions are based on analyzing the solutions of certain equations over finite fields. The third construction arises from the decomposition of cyclic codes, where we utilize the orthogonal relationships between component codes and their duals to rigorously exclude the presence of specific codewords. It is worth noting that for the pair distance $d_P=7$ or $8$, our $q$-ary MDS symbol-pair codes achieve the longest known code length when $q$ is not a prime. Furthermore, for $d_P=9$, our codes attain the longest code length regardless of whether $q$ is prime or not.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Probabilistic Neuro-symbolic Layer for Algebraic Constraint Satisfaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19466v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Symbolic Regression with Quality-Diversity and Physics-Inspired Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19043v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents QDSR, an advanced symbolic Regression (SR) system that integrates genetic programming (GP), a quality-diversity (QD) algorithm, and a dimensional analysis (DA) engine. Our method focuses on exact symbolic recovery of known expressions from datasets, with a particular emphasis on the Feynman-AI benchmark. On this widely used collection of 117 physics equations, QDSR achieves an exact recovery rate of 91.6~$\%$, surpassing all previous SR methods by over 20 percentage points. Our method also exhibits strong robustness to noise. Beyond QD and DA, this high success rate results from a profitable trade-off between vocabulary expressiveness and search space size: we show that significantly expanding the vocabulary with precomputed meaningful variables (e.g., dimensionless combinations and well-chosen scalar products) often reduces equation complexity, ultimately leading to better performance. Ablation studies will also show that QD alone already outperforms the state-of-the-art. This suggests that a simple integration of QD, by projecting individuals onto a QD grid, can significantly boost performance in existing algorithms, without requiring major system overhauls.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Journal of Machine Learning research</p></details> |

The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%). The code will be released soon.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Neuro-symbolic Weak Supervision: Theory and Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18509v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak supervision allows machine learning models to learn from limited or noisy labels, but it introduces challenges in interpretability and reliability - particularly in multi-instance partial label learning (MI-PLL), where models must resolve both ambiguous labels and uncertain instance-label mappings. We propose a semantics for neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to improve MI-PLL by providing structured relational constraints that guide learning. Within our semantic characterization, ILP defines a logical hypothesis space for label transitions, clarifies classifier semantics, and establishes interpretable performance standards. This hybrid approach improves robustness, transparency, and accountability in weakly supervised settings, ensuring neural predictions align with domain knowledge. By embedding weak supervision into a logical framework, we enhance both interpretability and learning, making weak supervision more suitable for real-world, high-stakes applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study on Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence: Healthcare Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18213v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) scientists have been conducting investigations to attain human-level performance by a machine in accomplishing a cognitive task. Within machine learning, the ultimate aspiration is to attain Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a machine. This pursuit has led to the exploration of two distinct AI paradigms. Symbolic AI, also known as classical or GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) and Connectionist (Sub-symbolic) AI, represented by Neural Systems, are two mutually exclusive paradigms. Symbolic AI excels in reasoning, explainability, and knowledge representation but faces challenges in processing complex real-world data with noise. Conversely, deep learning (Black-Box systems) research breakthroughs in neural networks are notable, yet they lack reasoning and interpretability. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), an emerging area of AI research, attempts to bridge this gap by integrating logical reasoning into neural networks, enabling them to learn and reason with symbolic representations. While a long path, this strategy has made significant progress towards achieving common sense reasoning by systems. This article conducts an extensive review of over 977 studies from prominent scientific databases (DBLP, ACL, IEEExplore, Scopus, PubMed, ICML, ICLR), thoroughly examining the multifaceted capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular focus on its healthcare applications, particularly in drug discovery, and Protein engineering research. The survey addresses vital themes, including reasoning, explainability, integration strategies, 41 healthcare-related use cases, benchmarking, datasets, current approach limitations from both healthcare and broader perspectives, and proposed novel approaches for future experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages |

While these approaches achieve high-quality results, they require substantial computational resources, limiting their scalability. We introduce LZMidi, a lightweight symbolic music generation framework based on a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78)-induced sequential probability assignment (SPA). By leveraging the discrete and sequential structure of MIDI data, our approach enables efficient music generation on standard CPUs with minimal training and inference costs. Theoretically, we establish universal convergence guarantees for our approach, underscoring its reliability and robustness. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models, LZMidi achieves competitive Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), Wasserstein Distance (WD), and Kullback-Leibler (KL) scores, while significantly reducing computational overhead - up to 30x faster training and 300x faster generation. Our results position LZMidi as a significant advancement in compression-based learning, highlighting how universal compression techniques can efficiently model and generate structured sequential data, such as symbolic music, with practical scalability and theoretical rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-Feasible Reactive Synthesis for Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion via Trajectory Optimization and Symbolic Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03071v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Scene Graph Conditioning for Synthetic Image Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17224v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models increase in scale and complexity, obtaining sufficient training data has become a critical bottleneck due to acquisition costs, privacy constraints, and data scarcity in specialised domains. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative, a notable performance gap remains compared to models trained on real data, particularly as task complexity grows. Concurrently, Neuro-Symbolic methods, which combine neural networks' learning strengths with symbolic reasoning's structured representations, have demonstrated significant potential across various cognitive tasks. This paper explores the utility of Neuro-Symbolic conditioning for synthetic image dataset generation, focusing specifically on improving the performance of Scene Graph Generation models. The research investigates whether structured symbolic representations in the form of scene graphs can enhance synthetic data quality through explicit encoding of relational constraints. The results demonstrate that Neuro-Symbolic conditioning yields significant improvements of up to +2.59% in standard Recall metrics and +2.83% in No Graph Constraint Recall metrics when used for dataset augmentation. These findings establish that merging Neuro-Symbolic and generative approaches produces synthetic data with complementary structural information that enhances model performance when combined with real data, providing a novel approach to overcome data scarcity limitations even for complex visual reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music in ABC notation, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Audio Classification via Modal Decision Tree Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17018v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The range of potential applications of acoustic analysis is wide. Classification of sounds, in particular, is a typical machine learning task that received a lot of attention in recent years. The most common approaches to sound classification are sub-symbolic, typically based on neural networks, and result in black-box models with high performances but very low transparency. In this work, we consider several audio tasks, namely, age and gender recognition, emotion classification, and respiratory disease diagnosis, and we approach them with a symbolic technique, that is, (modal) decision tree learning. We prove that such tasks can be solved using the same symbolic pipeline, that allows to extract simple rules with very high accuracy and low complexity. In principle, all such tasks could be associated to an autonomous conversation system, which could be useful in different contexts, such as an automatic reservation agent for an hospital or a clinic.</p></details> |  |

We show that the learnability of NeSy tasks can be characterized by their derived constraint satisfaction problems (DCSPs). Specifically, a task is learnable if the corresponding DCSP has a unique solution; otherwise, it is unlearnable. For learnable tasks, we establish error bounds by exploiting the clustering property of the hypothesis space. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic error for general NeSy tasks, showing that the expected error scales with the disagreement among solutions. Our results offer a principled approach to determining learnability and provide insights into the design of new algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextGPT: Infusing LLMs Knowledge into Neuro-Symbolic Activity Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06586v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a hot research area in mobile computing, and the most effective solutions in the literature are based on supervised deep learning models. However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise. An extensive evaluation carried out on two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-based Wireless Symbol Detection Over Fading Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16594v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts without model update. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose the DEcision Feedback INcontExt Detection (DEFINED) solution as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. Furthermore, we proposed another detection method where we combine ICL with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) to extract information from both labeled and unlabeled data during inference, thus avoiding the errors propagated during the decision feedback process of the original DEFINED. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless communication settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED or IC-SSL achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance of the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.07600</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Symbolic Execution of Software under Fault Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15825v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a symbolic method for analyzing the safety of software under fault attacks both accurately and efficiently. Fault attacks leverage physically injected hardware faults to break the safety of a software program. While there are existing methods for analyzing the impact of faults on software, they suffer from inaccurate fault modeling and inefficient analysis algorithms. We propose two new techniques to overcome these problems. First, we propose a fault modeling technique that leverages program transformation to add symbolic variables to the program, to accurately model the fault-induced program behavior. Second, we propose a redundancy pruning technique that leverages the weakest precondition and fault saturation to mitigate path explosion, which is a performance bottleneck of symbolic execution that is exacerbated by the fault-induced program behavior. We have implemented the method and evaluated it on a variety of benchmark programs. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, it not only reveals many previously-missed safety violations but also reduces the running time drastically. Compared to the baseline, our optimized method is 2.0$\times$ faster on average.</p></details> |  |

For symbolic regression problems, variants that use an epsilon-threshold or batches of training cases, among others, have led to performance improvements. Lately, especially variants that combine lexicase selection and down-sampling strategies have received a lot of attention. This paper evaluates the most relevant lexicase-based selection methods as well as traditional selection methods in combination with different down-sampling strategies on a wide range of symbolic regression problems. In contrast to most work, we not only compare the methods over a given evaluation budget, but also over a given time budget as time is usually limited in practice. We find that for a given evaluation budget, epsilon-lexicase selection in combination with a down-sampling strategy outperforms all other methods. If the given running time is very short, lexicase variants using batches of training cases perform best. Further, we find that the combination of tournament selection with informed down-sampling performs well in all studied settings.</p></details> |  |

Although gaps can sometimes be narrowed by techniques such as refinement, a verified program's trusted computing base may still include compilers and inlined assembly. In contrast, verification of binaries following an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) such as RISC-V can ensure that machine code behaves as expected on real hardware. While binary analysis is useful and sometimes even necessary for ensuring trustworthiness of software systems, existing tools do not have a formal foundation or lack automation for verification. We present a workflow and toolchain based on the HOL4 theorem prover and the HolBA binary analysis library for trustworthy formal verification of RISC-V binaries. The toolchain automates proofs of binary contracts by forward symbolic execution of programs in HolBA's intermediate language, BIR.

We propose a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones. Furthermore, the proposed metrics are consistent with human evaluations.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Traditionally, sperm whale populations are categorized into clans based on their vocal repertoire: the rhythmically patterned click sequences (codas) that they use. Among these codas, identity codas function as symbolic markers for each clan, accounting for 35-60% of codas they produce. We introduce a computational method to model whale speech, which encodes rhythmic micro-variations within codas, capturing their vocal style. We find that vocal style-clans closely align with repertoire-clans. However, contrary to vocal repertoire, we show that sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, i.e. most codas, suggesting social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, this subcoda structure model offers a framework for comparing communication systems in other species, with potential implications for deeper understanding of vocal and cultural transmission within animal societies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Summation of Multivariate Rational Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06968v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic summation as an active research topic of symbolic computation provides efficient algorithmic tools for evaluating and simplifying different types of sums arising from mathematics, computer science, physics and other areas. Most of existing algorithms in symbolic summation are mainly applicable to the problem with univariate inputs. A long-term project in symbolic computation is to develop theories, algorithms and software for the symbolic summation of multivariate functions. This paper will give complete solutions to two challenging problems in symbolic summation of multivariate rational functions, namely the rational summability problem and the existence problem of telescopers for multivariate rational functions. Our approach is based on the structure of Sato's isotropy groups of polynomials, which enables us to reduce the problems to testing the shift equivalence of polynomials. Our results provide a complete solution to the discrete analogue of Picard's problem on differential forms and can be used to detect the applicability of the Wilf-Zeilberger method to multivariate rational functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, to appear in Foundations of Computational Mathematics</p></details> |

If we completely disregard labels, it leads to less symbol information, a larger solution space, and more shortcuts-issues that current Nesy systems cannot resolve. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Verification Learning (VL), which addresses this challenge by transforming the label-based reasoning process in Nesy into a label-free verification process. VL achieves excellent learning results solely by relying on unlabeled data and a function that verifies whether the current predictions conform to the rules. We formalize this problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) and propose a Dynamic combinatorial Sorting (DCS) algorithm that accelerates the solution by reducing verification attempts, effectively lowering computational costs to the level of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). To further enhance performance, we introduce a prior alignment method to address potential shortcuts. Our theoretical analysis points out which tasks in Nesy systems can be completed without labels and explains why rules can replace infinite labels, such as in addition, for some tasks, while for others, like Sudoku, the rules have no effect. We validate the proposed framework through several fully unsupervised tasks including addition, sort, match, and chess, each showing significant performance and efficiency improvements.</p></details> |  |

Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality.

A primary challenge in continual learning is to learn new tasks without losing previously learned knowledge. Current continual learning methods primarily focus on enabling a neural network with mechanisms that mitigate forgetting effects. Inspired by the two distinct systems in the human brain, System 1 and System 2, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Brain-Inspired Continual Learning (NeSyBiCL) framework that incorporates two subsystems to solve continual learning: A neural network model responsible for quickly adapting to the most recent task, together with a symbolic reasoner responsible for retaining previously acquired knowledge from previous tasks. Moreover, we design an integration mechanism between these components to facilitate knowledge transfer from the symbolic reasoner to the neural network. We also introduce two compositional continual learning benchmarks and demonstrate that NeSyBiCL is effective and leads to superior performance compared to continual learning methods that merely rely on neural architectures to address forgetting.</p></details> |  |

As a promising mitigation, the Low-Dimensional Computing (LDC) method significantly reduces the vector dimension by ~100 times while maintaining accuracy, by employing a gradient-based optimization. Despite its potential, LDC optimization for VSA is still underexplored. Our investigation into vector updates underscores the importance of stable, adaptive dynamics in LDC training. We also reveal the overlooked yet critical roles of batch normalization (BN) and knowledge distillation (KD) in standard approaches. Besides the accuracy boost, BN does not add computational overhead during inference, and KD significantly enhances inference confidence. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across multiple benchmarks, we provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and extend the interpretability of binary neural network optimization similar to LDC, previously unaddressed in BNN literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

Existing approaches struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with attributes like coordinates and colors, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large, complex drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique, combining weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale CAD dataset to support our experiments, with each floorplan covering around 1,000 square meters, significantly larger than previous benchmarks. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD datasets show that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also demonstrate its practical value through automating parametric 3D reconstruction, enabling interior modeling directly from raw CAD inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 14 figures, Project web-page: https://dgeneai.github.io/cadspotting-pages/</p></details> |

High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps). Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks. Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects. In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method. Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences. We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects. Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations. This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%. We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results. We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Equations to Insights: Unraveling Symbolic Structures in PDEs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09986v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse fields, the application of AI to solve scientific problems-often formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs)-has garnered increasing attention. While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the finite expression method for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an advanced symbolic regression method that integrates symbol priors from diverse scientific domains - including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering - into the regression process. By systematically analyzing domain-specific expressions, we derive probability distributions of symbols to guide expression generation. We propose novel tree-structured recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverage these symbol priors, enabling domain knowledge to steer the learning process. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical tree structure for representing expressions, where unary and binary operators are organized to facilitate more efficient learning. To further accelerate training, we compile characteristic expression blocks from each domain and include them in the operator dictionary, providing relevant building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging symbol priors significantly enhances the performance of symbolic regression, resulting in faster convergence and higher accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Context Learning and Reasoning for Symbolic Regression with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17448v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based machine learning models that have shown remarkable performance in tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. Here, we explore the potential of LLMs to perform symbolic regression -- a machine-learning method for finding simple and accurate equations from datasets. We prompt GPT-4 to suggest expressions from data, which are then optimized and evaluated using external Python tools. These results are fed back to GPT-4, which proposes improved expressions while optimizing for complexity and loss. Using chain-of-thought prompting, we instruct GPT-4 to analyze the data, prior expressions, and the scientific context (expressed in natural language) for each problem before generating new expressions. We evaluated the workflow in rediscovery of five well-known scientific equations from experimental data, and on an additional dataset without a known equation. GPT-4 successfully rediscovered all five equations, and in general, performed better when prompted to use a scratchpad and consider scientific context. We demonstrate how strategic prompting improves the model's performance and how the natural language interface simplifies integrating theory with data. We also observe how theory can sometimes offset noisy data and, in other cases, data can make up for poor context. Although this approach does not outperform established SR programs where target equations are more complex, LLMs can nonetheless iterate toward improved solutions while following instructions and incorporating scientific context in natural language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

In the absence of a specification for the input language, common test generation techniques rely on sample inputs, which are abstracted into matching grammars and/or evolved guided by test coverage. However, if sample inputs miss features of the input language, the chances of generating these features randomly are slim. In this work, we present the first technique for symbolically and automatically mining input grammars from the code of recursive descent parsers. So far, the complexity of parsers has made such a symbolic analysis challenging to impossible. Our realization of the symbolic parsing technique overcomes these challenges by (1) associating each parser function parse_ELEM() with a nonterminal <ELEM>; (2) limiting recursive calls and loop iterations, such that a symbolic analysis of parse_ELEM() needs to consider only a finite number of paths; and (3) for each path, create an expansion alternative for <ELEM>. Being purely static, symbolic parsing does not require seed inputs; as it mitigates path explosion, it scales to complex parsers. Our evaluation promises symbolic parsing to be highly accurate. Applied on parsers for complex languages such as TINY-C or JSON, our STALAGMITE implementation extracts grammars with an accuracy of 99--100%, widely improving over the state of the art despite requiring only the program code and no input samples. The resulting grammars cover the entire input space, allowing for comprehensive and effective test generation, reverse engineering, and documentation.</p></details> |  |

Effectively learning a family of maps from the parameter function to the system dynamics is of great significance. In this study, we propose a novel learning framework of symbolic continuous-depth neural networks, termed Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (SNODEs), to effectively and accurately learn the underlying dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, our learning framework comprises three stages: initially, pre-training a predefined symbolic neural network via a gradient flow matching strategy; subsequently, fine-tuning this network using Neural ODEs; and finally, constructing a general neural network to capture residuals. In this process, we apply the SNODEs framework to partial differential equation systems through Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling. Moreover, this framework integrates the strengths of symbolism and connectionism, boasting a universal approximation theorem while significantly enhancing interpretability and extrapolation capabilities relative to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We demonstrate this through experiments on several representative complex systems. Therefore, our framework can be further applied to a wide range of scientific problems, such as system bifurcation and control, reconstruction and forecasting, as well as the discovery of new equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2025</p></details> |

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance.

Traditional methods, such as fixed-form parametric models and data-driven approaches, often struggle to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel symbolic regression algorithm based on the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored for dynamic load modeling. The algorithm employs a trainable expression tree with controlled depth and a predefined set of operators to generate compact and interpretable mathematical expressions. The Actor network probabilistically selects operators for the symbolic expression, while the Critic evaluates the resulting expression tree through a loss function. To further enhance performance, a candidate pool mechanism is implemented to store high-performing expressions, which are subsequently fine-tuned using gradient descent. By focusing on simplicity and precision, the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving interpretability. Experimental results validate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, which offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic load modeling and system analysis in modern power systems.</p></details> | 9pages |

A key challenge for embodied agents is the generalization of knowledge across diverse environments and situations, as limited experiences often confine them to their prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, NeSyC, a neuro-symbolic continual learner that emulates the hypothetico-deductive model by continually formulating and validating knowledge from limited experiences through the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic tools. Specifically, we devise a contrastive generality improvement scheme within NeSyC, which iteratively generates hypotheses using LLMs and conducts contrastive validation via symbolic tools. This scheme reinforces the justification for admissible actions while minimizing the inference of inadmissible ones. Additionally, we incorporate a memory-based monitoring scheme that efficiently detects action errors and triggers the knowledge refinement process across domains. Experiments conducted on diverse embodied task benchmarks-including ALFWorld, VirtualHome, Minecraft, RLBench, and a real-world robotic scenario-demonstrate that NeSyC is highly effective in solving complex embodied tasks across a range of open-domain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

However, the aspect of internal language learning, where language serves not only as a communicative tool with others but also as a means for individual thinking, self-reflection, and problem-solving remains underexplored. Developing a language through self-play, without another agent's involvement, poses a unique challenge. It requires an agent to craft symbolic representations and train them using direct gradient methods. The challenge here is that if an agent attempts to learn symbolic representations through self-play using conventional modeling and techniques such as REINFORCE, the solution will offer no advantage over previous multi-agent approaches. We introduce VQEL, a novel method that incorporates Vector Quantization into the agents' architecture, enabling them to autonomously invent and develop discrete symbolic representations in a self-play referential game. Following the self-play phase, agents can enhance their language through reinforcement learning and interactions with other agents in the mutual-play phase. Our experiments across various datasets demonstrate that VQEL not only outperforms the traditional REINFORCE method but also benefits from improved control and reduced susceptibility to collapse, thanks to the incorporation of vector quantization.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by how language abstracts and organizes information to enable better reasoning and generalization, we propose a novel approach for generating symbolic representations from visual data. To learn these sequences, we extend the DINO framework to handle visual and symbolic information. Initial experiments suggest that the generated symbolic sequences capture a meaningful level of abstraction, though further refinement is required. An advantage of our method is its interpretability: the sequences are produced by a decoder transformer using cross-attention, allowing attention maps to be linked to specific symbols and offering insight into how these representations correspond to image regions. This approach lays the foundation for creating interpretable symbolic representations with potential applications in high-level scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAMAS...</summary><p>AAMAS 2025 (with Appendix)</p></details> |

Bridging these metaphors to anatomically driven Western medical (WM) concepts poses significant challenges for both automated language processing and real-world clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-agent and chain-of-thought (CoT) framework designed to interpret TCM metaphors accurately and map them to WM pathophysiology. Specifically, our approach combines domain-specialized agents (TCM Expert, WM Expert) with a Coordinator Agent, leveraging stepwise chain-of-thought prompts to ensure transparent reasoning and conflict resolution. We detail a methodology for building a metaphor-rich TCM dataset, discuss strategies for effectively integrating multi-agent collaboration and CoT reasoning, and articulate the theoretical underpinnings that guide metaphor interpretation across distinct medical paradigms. We present a comprehensive system design and highlight both the potential benefits and limitations of our approach, while leaving placeholders for future experimental validation.

Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

| **[SymbolFit: Automatic Parametric Modeling with Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09851v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SymbolFit, a framework that automates parametric modeling by using symbolic regression to perform a machine-search for functions that fit the data while simultaneously providing uncertainty estimates in a single run. Traditionally, constructing a parametric model to accurately describe binned data has been a manual and iterative process, requiring an adequate functional form to be determined before the fit can be performed. The main challenge arises when the appropriate functional forms cannot be derived from first principles, especially when there is no underlying true closed-form function for the distribution. In this work, we develop a framework that automates and streamlines the process by utilizing symbolic regression, a machine learning technique that explores a vast space of candidate functions without requiring a predefined functional form because the functional form itself is treated as a trainable parameter, making the process far more efficient and effortless than traditional regression methods. We demonstrate the framework in high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using five real proton-proton collision datasets from new physics searches, including background modeling in resonance searches for high-mass dijet, trijet, paired-dijet, diphoton, and dimuon events. We show that our framework can flexibly and efficiently generate a wide range of candidate functions that fit a nontrivial distribution well using a simple fit configuration that varies only by random seed, and that the same fit configuration, which defines a vast function space, can also be applied to distributions of different shapes, whereas achieving a comparable result with traditional methods would have required extensive manual effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 35 figures.

Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

The algorithm exploits dynamical symmetries to construct lean abstractions to avoid redundant computations during synthesis. Our proposed algorithm adds another layer of abstraction over the common grid-based discrete abstraction before solving the synthesis problem. It combines each set of grid cells that are at a similar relative position from the targets and nearby obstacles, defined by the symmetries, into a single abstract state. It uses this layer of abstraction to guide the order by which actions are explored during synthesis over the grid-based abstraction. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by synthesizing a reach-avoid controller for a 3-dimensional ship model with translation and rotation symmetries in the special Euclidean group SE(2).</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has shown promise in brain MRI analysis, it often functions as a black box, limiting interpretability and lacking mechanisms to effectively integrate critical clinical data such as biomarkers, medical history, and demographic information. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuroSymAD, a neuro-symbolic framework that synergizes neural networks with symbolic reasoning. A neural network percepts brain MRI scans, while a large language model (LLM) distills medical rules to guide a symbolic system in reasoning over biomarkers and medical history. This structured integration enhances both diagnostic accuracy and explainability. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that NeuroSymAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.91% in accuracy and 3.43% in F1-score while providing transparent and interpretable diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

We outline an online algorithm for inventing such predicates and learning abstract world models. We compare our approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, vision-language model planning, and symbolic predicate invention approaches, on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks across five simulated robotic domains. Results show that our approach offers better sample complexity, stronger out-of-distribution generalization, and improved interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.</p></details> | Submitted to NeuS'25 |

By combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning we develop a model that outperforms purely numerical methods in accuracy and interpretability. Focusing on sextic polynomials with height $\leq 6$, we analyze a database of 53,972 irreducible examples, uncovering novel distributional trends, such as the 20 sextic polynomials with Galois group $C_6$ spanning just seven invariant-defined equivalence classes. These findings offer the first empirical insights into Galois group probabilities under height constraints and lay the groundwork for exploring solvability by radicals. Demonstrating AI's potential to reveal patterns beyond traditional symbolic techniques, this work paves the way for future research in computational algebra, with implications for probabilistic conjectures and higher degree classifications.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort, RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 1 table. Technical Report</p></details> |

However, they still suffer from overthinking, often performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after reaching the correct answer. This raises the question: can models evaluate the correctness of their intermediate answers during reasoning? In this work, we study whether reasoning models encode information about answer correctness through probing the model's hidden states. The resulting probe can verify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibrated scores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness of future answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before the intermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier to decide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference, reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\% without compromising performance. These findings confirm that reasoning models do encode a notion of correctness yet fail to exploit it, revealing substantial untapped potential to enhance their efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ontology Embedding: A Survey of Methods, Applications and Resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10964v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ontologies are widely used for representing domain knowledge and meta data, playing an increasingly important role in Information Systems, the Semantic Web, Bioinformatics and many other domains. However, logical reasoning that ontologies can directly support are quite limited in learning, approximation and prediction. One straightforward solution is to integrate statistical analysis and machine learning. To this end, automatically learning vector representation for knowledge of an ontology i.e., ontology embedding has been widely investigated. Numerous papers have been published on ontology embedding, but a lack of systematic reviews hinders researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of this field. To bridge this gap, we write this survey paper, which first introduces different kinds of semantics of ontologies and formally defines ontology embedding as well as its property of faithfulness. Based on this, it systematically categorizes and analyses a relatively complete set of over 80 papers, according to the ontologies they aim at and their technical solutions including geometric modeling, sequence modeling and graph propagation. This survey also introduces the applications of ontology embedding in ontology engineering, machine learning augmentation and life sciences, presents a new library mOWL and discusses the challenges and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

However, despite their high performance, concerns remain about the inherent limitations of these models, especially when it comes to learning basic logical functions. While complexity-theoretic analyses indicate that Transformers can represent simple logic functions (e.g., $\mathsf{AND}$, $\mathsf{OR}$, and majority gates) by its nature of belonging to the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class, these results assume ideal parameter settings and do not account for the constraints imposed by gradient descent-based training methods. In this work, we investigate whether Transformers can truly learn simple majority functions when trained using gradient-based methods. We focus on a simplified variant of the Transformer architecture and consider both $n=\mathrm{poly}(d)$ and $n=\exp(\Omega(d))$ number of training samples, where each sample is a $d$-size binary string paired with the output of a basic majority function. Our analysis demonstrates that even after $\mathrm{poly}(d)$ gradient queries, the generalization error of the Transformer model still remains substantially large, growing exponentially with $d$. This work highlights fundamental optimization challenges in training Transformers for the simplest logical reasoning tasks and provides new insights into their theoretical limitations.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks exhibit critical limitations in three dimensions: (1) absence of explanatory annotations, (2) English-centric language bias, and (3) inadequate temporal relevance. To bridge these gaps, we present TrendFact, the first Chinese fact-checking benchmark incorporating structured natural language explanations. TrendFact comprises 7,643 carefully curated samples from trending social media content and professional fact-checking repositories, covering domains such as public health, political discourse, and economic claims. It supports various forms of reasoning, including numerical computation, logical reasoning, and common sense verification. The rigorous multistage construction process ensures high data quality and provides significant challenges. Furthermore, we propose the ECS to complement existing evaluation metrics. To establish effective baselines for TrendFact, we propose FactISR, a dual-component method integrating evidence triangulation and iterative self-reflection mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that current leading reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1) have significant limitations on TrendFact, underscoring the real-world challenges it presents. FactISR significantly enhances reasoning model performance, offering new insights for explainable and complex fact-checking.</p></details> |  |

A Characterization via 3-SAT Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03930v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. In theory, autoregressive LLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can perform more serial computations to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies suggest that, despite this capacity, LLMs do not truly learn to reason but instead fit on statistical features. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. By comparing DeepSeek R1 with other LLMs, our findings reveal two key insights (1) LLM accuracy drops significantly on harder instances, suggesting all current models struggle when statistical shortcuts are unavailable (2) Unlike other LLMs, R1 shows signs of having learned the underlying reasoning. Following a principled experimental protocol, our study moves beyond the benchmark-driven evidence often found in LLM reasoning research. Our findings highlight important gaps and suggest clear directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>An up...</summary><p>An updated version of arXiv:2408.07215v2, featuring: (1) inclusion of recent LRMs and recent LLMs, (2) revised conclusions reflecting recent developments, and (3) updated analysis</p></details> |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00773v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI.

Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these puzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving capabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and analyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including the number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training: SFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT). While both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they exhibit limited generalization to unseen ones.

Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chain of thoughts (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicate that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains.

To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuestBench: Can LLMs ask the right question to acquire information in reasoning tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22674v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a large amount of work has focused on improving large language models' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic. However, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real world, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through acquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this formalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can rigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states that are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math problems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of GSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators. The LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a list of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their accuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient for success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right question to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the problem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even when explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This highlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information acquisition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/google-deepmind/questbench}</p></details> |

Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial challenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored. We construct two multilingual natural language inference (NLI) datasets with \textit{paired} examples differing in negation. We investigate how model size and language impact its ability to handle negation correctly by evaluating popular LLMs. Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size consistently improves the models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the models' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent and that the length and explicitness of the premise have a greater impact on robustness than language. Our datasets can facilitate further research and improvements of language model reasoning in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |

While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation.

| **[ShieldAgent: Shielding Agents via Verifiable Safety Policy Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22738v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption across various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.</p></details> |  |

Within machine learning, the ultimate aspiration is to attain Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a machine. This pursuit has led to the exploration of two distinct AI paradigms. Symbolic AI, also known as classical or GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) and Connectionist (Sub-symbolic) AI, represented by Neural Systems, are two mutually exclusive paradigms. Symbolic AI excels in reasoning, explainability, and knowledge representation but faces challenges in processing complex real-world data with noise. Conversely, deep learning (Black-Box systems) research breakthroughs in neural networks are notable, yet they lack reasoning and interpretability. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), an emerging area of AI research, attempts to bridge this gap by integrating logical reasoning into neural networks, enabling them to learn and reason with symbolic representations. While a long path, this strategy has made significant progress towards achieving common sense reasoning by systems. This article conducts an extensive review of over 977 studies from prominent scientific databases (DBLP, ACL, IEEExplore, Scopus, PubMed, ICML, ICLR), thoroughly examining the multifaceted capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular focus on its healthcare applications, particularly in drug discovery, and Protein engineering research. The survey addresses vital themes, including reasoning, explainability, integration strategies, 41 healthcare-related use cases, benchmarking, datasets, current approach limitations from both healthcare and broader perspectives, and proposed novel approaches for future experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Unlike conventional methods that naively set banned tokens' logits to $-\infty$, which can distort the conversion from raw logits to posterior probabilities and increase output variance, (G)I-DLE re-normalizes the allowed token probabilities to minimize such distortion. We validate our method on the K2-Eval dataset, specifically designed to assess Korean language fluency, logical reasoning, and cultural appropriateness. Experimental results on Qwen2.5 models (ranging from 1.5B to 14B) demonstrate that G-IDLE not only boosts mean evaluation scores but also substantially reduces the variance of output quality.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Enhancing Retrieval Systems with Inference-Time Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17860v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional retrieval methods rely on transforming user queries into vector representations and retrieving documents based on cosine similarity within an embedding space. While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly improving retrieval performance for complex queries.</p></details> |  |

While recent advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in logical reasoning and multi-task generalization, their applications in Re-ID tasks remain limited. They either struggle to perform accurate matching based on identity-relevant features or assist image-dominated branches as auxiliary semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ChatReID, that shifts the focus towards a text-side-dominated retrieval paradigm, enabling flexible and interactive re-identification. To integrate the reasoning abilities of language models into Re-ID pipelines, We first present a large-scale instruction dataset, which contains more than 8 million prompts to promote the model fine-tuning. Next. we introduce a hierarchical progressive tuning strategy, which endows Re-ID ability through three stages of tuning, i.e., from person attribute understanding to fine-grained image retrieval and to multi-modal task reasoning. Extensive experiments across ten popular benchmarks demonstrate that ChatReID outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all Re-ID tasks. More experiments demonstrate that ChatReID not only has the ability to recognize fine-grained details but also to integrate them into a coherent reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences. This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading. Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.</p></details> | 52 pages, 19 figures |
| **[From Chaos to Order: The Atomic Reasoner Framework for Fine-grained Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15944v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, yet their capacity for logical ``slow-thinking'' reasoning persists as a critical research frontier. Current inference scaling paradigms suffer from two fundamental constraints: fragmented thought flows compromising logical coherence, and intensively computational complexity that escalates with search space dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we present \textbf{Atomic Reasoner} (\textbf{AR}), a cognitive inference strategy that enables fine-grained reasoning through systematic atomic-level operations. AR decomposes the reasoning process into atomic cognitive units, employing a cognitive routing mechanism to dynamically construct reasoning representations and orchestrate inference pathways. This systematic methodology implements stepwise, structured cognition, which ensures logical coherence while significantly reducing cognitive load, effectively simulating the cognitive patterns observed in human deep thinking processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AR's superior reasoning capabilities without the computational burden of exhaustive solution searches, particularly excelling in linguistic logic puzzles. These findings substantiate AR's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' capacity for robust, long-sequence logical reasoning and deliberation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration for Reliable LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07627v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness. The code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/Auto-CEI .</p></details> | 20 pages |

However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Like Human Developers: Harnessing Community Knowledge for Structured Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14838v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced automated code generation, yet they struggle with complex coding tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning. High-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities, but such datasets remain scarce. Existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive reinforcement learning (RL) or error-prone reasoning chains synthesized by LLMs, posing challenges in scalability and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose SVRC (Structured and Validated Reasoning Chains for Code Generation), a novel framework that mines, restructures, and enriches reasoning chains from community-driven discussions on software engineering platforms. SVRC refines unstructured and incomplete discussions of coding problems by aligning them with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles, ensuring that reasoning chains capture real-world problem-solving strategies and support iterative refinement. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVRC, we introduce CodeThinker, an LLM fine-tuned on 12,444 reasoning-augmented samples generated by SVRC. Experiments on LiveCodeBench show that CodeThinker surpasses its base model by 42.86\% on medium-level code problems in terms of pass@1 and outperforms GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o by 73.14\% and 115.86\%, respectively. Our ablation study further highlights that each component of SVRC contributes to the reasoning capabilities of CodeThinker.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15551v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> |  |

AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DAxisPrompt: Promoting the 3D Grounding and Reasoning in GPT-4o](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13185v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, especially when equipped with carefully designed visual prompts. However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the 3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically, our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world 3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various 3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt engineering techniques.</p></details> |  |

The ideas that he raised in his study of logical reasoning carried the development of science over the centuries. Today, in the era of AI, this title of the fatherhood of logic has a renewed significance. Behind it lies his original idea that human reasoning could be studied as a process and that perhaps there exist universal systems of reasoning that underly all human reasoning irrespective of the content of what we are reasoning about. In this article, we look into Aristotle's work on human thought, his work on reasoning itself but also on how it relates to science and human endeavor more generally, from a modern perspective of Artificial Intelligence and ask if this can help enlighten our understanding of AI and Science more generally.</p></details> | 40 pages |

We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (excl. appendix)</p></details> |

These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn</p></details> |  |

A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper are available at https://long-cot.github.io/</p></details> |

The quality of the provided demonstrations significantly influences the success of downstream inference tasks. Current unsupervised CoT methods primarily select examples based on the semantics of the questions, which can introduce noise and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose leveraging reasoning patterns to enhance CoT prompting effectiveness. Reasoning patterns represent the process by which language models arrive at their final results. By utilizing prior knowledge and prompt-based methods from large models, we first construct task-specific pattern sets. We then select diverse demonstrations based on different reasoning patterns. This approach not only mitigates the impact of noise but also provides explicit interpretability to help us understand the mechanisms of CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is more robust and consistently leads to improvements across various reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We identify three hierarchical tiers and two corresponding transitions and show their correspondence to specific abilities in transformer-based language models (LMs). These emergent abilities have often been described in terms of scaling; we show that it is the transition between tiers, rather than scaled size itself, that determines a system's capabilities. Specifically, humans effortlessly process language yet require critical training to perform arithmetic or logical reasoning tasks; and LMs possess language abilities absent from predecessor systems, yet still struggle with logical processing. We submit a novel benchmark of computational power, provide empirical evaluations of humans and fifteen LMs, and, most significantly, provide a theoretically grounded framework to promote careful thinking about these crucial topics. The resulting principled analyses provide explanatory accounts of the abilities and shortfalls of LMs, and suggest actionable insights into the expansion of their logic abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the image's structure and details, impacting the generation's accuracy and stability. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Prompt engineering, as a key technique for guiding LLMs, leverages specifically designed prompts to improve model performance on complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation while maintaining contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by prompt engineering from the field of NLP, we propose Vision Full-view prompt (VF prompt) to enhance autoregressive image generation. Specifically, we design specialized image-related VF prompts for AR image generation to simulate the process of human image creation. This enhances contextual logic ability by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without VF prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p></details> |  |

The reliance on retrieval alone proves insufficient for extracting deep, domain-specific knowledge performing in logical reasoning from specialized corpora. To address this, we introduce sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmentation Generation (PIKE-RAG), focusing on extracting, understanding, and applying specialized knowledge, while constructing coherent rationale to incrementally steer LLMs toward accurate responses. Recognizing the diverse challenges of industrial tasks, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies tasks based on their complexity in knowledge extraction and application, allowing for a systematic evaluation of RAG systems' problem-solving capabilities. This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications. Furthermore, we propose knowledge atomizing and knowledge-aware task decomposition to effectively extract multifaceted knowledge from the data chunks and iteratively construct the rationale based on original query and the accumulated knowledge, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, technique report</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding.

However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> |  |

While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LMM-R1}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that LMM-R1 achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</p></details> |  |

However, training and serving these models require substantial computational resources, posing a significant barrier to their widespread application and further research. To mitigate this challenge, various model compression techniques have been developed to reduce computational requirements. Nevertheless, existing methods often employ uniform quantization configurations, failing to account for the varying difficulties across different layers in quantizing large neural network models. This paper tackles this issue by leveraging layer-sensitivity features, such as activation sensitivity and weight distribution Kurtosis, to identify layers that are challenging to quantize accurately and allocate additional memory budget. The proposed methods, named SensiBoost and KurtBoost, respectively, demonstrate notable improvement in quantization accuracy, achieving up to 9% lower perplexity with only a 2% increase in memory budget on LLama models compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-Training Meta-Rule Selection Policy for Visual Generative Abductive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06427v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generative abductive learning studies jointly training symbol-grounded neural visual generator and inducing logic rules from data, such that after learning, the visual generation process is guided by the induced logic rules. A major challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction during learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the logic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently proposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming at significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search space. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of both symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively integrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training process is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of raw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional interesting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol grounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the memorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of symbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to effectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction, boosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning.

| **[To Rely or Not to Rely? Evaluating Interventions for Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15584v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust. Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with 400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making wrong reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance interventions in human-LLM collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowLogic: A Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning via Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06218v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluations of commonsense reasoning in LLMs are hindered by the scarcity of natural language corpora with structured annotations for reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce KnowLogic, a benchmark generated through a knowledge-driven synthetic data strategy. KnowLogic integrates diverse commonsense knowledge, plausible scenarios, and various types of logical reasoning. One of the key advantages of KnowLogic is its adjustable difficulty levels, allowing for flexible control over question complexity. It also includes fine-grained labels for in-depth evaluation of LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple dimensions. Our benchmark consists of 3,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) questions across various domains, and presents significant challenges for current LLMs, with the highest-performing model achieving only 69.57\%. Our analysis highlights common errors, such as misunderstandings of low-frequency commonsense, logical inconsistencies, and overthinking. This approach, along with our benchmark, provides a valuable tool for assessing and enhancing LLMs' commonsense reasoning capabilities and can be applied to a wide range of knowledge domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow of Reasoning:Training LLMs for Divergent Problem Solving with Minimal Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05673v5)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

| **[NAVER: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Automaton for Visual Grounding with Explicit Logic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00372v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Grounding (VG) tasks, such as referring expression detection and segmentation tasks are important for linking visual entities to context, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require detailed query interpretation. This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, these systems often struggle with complex database structures and domain-specific queries, as they primarily focus on enhancing logical reasoning and SQL syntax while overlooking the critical need for comprehensive database understanding. To address this limitation, we propose DB-Explore, a novel framework that systematically aligns LLMs with database knowledge through automated exploration and instruction synthesis. DB-Explore constructs database graphs to capture complex relational schemas, leverages GPT-4 to systematically mine structural patterns and semantic knowledge, and synthesizes instructions to distill this knowledge for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. Our framework enables comprehensive database understanding through diverse sampling strategies and automated instruction generation, bridging the gap between database structures and language models. Experiments conducted on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks validate the effectiveness of DB-Explore, achieving an execution accuracy of 52.1% on BIRD and 84.0% on SPIDER. Notably, our open-source implementation, based on the Qwen2.5-coder-7B model, outperforms multiple GPT-4-driven text-to-SQL systems in comparative evaluations, and achieves near state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dedicated Feedback and Edit Models Empower Inference-Time Scaling for Open-Ended General-Domain Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04378v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[LGR2: Language Guided Reward Relabeling for Accelerating Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05881v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interactive systems that utilize natural language instructions to solve complex robotic control tasks has long been a goal of the robotics community. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation, translating high-level instructions into low-level robotic actions still remains challenging. Furthermore, solving such tasks often requires acquiring policies to execute diverse subtasks and integrating them to achieve the final objective. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) offers a promising solution for solving such tasks by enabling temporal abstraction and improved exploration. However, HRL suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing lower-level behaviour, which hinders effective policy learning. We propose LGR2, a novel HRL framework that mitigates non-stationarity in HRL by using language-guided higher-level rewards that remain unaffected by the changing lower-level policy behaviour. To analyze the efficacy of our approach, we perform empirical analysis to demonstrate that LGR2 effectively mitigates non-stationarity in HRL and attains success rates exceeding 70% in challenging, sparsely-rewarded robotic navigation and manipulation environments, where other baselines typically fail to show significant progress. Finally, we perform real-world robotic experiments on complex tasks and demonstrate that LGR2 consistently outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of counseling datasets, particularly in Chinese corpora, restricts their application in this field. To address this, we constructed Psy-Insight, the first mental health-oriented explainable multi-task bilingual dataset. We collected face-to-face multi-turn counseling dialogues, which are annotated with multi-task labels and conversation process explanations. Our annotations include psychotherapy, emotion, strategy, and topic labels, as well as turn-level reasoning and session-level guidance. Psy-Insight is not only suitable for tasks such as label recognition but also meets the need for training LLMs to act as empathetic counselors through logical reasoning. Experiments show that training LLMs on Psy-Insight enables the models to not only mimic the conversation style but also understand the underlying strategies and reasoning of counseling.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoT: Highlighted Chain of Thought for Referencing Supporting Facts from Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02003v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |
| **[On Memorization of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles. Our code and data are available at https://memkklogic.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although existing CLQA algorithms achieve high accuracy in answering such queries, their reasoning time and memory usage scale significantly with the number of First-Order Logic (FOL) operators involved, creating serious challenges for practical deployment. In addition, current research primarily focuses on algorithm-level optimizations for CLQA tasks, often overlooking compiler-level optimizations, which can offer greater generality and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a Knowledge Graph Compiler, namely KGCompiler, the first deep learning compiler specifically designed for CLQA tasks. By incorporating KG-specific optimizations proposed in this paper, KGCompiler enhances the reasoning performance of CLQA algorithms without requiring additional manual modifications to their implementations. At the same time, it significantly reduces memory usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KGCompiler accelerates CLQA algorithms by factors ranging from 1.04x to 8.26x, with an average speedup of 3.71x. We also provide an interface to enable hands-on experience with KGCompiler.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have examined the impact of factors such as data volume and model size on English models, the scaling properties of instruction tuning in other languages remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of data quantity, model size, and data construction methods on instruction tuning for Chinese LLMs. We utilize a newly curated dataset, DoIT, which includes over 40,000 high-quality instruction instances covering ten underlying abilities, such as creative writing, code generation, and logical reasoning. Our experiments, conducted on models ranging from 7b to 33b parameters, yield three key findings: (i) While these factors directly affect overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, whereas others demonstrate significant resistance. (ii) The scaling sensitivity of different abilities to these factors can be explained by two features: Complexity and Transference. (iii) By tailoring training strategies to their varying sensitivities, specific abilities can be efficiently learned, enhancing performance on two public benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING 2025</p></details> |

However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework.

Most previous works have focused on learning entity/relation embeddings and simulating first-order logic operators with various neural networks. However, they are bottlenecked by the inability to share world knowledge to improve logical reasoning, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a complex reasoning schema over KG upon large language models (LLMs), containing a curriculum-based logical-aware instruction tuning framework, named LACT. Specifically, we augment the arbitrary first-order logical queries via binary tree decomposition, to stimulate the reasoning capability of LLMs. To address the difficulty gap among different types of complex queries, we design a simple and flexible logic-aware curriculum learning framework. Experiments across widely used datasets demonstrate that LACT has substantial improvements~(brings an average +5.5% MRR score) over advanced methods, achieving the new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

By first-order, we mean these problems can be instantiated with potentially an infinite number of problem instances of varying sizes. They are also challenging being NP-hard and requiring several reasoning steps to reach a solution. While existing work has focused on coming up with datasets with hard benchmarks, there is limited work which exploits the first-order nature of the problem structure. To address this challenge, we present FCoReBench, a dataset of 40 such challenging problems, along with scripts to generate problem instances of varying sizes and automatically verify and generate their solutions. We first observe that LLMs, even when aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset, being unable to leverage the underlying structure of these problems. We specifically observe a drop in performance with increasing problem size. In response, we propose a new approach, SymPro-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers and program interpreters, along with feedback from a few solved examples, to achieve huge performance gains. Our proposed approach is robust to changes in the problem size, and has the unique characteristic of not requiring any LLM call during inference time, unlike earlier approaches. As an additional experiment, we also demonstrate SymPro-LM's effectiveness on other logical reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses - a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitate an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are threefold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, especially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts. We have made our source code and benchmarks available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, LLMs struggle with reasoning order variations and fail to generalize across logically equivalent transformations. LLMs often rely on fixed sequential patterns rather than true logical understanding. To address this issue, we introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on commutativity in logical reasoning. We first randomly shuffle independent premises to introduce condition order augmentation. For reasoning steps, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between steps, which allows us to identify valid reorderings of steps while preserving logical correctness. By leveraging order-centric augmentations, models can develop a more flexible and generalized reasoning process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning performance and adaptability to diverse logical structures. We release our codes and augmented data in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Order-Centric-Data-Augmentation-822C/.</p></details> |  |

Numerous studies are dedicated to exploring and expanding the boundaries of this reasoning capability. However, tasks that embody both reasoning and recall characteristics are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce such a novel task, code reasoning, to provide a new perspective for the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We summarize three meta-benchmarks based on established forms of logical reasoning, and instantiate these into eight specific benchmark tasks. Our testing on these benchmarks reveals that LLMs continue to struggle with identifying satisfactory reasoning pathways. Additionally, we present a new pathway exploration pipeline inspired by human intricate problem-solving methods. This Reflective Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment (RHDA) pipeline consists of the following iterative steps: (1) Proposing potential hypotheses based on observations and decomposing them; (2) Utilizing tools to validate hypotheses and reflection outcomes; (3) Revising hypothesis in light of observations. Our approach effectively mitigates logical chain collapses arising from forgetting or hallucination issues in multi-step reasoning, resulting in performance gains of up to $3\times$. Finally, we expanded this pipeline by applying it to simulate complex household tasks in real-world scenarios, specifically in VirtualHome, enhancing the handling of failure cases.

In this paper, we introduce TextGames, an innovative benchmark specifically crafted to assess LLMs through demanding text-based games that require advanced skills in pattern recognition, spatial awareness, arithmetic, and logical reasoning. Our analysis probes LLMs' performance in both single-turn and multi-turn reasoning, and their abilities in leveraging feedback to correct subsequent answers through self-reflection. Our findings reveal that, although LLMs exhibit proficiency in addressing most easy and medium-level problems, they face significant challenges with more difficult tasks. In contrast, humans are capable of solving all tasks when given sufficient time. Moreover, we observe that LLMs show improved performance in multi-turn predictions through self-reflection, yet they still struggle with sequencing, counting, and following complex rules consistently. Additionally, models optimized for reasoning outperform pre-trained LLMs that prioritize instruction following, highlighting the crucial role of reasoning skills in addressing highly complex problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From System 1 to System 2: A Survey of Reasoning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17419v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Slow-...</summary><p>Slow-thinking, Large Language Models, Human-like Reasoning, Decision Making in AI, AGI</p></details> |
| **[Sphere Neural-Networks for Rational Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like communication, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training data, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic unification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide and Translate: Compositional First-Order Logic Translation and Verification for Complex Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08047v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex logical reasoning tasks require a long sequence of reasoning, which a large language model (LLM) with chain-of-thought prompting still falls short. To alleviate this issue, neurosymbolic approaches incorporate a symbolic solver. Specifically, an LLM only translates a natural language problem into a satisfiability (SAT) problem that consists of first-order logic formulas, and a sound symbolic solver returns a mathematically correct solution. However, we discover that LLMs have difficulties to capture complex logical semantics hidden in the natural language during translation. To resolve this limitation, we propose a Compositional First-Order Logic Translation. An LLM first parses a natural language sentence into newly defined logical dependency structures that consist of an atomic subsentence and its dependents, then sequentially translate the parsed subsentences. Since multiple logical dependency structures and sequential translations are possible for a single sentence, we also introduce two Verification algorithms to ensure more reliable results. We utilize an SAT solver to rigorously compare semantics of generated first-order logic formulas and select the most probable one. We evaluate the proposed method, dubbed CLOVER, on seven logical reasoning benchmarks and show that it outperforms the previous neurosymbolic approaches and achieves new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[GraphIC: A Graph-Based In-Context Example Retrieval Model for Multi-Step Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02203v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating demonstration examples, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on the quality of selected examples. Current methods typically use text embeddings to measure semantic similarity, which often introduces bias in multi-step reasoning tasks. This occurs because text embeddings contain irrelevant semantic information and lack deeper reasoning structures. To address this, we propose GraphIC, a graph-based retrieval model that leverages reasoning-aware representation and specialized similarity metric for in-context example retrieval. GraphIC first constructs thought graphs-directed, node-attributed graphs that explicitly model reasoning steps and their dependencies-for candidate examples and queries. This approach filters out superficial semantics while preserving essential reasoning processes. Next, GraphIC retrieves examples using a novel similarity metric tailored for these graphs, capturing sequential reasoning patterns and asymmetry between examples. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms 10 baseline methods. Our results highlight the importance of reasoning-aware retrieval in ICL, offering a robust solution for enhancing LLM performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning, empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the multidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and provides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various natural language tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making LLMs Reason? The Intermediate Language Problem in Neurosymbolic Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17216v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning tasks manifest themselves as a challenge to Large Language Models (LLMs). Neurosymbolic approaches use LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems formulated in natural language into a formal intermediate language. Subsequently, the usage of symbolic reasoners yields reliable solving thereof. However, LLMs often fail in translation due to poorly chosen intermediate languages. We introduce the intermediate language problem, which is the problem of choosing a suitable formal language representation for neurosymbolic approaches. Theoretically, we argue that its origins lie in the inability of LLMs to distinguish syntax from semantics and the relative independence of the problem from its representation. We showcase its existence experimentally by contrasting two intermediate languages, Answer Set Programming and the Python Knowledge Engine. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of varying degrees of supplementary context information. Our results show a maximum difference in overall-accuracy of 53.20% and 49.26% in execution-accuracy. When using the GPT4o-mini LLM we beat the state-of-the-art in overall-accuracy on the ProntoQA dataset by 21.20% and by 50.50% on the ProofWriter dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Haystacks: Probing LLMs Long-Context Logical Reasoning (Without Easily Identifiable Unrelated Padding)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17169v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate promising long context processing capabilities, with recent models touting context windows close to one million tokens. However, the evaluations supporting these claims often involve simple retrieval tasks or synthetic tasks padded with irrelevant text, which the models may easily detect and discard. In this work, we generate lengthy simplified English text with first-order logic representations spanning up to 2048 clauses (around 25k GPT-4 tokens). We formulate an evaluation task with evidence retrieval for contradiction detection. The long, homogeneous text is filled with distractors that are both hard to distinguish from relevant evidences and provably not interfering with them. Our evaluation of evidence retrieval shows that the effective context window is much smaller with realistic distractors, already crumbling at 128 clauses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Logical Consistency in Transformers via Query-Key Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17017v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to perform multi-step logical reasoning remains an open challenge. Although Chain-of-Thought prompting has improved logical reasoning by enabling models to generate intermediate steps, it lacks mechanisms to assess the coherence of these logical transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight evaluation strategy for logical reasoning that uses query-key alignments inside transformer attention heads. By computing a single forward pass and extracting a "QK-score" from carefully chosen heads, our method reveals latent representations that reliably separate valid from invalid inferences, offering a scalable alternative to traditional ablation-based techniques. We also provide an empirical validation on multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness of our evaluation method against distractors and increased reasoning depth. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of models, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Integration Brings Causal and Reliable Reasoning Proofs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09802v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two lines of approaches are adopted for complex reasoning with LLMs. One line of work prompts LLMs with various reasoning structures, while the structural outputs can be naturally regarded as intermediate reasoning steps. Another line of work adopt LLM-free declarative solvers to do the reasoning task, rendering higher reasoning accuracy but lacking interpretability due to the black-box nature of the solvers. Aiming to resolve the trade-off between answer accuracy and interpretability, we present a simple extension to the latter line of work. Specifically, we showcase that the intermediate search logs generated by Prolog interpreters can be accessed and interpreted into human-readable reasoning proofs. As long as LLMs correctly translate problem descriptions into Prolog representations, the corresponding reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable. On two logical reasoning and one arithmetic reasoning datasets, our framework obtains significant improvements in terms of both answer accuracy and reasoning proof accuracy.

To obtain more accurate assessments of models' reasoning capabilities, we propose an automated method for synthesizing open-ended logic puzzles, and use it to develop a bilingual benchmark, AutoLogi. Our approach features program-based verification and controllable difficulty levels, enabling more reliable evaluation that better distinguishes models' reasoning abilities. Extensive evaluation of eight modern LLMs shows that AutoLogi can better reflect true model capabilities, with performance scores spanning from 35% to 73% compared to the narrower range of 21% to 37% on the source multiple-choice dataset. Beyond benchmark creation, this synthesis method can generate high-quality training data by incorporating program verifiers into the rejection sampling process, enabling systematic enhancement of LLMs' reasoning capabilities across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.02439</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Scoring Processes: Dissecting the Differences between LLMs and Human Graders in Automatic Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18328v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results underscore the need for a nuanced approach when applying LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Technology, Knowledge, and Learning (TKNL)</p></details> |

Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04937v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |

The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triangulating LLM Progress through Benchmarks, Games, and Cognitive Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14359v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine three evaluation paradigms: large question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We use this method to automatically create several datasets consisting of questions asking for the truth or falsity of first-order logic statements in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. While the resolution of these questions does not require any knowledge beyond basic notation of first-order logic and set theory, it does require a degree of planning and logical reasoning, which can be controlled up to arbitrarily high difficulty by the complexity of the generated statements. Furthermore, we do extensive evaluations of the performance of various large language models, including recent models such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini, on these datasets.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware DistIllation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods face several limitations: inference-phase techniques (e.g., Chain of Thoughts) rely on prompt selection and the pretrained knowledge; sentence-level Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with step-wise mathematical correctness and depend on stronger models distillation or human annotations; while Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches incur high GPU memory costs and unstable training. To address these, we propose \textbf{S}elf-training framework integrating \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{P}reference learning using \textbf{D}ynamic value margin (SPPD). SPPD leverages a process-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman optimality equation to derive \textbf{dynamic value margin} on step-level preference optimization, which employs tree-based self-sampling on model responses \textbf{without any distillation} from other models. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that SPPD is \textbf{equivalent to on-policy policy gradient methods} under reward constraints. Experiments on 7B-scale models demonstrate superior performance across in-domain and out-domain mathematical benchmarks. We open-source our code at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SSDPO-D-DCDD}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SPPD-DCDD}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15806v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

A particularly damaging type is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where generated content contradicts established facts. Addressing FCH presents three main challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and maintaining large-scale benchmark datasets is difficult and resource-intensive; 2) Generating complex and efficient test cases that the LLM has not been trained on -- especially those involving intricate temporal features -- is challenging, yet crucial for eliciting hallucinations; and 3) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, particularly with complex logical relationships, as it requires transparency in the model's decision-making process. This paper presents Drowzee, an innovative end-to-end metamorphic testing framework that utilizes temporal logic to identify fact-conflicting hallucinations (FCH) in large language models (LLMs). Drowzee builds a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia and uses automated temporal-logic reasoning to convert this knowledge into a large, extensible set of test cases with ground truth answers. LLMs are tested using these cases through template-based prompts, which require them to generate both answers and reasoning steps. To validate the reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that compare the semantic structure of LLM outputs to the ground truths. Across nine LLMs in nine different knowledge domains, experimental results show that Drowzee effectively identifies rates of non-temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%, and rates of temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 16.7% to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, under review. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.00648</p></details> |
| **[Deliberate Reasoning in Language Models as Structure-Aware Planning with an Accurate World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03136v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Smooth Transition Between Induction and Deduction: Fast Abductive Learning Based on Probabilistic Symbol Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12919v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive learning (ABL) that integrates strengths of machine learning and logical reasoning to improve the learning generalization, has been recently shown effective. However, its efficiency is affected by the transition between numerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computational costs in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited. In this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithms for ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbol relationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes, resulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address these challenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as Probabilistic Symbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction and deduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged. We leverage probability as a bridge and present an efficient data structure, achieving the transfer from a continuous probability sequence to discrete Boolean sequences with low computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate the promising results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Computations for LLM Reasoning and Planning: A Benchmark and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12521v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. Recent advances in inference-time techniques demonstrate the potential to enhance LLM reasoning without additional training by exploring intermediate steps during inference. Notably, OpenAI's o1 model shows promising performance through its novel use of multi-step reasoning and verification. Here, we explore how scaling inference-time techniques can improve reasoning and planning, focusing on understanding the tradeoff between computational cost and performance. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, known as Sys2Bench, and perform extensive experiments evaluating existing inference-time techniques on eleven diverse tasks across five categories, including arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, common sense reasoning, algorithmic reasoning, and planning. Our findings indicate that simply scaling inference-time computation has limitations, as no single inference-time technique consistently performs well across all reasoning and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HopRAG: Multi-Hop Reasoning for Logic-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12442v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with imperfect retrieval, as traditional retrievers focus on lexical or semantic similarity rather than logical relevance. To address this, we propose HopRAG, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, HopRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections established via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a retrieve-reason-prune mechanism: starting with lexically or semantically similar passages, the system explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to identify truly relevant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate HopRAG's superiority, achieving 76.78\% higher answer accuracy and 65.07\% improved retrieval F1 score compared to conventional methods. The repository is available at https://github.com/LIU-Hao-2002/HopRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Might Not Care What You Are Saying: Prompt Format Beats Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08780v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the help of in-context learning (ICL), large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various tasks. However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code will be publicly available once this paper is published.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warmup Generations: A Task-Agnostic Approach for Guiding Sequence-to-Sequence Learning with Unsupervised Initial State Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12304v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategies for sequence-to-sequence tasks often train models to directly generate the target output. Recent work has shown that guiding models with intermediate steps, such as keywords, outlines, or reasoning chains, can significantly improve performance, coherence, and interpretability. However, these methods often depend on predefined intermediate formats and annotated data, limiting their scalability and generalizability. In this work, we introduce a task-agnostic framework that enables models to generate intermediate "warmup" sequences. These warmup sequences, serving as an initial state for subsequent generation, are optimized to enhance the probability of generating the target sequence without relying on external supervision or human-designed structures. Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles, our method iteratively refines these intermediate steps to maximize their contribution to the final output, similar to reward-driven optimization in reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experimental results across tasks such as translation, summarization, and multi-choice question answering for logical reasoning show that our approach outperforms traditional SFT methods, and offers a scalable and flexible solution for sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Expert Knowledge into Logical Programs via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12275v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical forms complement probability in understanding language model (and human) performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09589v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing interest in using large language models (LLMs) for planning in natural language, understanding their behaviors becomes an important research question. This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical forms should be considered as important factors. In addition, we show similarities and discrepancies between the logical reasoning performances of humans and LLMs by collecting and comparing behavioral data from both.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[PhysReason: A Comprehensive Benchmark towards Physics-Based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12054v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various domains, especially mathematics and logic reasoning. However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models. Our code and data will be published at https:/dxzxy12138.github.io/PhysReason.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mechanistic Interpretation of Syllogistic Reasoning in Auto-Regressive Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08590v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on logical reasoning in Language Models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether they can learn systematic reasoning principles during pre-training or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. This paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic reasoning in LMs to advance the understanding of internal dynamics. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at interpreting content-independent reasoning mechanisms. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic reasoning, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes, model sizes and architectures, finding that the identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for the schemes on which the models achieve high downstream accuracy (> 60%), and that the activation patterns apply to models of different families. Overall, our findings suggest that LMs indeed learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalizable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.</p></details> |  |

First, we synthesize complex reasoning problems through source algorithm problems and test cases. Then, standard answers and intermediate variable outputs are obtained for each problem based on standard python solutions and test cases. Finally, with the guidance of code intermediate variables, we synthesize the text reasoning process for each reasoning problems. Through this method, we can synthesize data that is difficult, scalable, effective, and comes with golden standard answers and high-quality reasoning processes. As a result, with our 540K synthesized dataset constructed solely from 2,360 algorithm problems, our approach Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/jiangjin1999/LogicPro achieves significant improvements in multiple models for the datasets \textit{BBH$^{27}$}, \textit{LogicBench}, \textit{DROP}, \textit{AR-LSAT}, and \textit{GSM8K}, etc. outperforming a wide range of existing reasoning datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dialogue-based Explanations for Logical Reasoning using Structured Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11291v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in knowledge bases (KBs) is a prominent topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI). While there is some work on this problem, the explanations provided by existing approaches often lack critical information or fail to be expressive enough for non-binary conflicts. In this paper, we identify structural weaknesses of the state-of-the-art and propose a generic argumentation-based approach to address these problems. This approach is defined for logics involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets and shows how any such logic can be translated to argumentation. Our work provides dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures to compute and explain a query answer wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics. This allows us to construct dialectical proof trees as explanations, which are more expressive and arguably more intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 gigures, journal</p></details> |
