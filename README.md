| **[SeqFusion: Sequential Fusion of Pre-Trained Models for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02836v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike traditional time-series forecasting methods that require extensive in-task data for training, zero-shot forecasting can directly predict future values given a target time series without additional training data. Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7 to 89.1 on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[Generating Quantum Reservoir State Representations with Random Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computation measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices could be used for real-world computational applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means of generating state representations. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail, along with an exploration of the diversity of measurements provided by the random matrices. In addition, we explore the role of reservoir parameters such as coupling strength and measurement dimension, providing insight into how these learning machines could be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices, and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Performance of Zero-Shot Time Series Foundation Models on Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12944v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |

However, there is limited understanding of how public audiences engage with these maps and extract essential information. Our study investigates the sensemaking of young, digitally native viewers as they interact with crisis maps. We integrate frameworks from the learning sciences and human-data interaction to explore sensemaking through two empirical studies: a thematic analysis of online comments from a New York Times series on graph comprehension, and interviews with 18 participants from German-speaking regions. Our analysis categorizes sensemaking activities into established clusters: inspecting, engaging with content, and placing, and introduces responding personally to capture the affective dimension. We identify friction points connected to these clusters, including struggles with color concepts, responses to missing context, lack of personal connection, and distrust, offering insights for improving crisis communication to public audiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[FNETS: Factor-adjusted network estimation and forecasting for high-dimensional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06110v6)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FNETS, a methodology for network estimation and forecasting of high-dimensional time series exhibiting strong serial- and cross-sectional correlations. We operate under a factor-adjusted vector autoregressive (VAR) model which, after accounting for pervasive co-movements of the variables by {\it common} factors, models the remaining {\it idiosyncratic} dynamic dependence between the variables as a sparse VAR process. Network estimation of FNETS consists of three steps: (i) factor-adjustment via dynamic principal component analysis, (ii) estimation of the latent VAR process via $\ell_1$-regularised Yule-Walker estimator, and (iii) estimation of partial correlation and long-run partial correlation matrices. In doing so, we learn three networks underpinning the VAR process, namely a directed network representing the Granger causal linkages between the variables, an undirected one embedding their contemporaneous relationships and finally, an undirected network that summarises both lead-lag and contemporaneous linkages. In addition, FNETS provides a suite of methods for forecasting the factor-driven and the idiosyncratic VAR processes. Under general conditions permitting tails heavier than the Gaussian one, we derive uniform consistency rates for the estimators in both network estimation and forecasting, which hold as the dimension of the panel and the sample size diverge. Simulation studies and real data application confirm the good performance of FNETS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZAPBench: A Benchmark for Whole-Brain Activity Prediction in Zebrafish](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02618v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven benchmarks have led to significant progress in key scientific modeling domains including weather and structural biology. Here, we introduce the Zebrafish Activity Prediction Benchmark (ZAPBench) to measure progress on the problem of predicting cellular-resolution neural activity throughout an entire vertebrate brain. The benchmark is based on a novel dataset containing 4d light-sheet microscopy recordings of over 70,000 neurons in a larval zebrafish brain, along with motion stabilized and voxel-level cell segmentations of these data that facilitate development of a variety of forecasting methods. Initial results from a selection of time series and volumetric video modeling approaches achieve better performance than naive baseline methods, but also show room for further improvement. The specific brain used in the activity recording is also undergoing synaptic-level anatomical mapping, which will enable future integration of detailed structural information into forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Channel-wise Dynamic Fusion Model: Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting via Entropy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02609v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity is an intrinsic property of real-world time series and plays a crucial role in time series forecasting. Previous studies primarily adopt instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3) producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion \textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module, which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of CDFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Utilizing Sequential Information of General Lab-test Results and Diagnoses History for Differential Diagnosis of Dementia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15317v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) faces multiple data-related challenges, including high variability in patient data, limited access to specialized diagnostic tests, and overreliance on single-type indicators. These challenges are exacerbated by the progressive nature of AD, where subtle pathophysiological changes often precede clinical symptoms by decades. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that takes advantage of routinely collected general laboratory test histories for the early detection and differential diagnosis of AD. By modeling lab test sequences as "sentences", we apply word embedding techniques to capture latent relationships between tests and employ deep time series models, including long-short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to model temporal patterns in patient records. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves diagnostic accuracy and enables scalable and costeffective AD screening in diverse clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Aggregation Strategies for Efficient Annotation of Bioacoustic Sound Events Using Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02422v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast amounts of audio data collected in Sound Event Detection (SED) applications require efficient annotation strategies to enable supervised learning. Manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming, making Active Learning (AL) a promising approach for reducing annotation effort. We introduce Top K Entropy, a novel uncertainty aggregation strategy for AL that prioritizes the most uncertain segments within an audio recording, instead of averaging uncertainty across all segments. This approach enables the selection of entire recordings for annotation, improving efficiency in sparse data scenarios. We compare Top K Entropy to random sampling and Mean Entropy, and show that fewer labels can lead to the same model performance, particularly in datasets with sparse sound events. Evaluations are conducted on audio mixtures of sound recordings from parks with meerkat, dog, and baby crying sound events, representing real-world bioacoustic monitoring scenarios. Using Top K Entropy for active learning, we can achieve comparable performance to training on the fully labeled dataset with only 8% of the labels. Top K Entropy outperforms Mean Entropy, suggesting that it is best to let the most uncertain segments represent the uncertainty of an audio file. The findings highlight the potential of AL for scalable annotation in audio and time-series applications, including bioacoustics.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches based on random convolution kernels, it dynamically selects the best couple of input representations and pooling operator during the training process. SelF-Rocket achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the University of California Riverside (UCR) TSC benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: i...</summary><p>v1: initial version, incorrect evaluation. v2: Method improved, evaluation corrected, title simplified</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric Sequential Change-point Detection on High Order Compositional Time Series Models with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02349v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential change-point detection for time series is widely used in data monitoring in practice. In this work, we focus on sequential change-point detection on high-order compositional time series models. Under the regularity conditions, we prove that a process following the generalized Beta AR(p) model with exogenous variables is stationary and ergodic. We develop a nonparametric sequential change-point detection method for the generalized Beta AR(p) model, which does not rely on any strong assumptions about the sources of the change points. We show that the power of the test converges to one given that the amount of initial observations is large enough. We apply the nonparametric method to a rate of automobile crashes with alcohol involved, which is recorded monthly from January 2010 to December 2020; the exogenous variable is the price level of alcoholic beverages, which has a change point around August 2019. We fit a generalized Beta AR(p) model to the crash rate sequence, and we use the nonparametric sequential change-point detection method to successfully detect the change point.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, unsupervised classification, and similarity searches in high-energy data sets. This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |
| **[SensorQA: A Question Answering Benchmark for Daily-Life Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04974v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth in sensor data, effectively interpreting and interfacing with these data in a human-understandable way has become crucial. While existing research primarily focuses on learning classification models, fewer studies have explored how end users can actively extract useful insights from sensor data, often hindered by the lack of a proper dataset. To address this gap, we introduce SensorQA, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. SensorQA is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/benjamin-reichman/SensorQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Continual Learning Framework for Multivariate Time Series Prediction Tasks with Application to Vehicle State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01669v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15273v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset. The code is made available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/DADA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[FLEXtime: Filterbank learning to explain time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05841v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for explaining predictions from time series involve learning an instance-wise saliency mask for each time step; however, many types of time series are difficult to interpret in the time domain, due to the inherently complex nature of the data. Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio. Code will be made available at https://github.com/theabrusch/FLEXtime.</p></details> |  |

Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576$\times$, resulting in up to 94.8$\%$ fewer FLOPs and 69.6$\%$ acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

| **[ReFocus: Reinforcing Mid-Frequency and Key-Frequency Modeling for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16890v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

| **[Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models, and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Decision-Focused Fine-Tuning of Time Series Foundation Models for Dispatchable Feeder Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01936v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models provide a universal solution for generating forecasts to support optimization problems in energy systems. Those foundation models are typically trained in a prediction-focused manner to maximize forecast quality. In contrast, decision-focused learning directly improves the resulting value of the forecast in downstream optimization rather than merely maximizing forecasting quality. The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem. To obtain more robust predictions for scarce building data, we use Moirai as a state-of-the-art foundation model, which offers robust and generalized results with few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparing the decision-focused fine-tuned Moirai with a state-of-the-art classical prediction-focused fine-tuning Morai, we observe an improvement of 9.45% in average total daily costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OIPR: Evaluation for Time-series Anomaly Detection Inspired by Operator Interest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01260v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of time-series anomaly detection (TAD) technology, numerous studies have employed deep learning-based detectors for analyzing time-series data in the fields of Internet services, industrial systems, and sensors. The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are inadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based metrics tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based metrics are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR, a novel set of TAD evaluation metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling faults, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate the performance of TAD algorithms. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluation methods. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  |

The ultimate goal is to develop an ability to predict the measurement on the wafer surface wear through monitoring the components health state. This translates to cost saving in large scale production. The PHM dataset contains many time series measurements not utilized by traditional physics based approach. On the other hand task, applying a data driven approach such as deep learning to the PHM dataset is non-trivial. The main issue with supervised deep learning is that class label is not available to the PHM dataset. Second, the feature space trained by an unsupervised deep learner is not specifically targeted at the predictive ability or regression. In this work, we propose using the autoencoder based clustering whereby the feature space trained is found to be more suitable for performing regression. This is due to having a more compact distribution of samples respective to their nearest cluster means. We justify our claims by comparing the performance of our proposed method on the PHM dataset with several baselines such as the autoencoder as well as state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing time series foundation models often adopt methodologies from these fields without addressing the unique characteristics of time series data. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in cross-domain time series forecasting: the complexity of temporal patterns and semantic misalignment. To tackle these issues, we propose the ``Unify and Anchor" transfer paradigm, which disentangles frequency components for a unified perspective and incorporates external context as domain anchors for guided adaptation. Based on this framework, we introduce ContexTST, a Transformer-based model that employs a time series coordinator for structured representation and the Transformer blocks with a context-informed mixture-of-experts mechanism for effective cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContexTST advances state-of-the-art forecasting performance while achieving strong zero-shot transferability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables, conference under review</p></details> |

While this strategy avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI approach that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million data dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025), Singapore, 2025</p></details> |

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Diffusion: Learning Temporal Dynamics with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00951v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks by progressively adding noise to data through a forward process and then reversing this process to generate realistic samples. While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics. Through the reparameterization trick, Dynamical Diffusion achieves efficient training and inference similar to any standard diffusion model. Extensive experiments across scientific spatiotemporal forecasting, video prediction, and time series forecasting demonstrate that Dynamical Diffusion consistently improves performance in temporal predictive tasks, filling a crucial gap in existing methodologies.

| **[S4M: S4 for multivariate time series forecasting with Missing values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00900v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, the presence of block missing data introduces significant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and then perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in complex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and represent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two key components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our findings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series forecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research and deployment.

| **[Patch-wise Structural Loss for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00877v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has gained significant attention in machine learning due to its crucial role in various domains. However, most existing forecasting models rely heavily on point-wise loss functions like Mean Square Error, which treat each time step independently and neglect the structural dependencies inherent in time series data, making it challenging to capture complex temporal patterns accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Patch-wise Structural (PS) loss, designed to enhance structural alignment by comparing time series at the patch level. Through leveraging local statistical properties, such as correlation, variance, and mean, PS loss captures nuanced structural discrepancies overlooked by traditional point-wise losses. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with point-wise loss, simultaneously addressing local structural inconsistencies and individual time-step errors. PS loss establishes a novel benchmark for accurately modeling complex time series data and provides a new perspective on time series loss function design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PS loss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

To uniformly predict multidimensional time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for 1D token sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The paradigm formulates various forecasting tasks as a long-context prediction problem. We opt for decoder-only Transformers that capture causal dependencies from varying-length contexts for unified forecasting, making predictions on non-stationary univariate time series, multivariate series with complicated dynamics and correlations, as well as covariate-informed contexts that include exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), which is further enhanced by deft position embedding for temporal causality and variable equivalence. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across task-specific forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for pre-trained time series models.

Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM2022)</p></details> |

Inherently, dynamic network patterns can be complex due to dyadic and temporal dependence, and change points detection can identify the discrepancies in the underlying data generating processes to facilitate downstream analysis. Moreover, the STERGM that utilizes network statistics to represent the structural patterns is a flexible and parsimonious model to fit dynamic networks. We propose a new estimator derived from the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) procedure and Group Fused Lasso (GFL) regularization to simultaneously detect multiple time points, where the parameters of a time-heterogeneous STERGM have changed. We also provide a Bayesian information criterion for model selection and an R package CPDstergm to implement the proposed method. Experiments on simulated and real data show good performance of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our comparative benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Theil's U statistic of 0.1181 (U<1) of MCDFN indicates its superiority over the naive forecasting approach, and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test with a p-value of 5% indicated no significant difference between MCDFN's predictions and actual values. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Echo state network (ESN) is a class of recurrent neural networks that can be used to identify unique patterns in time-series data and predict future events. It is known for minimal computing resource requirements and fast training, owing to the use of linear optimization solely at the readout stage. In this work, a custom-design neuromorphic chip based on ESN targeting edge devices is proposed. The proposed system supports various learning mechanisms, including structural plasticity and synaptic plasticity, locally on-chip. This provides the network with an additional degree of freedom to continuously learn, adapt, and alter its structure and sparsity level, ensuring high performance and continuous stability. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system as well as its robustness to noise against real-world time-series datasets while considering various topologies of data movement. An average accuracy of 95.95% and 85.24% are achieved on human activity recognition and prosthetic finger control, respectively. We also illustrate that the proposed system offers a throughput of 6x10^4 samples/sec with a power consumption of 47.7mW on a 65nm IBM process.</p></details> |  |

Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> | CPAL 2025 |

Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 31 pages |

A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\times$ larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of anomalies in cow activity using wavelet transform based features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21051v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Precision Livestock Farming, detecting deviations from optimal or baseline values - i.e. anomalies in time series - is essential to allow undertaking corrective actions rapidly. Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Monthly Residential Natural Gas Demand Using Just-In-Time-Learning Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20989v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural gas (NG) is relatively a clean source of energy, particularly compared to fossil fuels, and worldwide consumption of NG has been increasing almost linearly in the last two decades. A similar trend can also be seen in Turkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the continuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand (NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts of monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current study, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024 provided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities in Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD forecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series models, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning method. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process Regression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG demand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate features, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values. For each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is used in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately for each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The JITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast errors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art combination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in similar settings.</p></details> |  |

Its origins are multifaceted, resulting in various missing mechanisms. Prior research in this field has predominantly revolved around the assumption of the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanism. However, Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms, though equally prevalent, have often remained underexplored despite their significant influence. This PhD project presents a comprehensive research agenda designed to investigate the implications of diverse missing data mechanisms. The principal aim is to devise robust methodologies capable of effectively handling missing data while accommodating the unique characteristics of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms. By addressing these gaps, this research contributes to an enriched understanding of the challenges posed by missing data across various industries and data modalities. It seeks to provide practical solutions that enable the effective management of missing data, empowering researchers and practitioners to leverage incomplete datasets confidently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented at the ECML PKDD 2024 PhD Forum. https://ecmlpkdd. org/2024/program-accepted-phd-forum/</p></details> |
| **[Concealed Adversarial attacks on neural networks for sequential data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20948v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of deep learning led to the broad usage of neural networks in the time series domain for various applications, including finance and medicine. While powerful, these models are prone to adversarial attacks: a benign targeted perturbation of input data leads to significant changes in a classifier's output. However, formally small attacks in the time series domain become easily detected by the human eye or a simple detector model. We develop a concealed adversarial attack for different time-series models: it provides more realistic perturbations, being hard to detect by a human or model discriminator. To achieve this goal, the proposed adversarial attack maximizes an aggregation of a classifier and a trained discriminator loss. To make the attack stronger, we also propose a training procedure for a discriminator that provides broader coverage of possible attacks. Extensive benchmarking on six UCR time series datasets across four diverse architectures - including recurrent, convolutional, state-space, and transformer-based models - demonstrates the superiority of our attack for a concealability-efficiency trade-off. Our findings highlight the growing challenge of designing robust time series models, emphasizing the need for improved defenses against realistic and effective attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical inference for large-dimensional tensor factor model by iterative projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09800v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor Factor Models (TFM) are appealing dimension reduction tools for high-order large-dimensional tensor time series, and have wide applications in economics, finance and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a projection estimator for the Tucker-decomposition based TFM, and provide its least-square interpretation which parallels to the least-square interpretation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the vector factor model. The projection technique simultaneously reduces the dimensionality of the signal component and the magnitudes of the idiosyncratic component tensor, thus leading to an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio. We derive a convergence rate of the projection estimator of the loadings and the common factor tensor which are faster than that of the naive PCA-based estimator. Our results are obtained under mild conditions which allow the idiosyncratic components to be weakly cross- and auto- correlated. We also provide a novel iterative procedure based on the eigenvalue-ratio principle to determine the factor numbers. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to investigate the empirical performance of the proposed projection estimators relative to the state-of-the-art ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[FACTS: A Factored State-Space Framework For World Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20922v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modelling is essential for understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex systems by learning both spatial and temporal dependencies. However, current frameworks, such as Transformers and selective state-space models like Mambas, exhibit limitations in efficiently encoding spatial and temporal structures, particularly in scenarios requiring long-term high-dimensional sequence modelling. To address these issues, we propose a novel recurrent framework, the \textbf{FACT}ored \textbf{S}tate-space (\textbf{FACTS}) model, for spatial-temporal world modelling. The FACTS framework constructs a graph-structured memory with a routing mechanism that learns permutable memory representations, ensuring invariance to input permutations while adapting through selective state-space propagation. Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel computation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across diverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, object-centric world modelling, and spatial-temporal graph prediction, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms or matches specialised state-of-the-art models, despite its general-purpose world modelling design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released in https://github.com/NanboLi/FACTS</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Optimal Control for Diffusion Bridges in Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20630v5)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Dimensional Knockoffs Inference for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09851v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We make some initial attempt to establish the theoretical and methodological foundation for the model-X knockoffs inference for time series data. We suggest the method of time series knockoffs inference (TSKI) by exploiting the ideas of subsampling and e-values to address the difficulty caused by the serial dependence. We also generalize the robust knockoffs inference in Barber, Cand\`es, and Samworth to the time series setting to relax the assumption of known covariate distribution required by model-X knockoffs, since such an assumption is overly stringent for time series data. We establish sufficient conditions under which TSKI achieves the asymptotic false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our technical analysis reveals the effects of serial dependence and unknown covariate distribution on the FDR control. We conduct a power analysis of TSKI using the Lasso coefficient difference knockoff statistic under the generalized linear time series models. The finite-sample performance of TSKI is illustrated with several simulation examples and an economic inflation study.</p></details> | 106 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data can significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing values, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compact Model for Large-Scale Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which commonly arise in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represent a special category of multivariate time series. They exhibit two distinct characteristics: high dimensionality and commensurability across spatial locations. These attributes call for computationally efficient modeling approaches and facilitate the use of univariate forecasting models in a channel-independent fashion. SparseTSF, a recently introduced competitive univariate forecasting model, harnesses periodicity to achieve compactness by concentrating on cross-period dynamics, thereby extending the Pareto frontier with respect to model size and predictive performance. Nonetheless, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to an inadequate capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this shortcoming, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting module with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model effectively detects recurring patterns in time series through the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, thereby strengthening its ability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while employing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best approaches, thus further extending the Pareto frontier of existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating System 1 vs. 2 Reasoning Approaches for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting: A Benchmark and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01895v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning ability is crucial for solving challenging tasks. With the advancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed, including test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training optimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional Transformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable relationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture complex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or extreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high skewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces PFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target MTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme variability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced Feature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE effectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence subsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing the encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy without the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We evaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key forecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling predictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in water management. PFformer demonstrated remarkable improvements, from 20% to 60%, compared with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>PAKDD...</summary><p>PAKDD 2025 special session on Data Science: Foundations and Applications (DSFA)</p></details> |

To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

Dedicated hardware implementations based on functional neuromorphic structures significantly reduce energy consumption and/or increase computational capabilities of a given artificial neural network system. Concepts of RC, which as a flexible computational paradigm can be highly inclusive, are often used as a model to describe computations performed in materia. With mostly fixed internal structure, solid-state devices, especially memristors, are studied as computational substrates in various RC systems. In this work, we present single-node Echo State Machine (SNESM) RC system based on bridge synapse as a computational substrate (consisting of 4 memristors and a differential amplifier) used for epileptic seizure detection. KNOWM memristors were posed as ideal candidates because of their easy prototyping and reliability of operation. In this account, we present an application of commercially available KNOWM memristors in various neuromorphic applications, from simple analysis of switching and internal dynamics (elucidated form noise spectroscopy and total harmonic distortion analysis) to the classification and recognition of complex time series: epilepsy seizure recognition using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer.</p></details> |  |

Due to the time series data, the use of $\ell_1$ regularization quickly becomes intractable for many solvers, and, despite the reconstruction advantages of $\ell_1$ regularization, $\ell_2$-based approaches such as sLORETA are used in practice. In this work, we formulate EEG source localization as a graphical generalized elastic net inverse problem and present a variable projected algorithm (VPAL) suitable for fast EEG source localization. We prove convergence of this solver for a broad class of separable convex, potentially non-smooth functions subject to linear constraints and include a modification of VPAL that reconstructs time points in sequence, suitable for real-time reconstruction. Our proposed methods are compared to state-of-the-art approaches including sLORETA and other methods for $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Canonical Decomposition of Factor Models: Weak Factors are Everywhere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10067v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two approaches to time series approximate factor models: the static factor model, where the factors are loaded contemporaneously by the common component, and the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model, where the factors are loaded with lags. In this paper we derive a canonical decomposition which nests both models by introducing the weak common component which is the difference between the dynamic- and the static common component. Such component is driven by potentially infinitely many non-pervasive weak factors which live in the dynamically common space (not to be confused with rate-weak factors, being pervasive but associated with a slower rate). Our result shows that the relation between the two approaches is far more rich and complex than what usually assumed. We exemplify why the weak common component shall not be neglected by means of theoretical and empirical examples. Furthermore, we propose a simple estimation procedure for the canonical decomposition. Our empirical estimates on US macroeconomic data reveal that the weak common component can account for a large part of the variation of individual variables. Furthermore in a pseudo real-time forecasting evaluation for industrial production and inflation, we show that gains can be obtained from considering the dynamic approach over the static approach.</p></details> |  |

We represent images as matrix data and allow for temporal dependence, in addition to inherent spatial dependence, before and after the change. The marginal distributions are assumed to be general, not limited to any specific parametric distribution. We propose new monitoring statistics that utilize the low-rank structure of the in-control mean matrix. Additionally, we study the properties of the proposed detection procedure, assessing whether the monitoring statistics effectively capture a mean shift and evaluating the rate of increase in the average run length relative to the control limit in both the in-control and out-of-control cases. The effectiveness of our procedure is demonstrated through simulated and real data experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 main figures, 5 supplementary figures, 2 supplementary tables</p></details> |

By combining the multi-resolution framework of wavelets with the robustness of the Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) criterion, we introduce a periodogram providing a robust alternative to classical methods in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. Incorporating this periodogram into a log-periodogram regression, we develop a new estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) and Wavelet-Based Log-Periodogram (WBLP) estimators, particularly in terms of mean squared error, across various sample sizes and parameter configurations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

The SINDYc model has been trained on data coming from a nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit model for three rotor eccentricity configurations. When evaluating the SINDYc model for static eccentricity, torques and UMPs with excellent accuracies, i.e., 8.8 mNm and 4.87 N of mean absolute error, respectively, are found. When compared with a reference torque equation, this amounts to a 65% error reduction. For dynamic eccentricity, the estimation is more difficult. The SINDYc model is fast enough to be embedded in a control procedure.</p></details> |  |

One of the key challenges is processing sequences with long-range dependencies. To that end, a recent line of work applied the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which partitions the sequence into multiple subsequences and applies a Fourier transform to each separately. We propose the Frequency Information Aggregation (FIA)-Net, which is based on a novel complex-valued MLP architecture that aggregates adjacent window information in the frequency domain. To further increase the receptive field of the FIA-Net, we treat the set of windows as hyper-complex (HC) valued vectors and employ HC algebra to efficiently combine information from all STFT windows altogether. Using the HC-MLP backbone allows for improved handling of sequences with long-term dependence. Furthermore, due to the nature of HC operations, the HC-MLP uses up to three times fewer parameters than the equivalent standard window aggregation method. We evaluate the FIA-Net on various time-series benchmarks and show that the proposed methodologies outperform existing state of the art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/research-1803/.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Forecasting intermittent time series with Gaussian Processes and Tweedie likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19086v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which is both zero-inflated and heavy tailed, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |

Such clinical applications are increasingly supported by machine learning methods, raising the question of the most appropriate input representation and model choice. Comprehensive comparisons, in particular across different input representations, are scarce. We address this gap in the research landscape by a comprehensive benchmarking study covering three kinds of input representations, interpretable features, image representations and raw waveforms, across prototypical regression and classification use cases: blood pressure and atrial fibrillation prediction. In both cases, the best results are achieved by deep neural networks operating on raw time series as input representations. Within this model class, best results are achieved by modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). but depending on the task setup, shallow CNNs are often also very competitive. We envision that these results will be insightful for researchers to guide their choice on machine learning tasks for PPG data, even beyond the use cases presented in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 9 figures, code available at https://gitlab.com/qumphy/d1-code</p></details> |

While recent techniques seek to address this for images, our findings show that these approaches fail to provide shift-invariance in time series, where the data generation mechanism is more challenging due to the interaction of low and high frequencies. Worse, they also decrease performance across several tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable bijective function that maps samples from their high-dimensional data manifold to another manifold of the same dimension, without any dimensional reduction. Our approach guarantees that samples -- when subjected to random shifts -- are mapped to a unique point in the manifold while preserving all task-relevant information without loss. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the proposed transformation guarantees shift-invariance in deep learning models without imposing any limits to the shift. Our experiments on six time series tasks with state-of-the-art methods show that our approach consistently improves the performance while enabling models to achieve complete shift-invariance without modifying or imposing restrictions on the model's topology.

| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Temporal Segmentation for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation: A Keypoint Detection and Temporal Segmentation Approach for Small Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19766v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rehabilitation is essential and critical for post-stroke patients, addressing both physical and cognitive aspects. Stroke predominantly affects older adults, with 75% of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older, underscoring the urgent need for tailored rehabilitation strategies in aging populations. Despite the critical role therapists play in evaluating rehabilitation progress and ensuring the effectiveness of treatment, current assessment methods can often be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to delays in adjusting therapy protocols. This study aims to address these challenges by providing a solution for consistent and timely analysis. Specifically, we perform temporal segmentation of video recordings to capture detailed activities during stroke patients' rehabilitation. The main application scenario motivating this study is the clinical assessment of daily tabletop object interactions, which are crucial for post-stroke physical rehabilitation. To achieve this, we present a framework that leverages the biomechanics of movement during therapy sessions. Our solution divides the process into two main tasks: 2D keypoint detection to track patients' physical movements, and 1D time-series temporal segmentation to analyze these movements over time. This dual approach enables automated labeling with only a limited set of real-world data, addressing the challenges of variability in patient movements and limited dataset availability. By tackling these issues, our method shows strong potential for practical deployment in physical therapy settings, enhancing the speed and accuracy of rehabilitation assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18807v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.4 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 80 chemical systems, 12 operating temperatures, and 646 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in a series of neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.</p></details> | Under review |

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretisation of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures while preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusions with these inversion formulae results in high-quality long time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

Analyzing it involves tasks such as classification, clustering, prototyping, and regression. Classification identifies normal vs. abnormal movements in skeleton-based motion sequences, clustering detects stock market behavior patterns, prototyping expands physical therapy datasets, and regression predicts patient recovery. Deep learning has recently gained traction in time series analysis due to its success in other domains. This thesis leverages deep learning to enhance classification with feature engineering, introduce foundation models, and develop a compact yet state-of-the-art architecture. We also address limited labeled data with self-supervised learning. Our contributions apply to real-world tasks, including human motion analysis for action recognition and rehabilitation. We introduce a generative model for human motion data, valuable for cinematic production and gaming. For prototyping, we propose a shape-based synthetic sample generation method to support regression models when data is scarce. Lastly, we critically evaluate discriminative and generative models, identifying limitations in current methodologies and advocating for a robust, standardized evaluation framework. Our experiments on public datasets provide novel insights and methodologies, advancing time series analysis with practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Bridging these metaphors to anatomically driven Western medical (WM) concepts poses significant challenges for both automated language processing and real-world clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-agent and chain-of-thought (CoT) framework designed to interpret TCM metaphors accurately and map them to WM pathophysiology. Specifically, our approach combines domain-specialized agents (TCM Expert, WM Expert) with a Coordinator Agent, leveraging stepwise chain-of-thought prompts to ensure transparent reasoning and conflict resolution. We detail a methodology for building a metaphor-rich TCM dataset, discuss strategies for effectively integrating multi-agent collaboration and CoT reasoning, and articulate the theoretical underpinnings that guide metaphor interpretation across distinct medical paradigms. We present a comprehensive system design and highlight both the potential benefits and limitations of our approach, while leaving placeholders for future experimental validation. Our work aims to support clinical decision-making, cross-system educational initiatives, and integrated healthcare research, ultimately offering a robust scaffold for reconciling TCM's symbolic language with the mechanistic focus of Western medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Anomaly Event Detection via LLM-guided Symbolic Pattern Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly event detection plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations.

Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

Traditionally, constructing a parametric model to accurately describe binned data has been a manual and iterative process, requiring an adequate functional form to be determined before the fit can be performed. The main challenge arises when the appropriate functional forms cannot be derived from first principles, especially when there is no underlying true closed-form function for the distribution. In this work, we develop a framework that automates and streamlines the process by utilizing symbolic regression, a machine learning technique that explores a vast space of candidate functions without requiring a predefined functional form because the functional form itself is treated as a trainable parameter, making the process far more efficient and effortless than traditional regression methods. We demonstrate the framework in high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using five real proton-proton collision datasets from new physics searches, including background modeling in resonance searches for high-mass dijet, trijet, paired-dijet, diphoton, and dimuon events. We show that our framework can flexibly and efficiently generate a wide range of candidate functions that fit a nontrivial distribution well using a simple fit configuration that varies only by random seed, and that the same fit configuration, which defines a vast function space, can also be applied to distributions of different shapes, whereas achieving a comparable result with traditional methods would have required extensive manual effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 35 figures.

Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

A key challenge for embodied agents is the generalization of knowledge across diverse environments and situations, as limited experiences often confine them to their prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, NeSyC, a neuro-symbolic continual learner that emulates the hypothetico-deductive model by continually formulating and validating knowledge from limited experiences through the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic tools. Specifically, we devise a contrastive generality improvement scheme within NeSyC, which iteratively generates hypotheses using LLMs and conducts contrastive validation via symbolic tools. This scheme reinforces the justification for admissible actions while minimizing the inference of inadmissible ones. Additionally, we incorporate a memory-based monitoring scheme that efficiently detects action errors and triggers the knowledge refinement process across domains. Experiments conducted on diverse embodied task benchmarks-including ALFWorld, VirtualHome, Minecraft, RLBench, and a real-world robotic scenario-demonstrate that NeSyC is highly effective in solving complex embodied tasks across a range of open-domain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The algorithm exploits dynamical symmetries to construct lean abstractions to avoid redundant computations during synthesis. Our proposed algorithm adds another layer of abstraction over the common grid-based discrete abstraction before solving the synthesis problem. It combines each set of grid cells that are at a similar relative position from the targets and nearby obstacles, defined by the symmetries, into a single abstract state. It uses this layer of abstraction to guide the order by which actions are explored during synthesis over the grid-based abstraction. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by synthesizing a reach-avoid controller for a 3-dimensional ship model with translation and rotation symmetries in the special Euclidean group SE(2).</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has shown promise in brain MRI analysis, it often functions as a black box, limiting interpretability and lacking mechanisms to effectively integrate critical clinical data such as biomarkers, medical history, and demographic information. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuroSymAD, a neuro-symbolic framework that synergizes neural networks with symbolic reasoning. A neural network percepts brain MRI scans, while a large language model (LLM) distills medical rules to guide a symbolic system in reasoning over biomarkers and medical history. This structured integration enhances both diagnostic accuracy and explainability. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that NeuroSymAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.91% in accuracy and 3.43% in F1-score while providing transparent and interpretable diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.</p></details> | Submitted to NeuS'25 |

By combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning we develop a model that outperforms purely numerical methods in accuracy and interpretability. Focusing on sextic polynomials with height $\leq 6$, we analyze a database of 53,972 irreducible examples, uncovering novel distributional trends, such as the 20 sextic polynomials with Galois group $C_6$ spanning just seven invariant-defined equivalence classes. These findings offer the first empirical insights into Galois group probabilities under height constraints and lay the groundwork for exploring solvability by radicals. Demonstrating AI's potential to reveal patterns beyond traditional symbolic techniques, this work paves the way for future research in computational algebra, with implications for probabilistic conjectures and higher degree classifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic regression via MDLformer-guided search: from minimizing prediction error to minimizing description length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03753v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression, a task discovering the formula best fitting the given data, is typically based on the heuristical search. These methods usually update candidate formulas to obtain new ones with lower prediction errors iteratively.However, since formulas with similar function shapes may have completely different symbolic forms, the prediction error does not decrease monotonously as the search approaches the target formula, causing the low recovery rate of existing methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel search objective based on the minimum description length, which reflects the distance from the target and decreases monotonically as the search approaches the correct form of the target formula. To estimate the minimum description length of any input data, we design a neural network, MDLformer, which enables robust and scalable estimation through large-scale training. With the MDLformer's output as the search objective, we implement a symbolic regression method, SR4MDL, that can effectively recover the correct mathematical form of the formula. Extensive experiments illustrate its excellent performance in recovering formulas from data. Our method successfully recovers around 50 formulas across two benchmark datasets comprising 133 problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 43.92%.

Inspired by the computational principles of canonical cortical microcircuits, we propose a framework for using recurrent spiking neural networks to seamlessly and robustly switch between analog signal processing and categorical and discrete computation. We provide theoretical analysis and practical neural network design tools to formally determine the conditions for inducing this switch. We demonstrate the robustness of this framework experimentally with hardware soft Winner-Take-All and mixed-feedback recurrent spiking neural networks, implemented by appropriately configuring the analog neuron and synapse circuits of a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor chip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20332v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have found evidence for emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models, but debate persists concerning the robustness of these capabilities, and the extent to which they depend on structured reasoning mechanisms. To shed light on these issues, we perform a comprehensive study of the internal mechanisms that support abstract rule induction in an open-source language model (Llama3-70B). We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proving Olympiad Inequalities by Synergizing LLMs and Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13834v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can prove mathematical theorems formally by generating proof steps (\textit{a.k.a.} tactics) within a proof system. However, the space of possible tactics is vast and complex, while the available training data for formal proofs is limited, posing a significant challenge to LLM-based tactic generation. To address this, we introduce a neuro-symbolic tactic generator that synergizes the mathematical intuition learned by LLMs with domain-specific insights encoded by symbolic methods. The key aspect of this integration is identifying which parts of mathematical reasoning are best suited to LLMs and which to symbolic methods. While the high-level idea of neuro-symbolic integration is broadly applicable to various mathematical problems, in this paper, we focus specifically on Olympiad inequalities (Figure~1). We analyze how humans solve these problems and distill the techniques into two types of tactics: (1) scaling, handled by symbolic methods, and (2) rewriting, handled by LLMs. In addition, we combine symbolic tools with LLMs to prune and rank the proof goals for efficient proof search. We evaluate our framework on 161 challenging inequalities from multiple mathematics competitions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforming existing LLM and symbolic approaches without requiring additional training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

While natural language offers human-accessible flexibility but suffers from ambiguity, symbolic reasoning provides precise, machine-executable inferences at the cost of strict domain constraints. We introduce HYBRIDMIND, an adaptive strategy that selects the optimal reasoning approach for each reasoning problem. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate both prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned open-source models. We find that fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct as a meta-selector outperforms GPT-4o's natural language reasoning by 4.4\% on FOLIO and 1.3\% on MATH. More notably, using GPT-3.5-turbo as a prompted meta-selector yields a 10\% improvement on FOLIO's challenging subset compared to GPT-4o. We will release our code and data to support future research.</p></details> |  |

One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation. However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR. These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data. Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data. As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods. We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in GECCO '24</p></details> |

Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.

One promising approach to achieving this is through neural-symbolic systems, which combine the strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning. However, current methodologies in this area face limitations in integration, generalization, and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a neural-symbolic framework based on statistical relational learning, referred to as NSF-SRL. This framework effectively integrates deep learning models with symbolic reasoning in a mutually beneficial manner.In NSF-SRL, the results of symbolic reasoning are utilized to refine and correct the predictions made by deep learning models, while deep learning models enhance the efficiency of the symbolic reasoning process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance and exhibits effective generalization in supervised learning, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative strategy to evaluate the interpretability of the model's predictions, visualizing the corresponding logic rules that contribute to these predictions and providing insights into the reasoning process. We believe that this approach sets a new standard for neural-symbolic systems and will drive future research in the field of general artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Reasoning refers to drawing new conclusions based on existing knowledge, which can support various applications like clinical diagnosis, basic education, and financial analysis. Though a good number of surveys have been proposed for reviewing reasoning-related methods, none of them has systematically investigated these methods from the viewpoint of their dependent knowledge base. Both the scenarios to which the knowledge bases are applied and their storage formats are significantly different. Hence, investigating reasoning methods from the knowledge base perspective helps us better understand the challenges and future directions. To fill this gap, this paper first classifies the knowledge base into symbolic and parametric ones. The former explicitly stores information in human-readable symbols, and the latter implicitly encodes knowledge within parameters. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of reasoning methods using symbolic knowledge bases, parametric knowledge bases, and both of them. Finally, we identify the future direction toward enhancing reasoning capabilities to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are imperfections in some parts of the paper, which may lead to misunderstandings among readers.

However, challenges such as data scarcity and data imbalance continue to hinder their development. To address this, we consider modeling complex systems through symbolic expressions that serve as semantic descriptors of time series. Building on this concept, we introduce a series-symbol (S2) dual-modulity data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic representations. Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.</p></details> |  |

While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high cost of 3D vision-language datasets. On the other hand, LLM/VLM based agents are proposed for 3DVG, eliminating the need for training data. However, these methods incur prohibitive time and token costs during inference. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel training-free symbolic framework for 3D visual grounding, namely Evolvable Symbolic Visual Grounder, that offers significantly reduced inference costs compared to previous agent-based methods while maintaining comparable performance. EaSe uses LLM generated codes to compute on spatial relationships. EaSe also implements an automatic pipeline to evaluate and optimize the quality of these codes and integrate VLMs to assist in the grounding process. Experimental results demonstrate that EaSe achieves 52.9% accuracy on Nr3D dataset and 49.2% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer, which is top-tier among training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the inference time and cost, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SLAM systems, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

As a promising mitigation, the Low-Dimensional Computing (LDC) method significantly reduces the vector dimension by ~100 times while maintaining accuracy, by employing a gradient-based optimization. Despite its potential, LDC optimization for VSA is still underexplored. Our investigation into vector updates underscores the importance of stable, adaptive dynamics in LDC training. We also reveal the overlooked yet critical roles of batch normalization (BN) and knowledge distillation (KD) in standard approaches. Besides the accuracy boost, BN does not add computational overhead during inference, and KD significantly enhances inference confidence. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across multiple benchmarks, we provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and extend the interpretability of binary neural network optimization similar to LDC, previously unaddressed in BNN literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

We study this problem in the context of reward machines: symbolic tasks that can be formally decomposed into sub-tasks. In order to handle settings without a priori knowledge of the environment, we introduce a framework that can learn the optimal decomposition from model-free interactions with the environment. Our method uses a task-conditioned architecture to simultaneously learn an optimal decomposition and the corresponding agents' policies for each sub-task. In doing so, we remove the need for a human to manually design the optimal decomposition while maintaining the sample-efficiency benefits of improved credit assignment. We provide experimental results in several deep reinforcement learning settings, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Our results indicate that our approach succeeds even in environments with codependent agent dynamics, enabling synchronous multi-agent learning not achievable in previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, main track full paper at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

We argue that complex reasoning tasks are difficult for Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 7B), as these tasks demand not only general cognitive abilities but also specialized knowledge, which is often sparse and difficult for these neural-based SLMs to effectively capture. Therefore, NesyCD distills the general capabilities and specialized knowledge in LLMs using different manners. On the one hand, we distill only general abilities from teacher LLMs into the student SLMs of parameterized neural networks. On the other hand, for the specialized abilities and uncommon knowledge of a complex reasoning task, we employ a symbolic knowledge distillation approach to obtain and store the specialized knowledge within a symbolic knowledge base (KB). By decoupling general and specialized capabilities, the proposed NesyCD can achieve superior performance cost-effectively, utilizing smaller models and blending parameterized neural networks with symbolic KB. Moreover, the specialized KB generalizes well and is comprehended and manipulated by humans. Our experiments show that NesyCD significantly boosts SLMs' complex reasoning performance on in-domain (BBH, GSM8K) and out-of-domain (AGIEval, ARC) datasets. Notably, our approach enabled the LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B to surpass GPT-3.5-turbo in performance and come close to matching LLaMA3-70B, despite the latter having nine times more parameters.

However, achieving human-like reasoning and interpretability in AI systems remains a substantial challenge. The Neural-Symbolic paradigm, which integrates neural networks with symbolic systems, presents a promising pathway toward more interpretable AI. Within this paradigm, Knowledge Graphs (KG) are crucial, offering a structured and dynamic method for representing knowledge through interconnected entities and relationships, typically as triples (subject, predicate, object). This paper explores recent advancements in neural-symbolic integration based on KG, examining how it supports integration in three categories: enhancing the reasoning and interpretability of neural networks with symbolic knowledge (Symbol for Neural), refining the completeness and accuracy of symbolic systems via neural network methodologies (Neural for Symbol), and facilitating their combined application in Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Integration. It highlights current trends and proposes future research directions in Neural-Symbolic AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Smooth Transition Between Induction and Deduction: Fast Abductive Learning Based on Probabilistic Symbol Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12919v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive learning (ABL) that integrates strengths of machine learning and logical reasoning to improve the learning generalization, has been recently shown effective. However, its efficiency is affected by the transition between numerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computational costs in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited. In this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithms for ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbol relationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes, resulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address these challenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as Probabilistic Symbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction and deduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged. We leverage probability as a bridge and present an efficient data structure, achieving the transfer from a continuous probability sequence to discrete Boolean sequences with low computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate the promising results.</p></details> |  |

However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |

The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the continuous camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. However, in this position paper I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both continuous/distributed and symbolic/discrete-like representations and computations; 2) models trained on language make use this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in mechanistic interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it is also what makes them particularly interesting for the study of language and cognition. Is it time for peace?</p></details> | Under review |

In contrast, inductive logic programming (ILP) excels at inferring logical relationships across diverse, sparse and limited datasets, but its discrete nature requires the inputs to be precisely specified, which limits their application. This paper proposes a bridge between the two approaches: neuro-symbolic contrastive learning. This allows for smooth and differentiable optimisation that improves logical accuracy across an otherwise discrete, noisy, and sparse topological space of logical functions. We show that abstract logical relationships can be effectively embedded within a neuro-symbolic paradigm, by representing data as logic programs and sets of logic rules. The embedding space captures highly varied textual information with similar semantic logical relations, but can also separate similar textual relations that have dissimilar logical relations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the inference capabilities of the models in terms of generalisation and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

However, the vast combinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for both online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally, current state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration of domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions with the model during the equation discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale transformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to learn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder, enabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the expression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression to best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly when there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the challenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world cases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design mechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other state-of-the-art models.

| **[SymGPT: Auditing Smart Contracts via Combining Symbolic Execution with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07644v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.04306</p></details> |

To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAMAS...</summary><p>AAMAS 2025 (with Appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Structural Perturbation in Large Language Model Representations through Recursive Symbolic Regeneration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05794v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic perturbations offer a novel approach for influencing neural representations without requiring direct modification of model parameters. The recursive regeneration of symbolic structures introduces structured variations in latent embeddings, leading to controlled shifts in attention dynamics and lexical diversity across sequential generations. A comparative analysis with conventional fine-tuning techniques reveals that structural modifications at the symbolic level induce distinct variations in contextual sensitivity while maintaining overall model fluency and coherence. Shifts in attention weight distributions highlight the role of symbolic modifications in adjusting token dependencies, influencing response variability, and refining long-form text generation. Experimental findings suggest that symbolic perturbations can enhance adaptability in domain-specific applications, allowing modifications in model behavior without retraining. Evaluations of semantic drift indicate that recursive regeneration alters long-range token dependencies, affecting topic coherence across extended text sequences. Results from lexical variability assessments further support the conclusion that symbolic-level modifications introduce interpretable variations in generated responses, potentially enabling more controlled stylistic adjustments in automated text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-symbolic Training for Reasoning over Spatial Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13828v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning based on natural language expressions is essential for everyday human tasks. This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

However, for complex learning targets, NeSy systems often generate outputs inconsistent with domain knowledge and it is challenging to rectify them. Inspired by the human Cognitive Reflection, which promptly detects errors in our intuitive response and revises them by invoking the System 2 reasoning, we propose to improve NeSy systems by introducing Abductive Reflection (ABL-Refl) based on the Abductive Learning (ABL) framework. ABL-Refl leverages domain knowledge to abduce a reflection vector during training, which can then flag potential errors in the neural network outputs and invoke abduction to rectify them and generate consistent outputs during inference. ABL-Refl is highly efficient in contrast to previous ABL implementations. Experiments show that ABL-Refl outperforms state-of-the-art NeSy methods, achieving excellent accuracy with fewer training resources and enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025, Oral</p></details> |

To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domain, achieving over 50% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report v1 (32 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |

There are two types of data-driven ROM closures in current use: (i) structural, with simple ansatzes (e.g., linear or quadratic); and (ii) machine learning-based, with neural network ansatzes. We propose a novel symbolic regression (SR) data-driven ROM closure strategy, which combines the advantages of current approaches and eliminates their drawbacks. As a result, the new data-driven SR closures yield ROMs that are interpretable, parsimonious, accurate, generalizable, and robust. To compare the data-driven SR-ROM closures with the structural and machine learning-based ROM closures, we consider the data-driven variational multiscale ROM framework and two under-resolved, convection-dominated test problems: the flow past a cylinder and the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds numbers Re = 10000, 15000, and 20000. This numerical investigation shows that the new data-driven SR-ROM closures yield more accurate and robust ROMs than the structural and machine learning ROM closures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing a Vision-Language-Action Model for Symbolic States and Integration into a Cognitive Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04558v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold promise as generalist robotics solutions by translating visual and linguistic inputs into robot actions, yet they lack reliability due to their black-box nature and sensitivity to environmental changes. In contrast, cognitive architectures (CA) excel in symbolic reasoning and state monitoring but are constrained by rigid predefined execution. This work bridges these approaches by probing OpenVLA's hidden layers to uncover symbolic representations of object properties, relations, and action states, enabling integration with a CA for enhanced interpretability and robustness. Through experiments on LIBERO-spatial pick-and-place tasks, we analyze the encoding of symbolic states across different layers of OpenVLA's Llama backbone. Our probing results show consistently high accuracies (> 0.90) for both object and action states across most layers, though contrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe the expected pattern of object states being encoded earlier than action states. We demonstrate an integrated DIARC-OpenVLA system that leverages these symbolic representations for real-time state monitoring, laying the foundation for more interpretable and reliable robotic manipulation.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 4 Figures |

Although a wide-variety of SR methods have been developed, they often face challenges such as high computational cost, poor scalability with respect to the number of input dimensions, fragility to noise, and an inability to balance accuracy and complexity. This work introduces SyMANTIC, a novel SR algorithm that addresses these challenges. SyMANTIC efficiently identifies (potentially several) low-dimensional descriptors from a large set of candidates (from $\sim 10^5$ to $\sim 10^{10}$ or more) through a unique combination of mutual information-based feature selection, adaptive feature expansion, and recursively applied $\ell_0$-based sparse regression. In addition, it employs an information-theoretic measure to produce an approximate set of Pareto-optimal equations, each offering the best-found accuracy for a given complexity. Furthermore, our open-source implementation of SyMANTIC, built on the PyTorch ecosystem, facilitates easy installation and GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SyMANTIC across a range of problems, including synthetic examples, scientific benchmarks, real-world material property predictions, and chaotic dynamical system identification from small datasets. Extensive comparisons show that SyMANTIC uncovers similar or more accurate models at a fraction of the cost of existing SR methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main and SI compiled into the pdf Main:48 pages, 7 figures SI: 29 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

In the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that it is $\mathrm{NP}^{\# \mathrm{P}}$-hard. To overcome this issue, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving dataset, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities and network sizes.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present regression- and neural-based models that learn to predict the values that the inconsistency measures $\incmi$ and $\incat$ would assign to propositional logic knowledge bases. Our main motivation is that computing these values conventionally can be hard complexity-wise. As an important addition, we use specific postulates, that is, properties, of the underlying inconsistency measures to infer symbolic rules, which we combine with the learning-based models in the form of constraints. We perform various experiments and show that a) predicting the degree values is feasible in many situations, and b) including the symbolic constraints deduced from the rationality postulates increases the prediction quality.</p></details> |  |

Among different methods for structured reasoning, we specifically focus on backward chaining, where the proof goal is recursively decomposed to subgoals by searching and applying rules. We argue that current LLM-based backward chaining systems (e.g. Least-to-most prompting and LAMBADA) are incomplete, as they omit crucial algorithmic components identified from the classic backward chaining algorithm in computational logic (SLD Resolution). To this end, we propose a novel backward chaining system, SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining), which integrates a symbolic solver and an LLM. In SymBa, the solver controls the proof process, and the LLM is only called when the solver requires new information to complete the proof. Empowered by completeness, SymBa achieves a significant improvement in seven deductive, relational, and arithmetic reasoning benchmarks compared to the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (8 pages for main text),11 figures</p></details> |

Learning about the environment is especially important to perform various multiple-step tasks without having to redefine an agent's action set for different tasks or environment settings. In our work, we augment an existing task and motion planning framework with learned affordance models of objects in the world to enable planning and executing multi-step tasks using learned models. Each task can be seen as changing the current state of the world to a given goal state. The affordance models provide us with what actions are possible and how to perform those actions in any given state. A symbolic planning algorithm uses this information and the starting and goal state to create a feasible plan to reach the desired goal state to complete a given task. We demonstrate our approach in a virtual 3D photorealistic environment, AI2-Thor, and evaluate it on real-world tasks. Our results show that our agent quickly learns how to interact with the environment and is well prepared to perform tasks such as "Moving an object out of the way to reach the desired location."</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-round supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks.

| **[Symbolic State Partitioning for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16791v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular reinforcement learning methods cannot operate directly on continuous state spaces. One solution for this problem is to partition the state space. A good partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient exploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes faster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces approximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear relations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as possible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given problem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by symbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space coverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement learning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space partitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance and state space coverage for the learnt policies.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs \textit{time-aware memorization} through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate \textit{neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning}, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> |  |

Their application, however, is limited as finding these solutions is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we combine two key insights. First, constructing an analytical solution requires a composition of foundational solution components. Second, iterative solvers define parameterized function spaces with constraint-based updates. Our approach merges compositional differential equation solution techniques with iterative refinement by using formal grammars, building a rich space of candidate solutions that are embedded into a low-dimensional (continuous) latent manifold for probabilistic exploration. This integration unifies numerical and symbolic differential equation solvers via a neuro-symbolic AI framework to find analytical solutions of a wide variety of differential equations. By systematically constructing candidate expressions and applying constraint-based refinement, we overcome longstanding barriers to extract such closed-form solutions. We illustrate advantages over commercial solvers, symbolic methods, and approximate neural networks on a diverse set of problems, demonstrating both generality and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we consider the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, which typically suffers from high complexity as it requires the computation of the symbol-wise posterior distributions in every iteration. We address this issue by efficiently approximating the posteriors using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a suitable factor graph. By interweaving the iterations of BP and EM, the detection complexity can be further reduced to a single BP iteration per EM step. In addition, we propose a data-driven version of our algorithm that introduces momentum in the BP updates and learns a suitable EM parameter update schedule, thereby significantly improving the performance-complexity tradeoff with a few offline training samples. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed blind detector and show that it even outperforms coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |

Existing symbolic methods predominantly rely on fixed, pre-collected training datasets, which often result in suboptimal performance, as demonstrated in our case study in Figure 1. Drawing inspiration from active learning, we investigate strategies to query informative trajectory data that can enhance the evaluation of predicted ODEs. However, the butterfly effect in dynamical systems reveals that small variations in initial conditions can lead to drastically different trajectories, necessitating the storage of vast quantities of trajectory data using conventional active learning. To address this, we introduce Active Symbolic Discovery of Ordinary Differential Equations via Phase Portrait Sketching (APPS). Instead of directly selecting individual initial conditions, our APPS first identifies an informative region within the phase space and then samples a batch of initial conditions from this region. Compared to traditional active learning methods, APPS mitigates the gap of maintaining a large amount of data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APPS consistently discovers more accurate ODE expressions than baseline methods using passively collected datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Version of the Paper Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, as one of the first in the symbolic music literature's demo pages that enables real-time interactive generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constructing Fundamentals for the Theory of Proportions and Symbolic Allusions Applied Interdisciplinarily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00780v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Theory of Proportions and Symbolic Allusions applied Interdisciplinary (TPASAI) is a framework that integrates mathematics, linguistics, psychology, and game theory to uncover hidden patterns and proportions in reality. Its central idea is that numerical encoding of symbols, dates, and language can reveal recurring structures and connections that reflect universal principles. By applying fractal analysis, the theory identifies patterns across different scales, offering a unifying perspective on the structure of the world. One key aspect of TPASAI is symbolic analysis, which allows for the reinterpretation of traumatic experiences in psychotherapy. For example, assigning numerical values to elements like fingers, dates, or words can help individuals uncover meaningful associations between personal experiences and collective symbols. This approach encourages cognitive flexibility and provides a therapeutic avenue for recontextualizing emotions. The theory also incorporates principles of game theory, which frame reality as a system of symbolic "codes" governed by rules that can be understood and strategically used. This perspective is especially useful for psychological conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), enabling patients to approach their obsessions as decipherable patterns rather than rigid constraints. TPASAI has practical applications in psychology, education, and technology. In education, it aids in teaching mathematical and linguistic concepts by exploring connections between symbolic representations and real-world events. In technology, the methodology can be employed in ciphering and natural language processing. The innovation of TPASAI lies in its ability to merge the structured rigor of mathematics with the interpretative flexibility of symbolic analysis, offering a deeper understanding of events and relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, interdisciplinarity</p></details> |

Recent studies successfully performed symbolic reasoning by leveraging various machine learning models to explicitly or implicitly predict intermediate labels that provide symbolic instructions. However, these intermediate labels are not always prepared for every task as a part of training data, and pre-trained models, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), also do not consistently generate valid symbolic instructions with their intrinsic knowledge. On the other hand, existing work developed alternative learning techniques that allow the learning system to autonomously uncover optimal symbolic instructions. Nevertheless, their performance also exhibits limitations when faced with relatively huge search spaces or more challenging reasoning problems. In view of this, in this work, we put forward an advanced practice for neuro-symbolic reasoning systems to explore the intermediate labels with weak supervision from problem inputs and final outputs. Our experiments on the Mathematics dataset illustrated the effectiveness of our proposals from multiple aspects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning of Flexible Policies for Symbolic Instructions with Adjustable Mapping Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18848v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic task representation is a powerful tool for encoding human instructions and domain knowledge. Such instructions guide robots to accomplish diverse objectives and meet constraints through reinforcement learning (RL). Most existing methods are based on fixed mappings from environmental states to symbols. However, in inspection tasks, where equipment conditions must be evaluated from multiple perspectives to avoid errors of oversight, robots must fulfill the same symbol from different states. To help robots respond to flexible symbol mapping, we propose representing symbols and their mapping specifications separately within an RL policy. This approach imposes on RL policy to learn combinations of symbolic instructions and mapping specifications, requiring an efficient learning framework. To cope with this issue, we introduce an approach for learning flexible policies called Symbolic Instructions with Adjustable Mapping Specifications (SIAMS). This paper represents symbolic instructions using linear temporal logic (LTL), a formal language that can be easily integrated into RL. Our method addresses the diversified completion patterns of instructions by (1) a specification-aware state modulation, which embeds differences in mapping specifications in state features, and (2) a symbol-number-based task curriculum, which gradually provides tasks according to the learning's progress. Evaluations in 3D simulations with discrete and continuous action spaces demonstrate that our method outperforms context-aware multitask RL comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18479v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In standard genetic programming (stdGP), solutions are varied by modifying their syntax, with uncertain effects on their semantics. Geometric-semantic genetic programming (GSGP), a popular variant of GP, effectively searches the semantic solution space using variation operations based on linear combinations, although it results in significantly larger solutions. This paper presents Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP), a novel and flexible semantic approach that uses a generative transformer model as search operator. The transformer is trained on synthetic test problems and learns semantic similarities between solutions. Once the model is trained, it can be used to create offspring solutions with high semantic similarity also for unseen and unknown problems. Experiments on several symbolic regression problems show that TSGP generates solutions with comparable or even significantly better prediction quality than stdGP, SLIM_GSGP, DSR, and DAE-GP. Like SLIM_GSGP, TSGP is able to create new solutions that are semantically similar without creating solutions of large size. An analysis of the search dynamic reveals that the solutions generated by TSGP are semantically more similar than the solutions generated by the benchmark approaches allowing a better exploration of the semantic solution space.</p></details> |  |

The lack of declarativeness is caused by the functional nature of neural predicates inherited from neural networks. We propose and implement a general framework for fully declarative neural predicates, which hence extends to fully declarative NeSy frameworks. We first show that the declarative extension preserves the learning and reasoning capabilities while being able to answer arbitrary queries while only being trained on a single query type.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a formal framework based on symbolic compression,integrating combinatory logic, information-theoretic optimal encoding, and context-aware inference techniques to achieve a step-change improvement in token efficiency while preserving semantic integrity. We establish a mathematical framework within a functional programming paradigm, derive the quantitative relationship between symbolic density and model interpretability, and propose a differentiable compression factor metric to evaluate encoding efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to achieve a low-cost application of the GAEL language. Experimental results show that this method achieves a 78.3% token compression rate in code generation tasks while improving logical traceability by 62% through structural explicitness. This research provides new theoretical tools for efficient inference in LLMs and opens a symbolic path for modelinterpretability research.</p></details> |  |

Symbolic regression (SR) automates the search for non-linear regression models, delivering a set of hypotheses that balances accuracy with the possibility to understand the phenomena. Many SR implementations return a Pareto front allowing the choice of the best trade-off. However, this hides alternatives that are close to non-domination, limiting these choices. Equality graphs (e-graphs) allow to represent large sets of expressions compactly by efficiently handling duplicated parts occurring in multiple expressions. E-graphs allow to store and query all SR solution candidates visited in one or multiple GP runs efficiently and open the possibility to analyse much larger sets of SR solution candidates. We introduce rEGGression, a tool using e-graphs to enable the exploration of a large set of symbolic expressions which provides querying, filtering, and pattern matching features creating an interactive experience to gain insights about SR models. The main highlight is its focus in the exploration of the building blocks found during the search that can help the experts to find insights about the studied phenomena.This is possible by exploiting the pattern matching capability of the e-graph data structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression with Equality Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17848v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for symbolic regression models with genetic programming (GP) has a tendency of revisiting expressions in their original or equivalent forms. Repeatedly evaluating equivalent expressions is inefficient, as it does not immediately lead to better solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms require diversity and should allow the accumulation of inactive building blocks that can play an important role at a later point. The equality graph is a data structure capable of compactly storing expressions and their equivalent forms allowing an efficient verification of whether an expression has been visited in any of their stored equivalent forms. We exploit the e-graph to adapt the subtree operators to reduce the chances of revisiting expressions. Our adaptation, called eggp, stores every visited expression in the e-graph, allowing us to filter out from the available selection of subtrees all the combinations that would create already visited expressions. Results show that, for small expressions, this approach improves the performance of a simple GP algorithm to compete with PySR and Operon without increasing computational cost. As a highlight, eggp was capable of reliably delivering short and at the same time accurate models for a selected set of benchmarks from SRBench and a set of real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

We introduce a pragmatic method to estimate model complexity using Hessian rank for post-processing selection. Complexity is approximated by averaging the model output Hessian rank across a few points (N=3), offering efficient and accurate rank estimates. This method aligns model selection with input data complexity, calculated using intrinsic dimensionality (ID) estimators. Using the StackGP system, we develop symbolic regression models for the Penn Machine Learning Benchmark and employ twelve scikit-dimension library methods to estimate ID, aligning model expressiveness with dataset ID. Our data-informed complexity metric finds the ideal complexity window, balancing model expressiveness and accuracy, enhancing generalizability without bias common in methods reliant on user-defined parameters, such as parsimony pressure in weight selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to GECCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Interpretability and Accuracy in Neuro-Symbolic Rule Extraction Using Class-Specific Sparse Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16677v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been significant focus on creating neuro-symbolic models for interpretable image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These methods aim to replace the CNN with a neuro-symbolic model consisting of the CNN, which is used as a feature extractor, and an interpretable rule-set extracted from the CNN itself. While these approaches provide interpretability through the extracted rule-set, they often compromise accuracy compared to the original CNN model. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this accuracy loss as the post-training binarization of filter activations to extract the rule-set. To address this, we propose a novel sparsity loss function that enables class-specific filter binarization during CNN training, thus minimizing information loss when extracting the rule-set. We evaluate several training strategies with our novel sparsity loss, analyzing their effectiveness and providing guidance on their appropriate use. Notably, we set a new benchmark, achieving a 9% improvement in accuracy and a 53% reduction in rule-set size on average, compared to the previous SOTA, while coming within 3% of the original CNN's accuracy. This highlights the significant potential of interpretable neuro-symbolic models as viable alternatives to black-box CNNs.</p></details> |  |

| **[On Parallelism in Music and Language: A Perspective from Symbol Emergence Systems based on Probabilistic Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15721v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music and language are structurally similar. Such structural similarity is often explained by generative processes. This paper describes the recent development of probabilistic generative models (PGMs) for language learning and symbol emergence in robotics. Symbol emergence in robotics aims to develop a robot that can adapt to real-world environments and human linguistic communications and acquire language from sensorimotor information alone (i.e., in an unsupervised manner). This is regarded as a constructive approach to symbol emergence systems. To this end, a series of PGMs have been developed, including those for simultaneous phoneme and word discovery, lexical acquisition, object and spatial concept formation, and the emergence of a symbol system. By extending the models, a symbol emergence system comprising a multi-agent system in which a symbol system emerges is revealed to be modeled using PGMs. In this model, symbol emergence can be regarded as collective predictive coding. This paper expands on this idea by combining the theory that ''emotion is based on the predictive coding of interoceptive signals'' and ''symbol emergence systems,'' and describes the possible hypothesis of the emergence of meaning in music.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imperative Learning: A Self-supervised Neuro-Symbolic Learning Framework for Robot Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16087v5)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural-Symbolic Message Passing with Dynamic Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14661v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Recently, a line of message-passing-based research has been proposed to solve CQA. However, they perform unsatisfactorily on negative queries and fail to address the noisy messages between variable nodes in the query graph. Moreover, they offer little interpretability and require complex query data and resource-intensive training. In this paper, we propose a Neural-Symbolic Message Passing (NSMP) framework based on pre-trained neural link predictors. By introducing symbolic reasoning and fuzzy logic, NSMP can generalize to arbitrary existential first order logic queries without requiring training while providing interpretable answers. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy to filter out noisy messages between variable nodes. Experimental results show that NSMP achieves a strong performance. Additionally, through complexity analysis and empirical verification, we demonstrate the superiority of NSMP in inference time over the current state-of-the-art neural-symbolic method. Compared to this approach, NSMP demonstrates faster inference times across all query types on benchmark datasets, with speedup ranging from 2$\times$ to over 150$\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[VERUS-LM: a Versatile Framework for Combining LLMs with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14540v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> |  |

We consider as symbolic any language being intelligible and interpretable for both humans and computers. Accordingly, we propose general meta-models for both SKE and SKI, along with two taxonomies for the classification of SKE and SKI methods. By adopting an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) perspective, we highlight how such methods can be exploited to mitigate the aforementioned opacity issue. Our taxonomies are attained by surveying and classifying existing methods from the literature, following a systematic approach, and by generalising the results of previous surveys targeting specific sub-topics of either SKE or SKI alone. More precisely, we analyse 132 methods for SKE and 117 methods for SKI, and we categorise them according to their purpose, operation, expected input/output data and predictor types. For each method, we also indicate the presence/lack of runnable software implementations. Our work may be of interest for data scientists aiming at selecting the most adequate SKE/SKI method for their needs, and also work as suggestions for researchers interested in filling the gaps of the current state of the art, as well as for developers willing to implement SKE/SKI-based technologies.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, sperm whale populations are categorized into clans based on their vocal repertoire: the rhythmically patterned click sequences (codas) that they use. Among these codas, identity codas function as symbolic markers for each clan, accounting for 35-60% of codas they produce. We introduce a computational method to model whale speech, which encodes rhythmic micro-variations within codas, capturing their vocal style. We find that vocal style-clans closely align with repertoire-clans. However, contrary to vocal repertoire, we show that sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, i.e. most codas, suggesting social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, this subcoda structure model offers a framework for comparing communication systems in other species, with potential implications for deeper understanding of vocal and cultural transmission within animal societies.</p></details> |  |

The generated Inverse Kinematics is generalized to a family of manipulators with the same Degree of Freedom (DOF), but varying link length configurations. The results indicate a position error of less than 1.0 cm for 3 DOF and 4.5 cm for 5 DOF, and orientation error of 2$^\circ$ for 3 DOF and 8.2$^\circ$ for 6 DOF, which allows the deployment to certain real world-problems. However, out-of-domain errors and lack of extrapolation can be observed in the resulting GNN. An extensive analysis of these errors indicates potential for enhancement in the future. Consequently, the generated GNNs are tailored to be used in future work as an inductive bias to generate analytical equations through symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |

Anthropomorphized symbol motions can convey rich and nuanced social interactions; Toyteller leverages these motions (1) to let users steer story text generation and (2) as a visual output format that accompanies story text. We enabled motion-steered text generation and text-steered motion generation by mapping motions and text onto a shared semantic space so that large language models and motion generation models can use it as a translational layer. Technical evaluations showed that Toyteller outperforms a competitive baseline, GPT-4o. Our user study identified that toy-playing helps express intentions difficult to verbalize. However, only motions could not express all user intentions, suggesting combining it with other modalities like language. We discuss the design space of toy-playing interactions and implications for technical HCI research on human-AI interaction.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI2025 |

In this paper, we develop a hierarchical symbolic control architecture for autonomous docking maneuvers of a dynamic positioning vessel, to provide formal safety guarantees. At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then transmitted to and executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. Given a synthesized symbolic controller, we investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme for the docking task. The efficacy of this methodology is evaluated on a low-fidelity simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scaled model vessel.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyNav: Visual Neuro-Symbolic Friction Learning for Off-road Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12654v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-road navigation is essential for a wide range of applications in field robotics such as planetary exploration and disaster response. However, it remains an unresolved challenge due to the unstructured environments and inherent complexity of terrain-vehicle interactions. Traditional physics-based methods struggle to accurately model the nonlinear dynamics of these interactions, while data-driven approaches often suffer from overfitting to specific motion patterns, vehicle sizes, and types, limiting their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a vision-based friction estimation framework grounded in neuro-symbolic principles, integrating neural networks for visual perception with symbolic reasoning for physical modeling. This enables significantly improved generalization abilities through explicit physical reasoning incorporating the predicted friction. Additionally, we develop a physics-informed planner that leverages the learned friction coefficient to generate physically feasible and efficient paths, along with corresponding speed profiles. We refer to our approach as AnyNav and evaluate it in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its utility and robustness across various off-road scenarios and multiple types of four-wheeled vehicles. These results mark an important step toward developing neuro-symbolic spatial intelligence to reason about complex, unstructured environments and enable autonomous off-road navigation in challenging scenarios. Video demonstrations are available at https://sairlab.org/anynav/, where the source code will also be released.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a Systematic Abductive Reasoning model with diverse relation representations (Rel-SAR) in Vector-symbolic Architecture (VSA) to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). To derive attribute representations with symbolic reasoning potential, we introduce not only various types of atomic vectors that represent numeric, periodic and logical semantics, but also the structured high-dimentional representation (SHDR) for the overall Grid component. For systematic reasoning, we propose novel numerical and logical relation functions and perform rule abduction and execution in a unified framework that integrates these relation representations. Experimental results demonstrate that Rel-SAR achieves significant improvement on RPM tasks and exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization. Rel-SAR leverages the synergy between HD attribute representations and symbolic reasoning to achieve systematic abductive reasoning with both interpretable and computable semantics.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |
| **[On Memorization of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles. Our code and data are available at https://memkklogic.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although existing CLQA algorithms achieve high accuracy in answering such queries, their reasoning time and memory usage scale significantly with the number of First-Order Logic (FOL) operators involved, creating serious challenges for practical deployment. In addition, current research primarily focuses on algorithm-level optimizations for CLQA tasks, often overlooking compiler-level optimizations, which can offer greater generality and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a Knowledge Graph Compiler, namely KGCompiler, the first deep learning compiler specifically designed for CLQA tasks. By incorporating KG-specific optimizations proposed in this paper, KGCompiler enhances the reasoning performance of CLQA algorithms without requiring additional manual modifications to their implementations. At the same time, it significantly reduces memory usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KGCompiler accelerates CLQA algorithms by factors ranging from 1.04x to 8.26x, with an average speedup of 3.71x. We also provide an interface to enable hands-on experience with KGCompiler.</p></details> |  |

A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have examined the impact of factors such as data volume and model size on English models, the scaling properties of instruction tuning in other languages remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of data quantity, model size, and data construction methods on instruction tuning for Chinese LLMs. We utilize a newly curated dataset, DoIT, which includes over 40,000 high-quality instruction instances covering ten underlying abilities, such as creative writing, code generation, and logical reasoning. Our experiments, conducted on models ranging from 7b to 33b parameters, yield three key findings: (i) While these factors directly affect overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, whereas others demonstrate significant resistance.

| **[Subtle Errors Matter: Preference Learning via Error-injected Self-editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06638v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong mathematical reasoning prowess, tackling tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced competition-level problems. However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Meet Symbolic Provers for Logical Reasoning Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>First-order logic (FOL) reasoning, which involves sequential deduction, is pivotal for intelligent systems and serves as a valuable task for evaluating reasoning capabilities, particularly in chain-of-thought (CoT) contexts. Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

Most previous works have focused on learning entity/relation embeddings and simulating first-order logic operators with various neural networks. However, they are bottlenecked by the inability to share world knowledge to improve logical reasoning, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a complex reasoning schema over KG upon large language models (LLMs), containing a curriculum-based logical-aware instruction tuning framework, named LACT. Specifically, we augment the arbitrary first-order logical queries via binary tree decomposition, to stimulate the reasoning capability of LLMs. To address the difficulty gap among different types of complex queries, we design a simple and flexible logic-aware curriculum learning framework. Experiments across widely used datasets demonstrate that LACT has substantial improvements~(brings an average +5.5% MRR score) over advanced methods, achieving the new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[FCoReBench: Can Large Language Models Solve Challenging First-Order Combinatorial Reasoning Problems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02611v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can the large language models (LLMs) solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems such as graph coloring, knapsack, and cryptarithmetic? By first-order, we mean these problems can be instantiated with potentially an infinite number of problem instances of varying sizes. They are also challenging being NP-hard and requiring several reasoning steps to reach a solution. While existing work has focused on coming up with datasets with hard benchmarks, there is limited work which exploits the first-order nature of the problem structure. To address this challenge, we present FCoReBench, a dataset of 40 such challenging problems, along with scripts to generate problem instances of varying sizes and automatically verify and generate their solutions. We first observe that LLMs, even when aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset, being unable to leverage the underlying structure of these problems. We specifically observe a drop in performance with increasing problem size. In response, we propose a new approach, SymPro-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers and program interpreters, along with feedback from a few solved examples, to achieve huge performance gains. Our proposed approach is robust to changes in the problem size, and has the unique characteristic of not requiring any LLM call during inference time, unlike earlier approaches. As an additional experiment, we also demonstrate SymPro-LM's effectiveness on other logical reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses - a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitate an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are threefold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, especially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts. We have made our source code and benchmarks available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Order Doesn't Matter, But Reasoning Does: Training LLMs with Order-Centric Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19907v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and coherent inference. However, LLMs struggle with reasoning order variations and fail to generalize across logically equivalent transformations. LLMs often rely on fixed sequential patterns rather than true logical understanding. To address this issue, we introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on commutativity in logical reasoning. We first randomly shuffle independent premises to introduce condition order augmentation. For reasoning steps, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between steps, which allows us to identify valid reorderings of steps while preserving logical correctness. By leveraging order-centric augmentations, models can develop a more flexible and generalized reasoning process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning performance and adaptability to diverse logical structures. We release our codes and augmented data in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Order-Centric-Data-Augmentation-822C/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Image Generation Guided by Chains of Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16965v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autoregressive (AR) image generation, models based on the 'next-token prediction' paradigm of LLMs have shown comparable performance to diffusion models by reducing inductive biases. However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the structure and details of the image, impacting the accuracy and stability of generation. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as a key reasoning capability of LLMs, utilizes reasoning prompts to guide the model, improving reasoning performance on complex natural language process (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation, and helping the model maintain contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by CoT from the field of NLP, we propose autoregressive Image Generation with Thoughtful Reasoning (IGTR) to enhance autoregressive image generation. IGTR adds reasoning prompts without modifying the model structure or raster generation order. Specifically, we design specialized image-related reasoning prompts for AR image generation to simulate the human reasoning process, which enhances contextual reasoning by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Magic of Code Reasoning through Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13170v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities are one of the most enigmatic and captivating aspects of large language models (LLMs). Numerous studies are dedicated to exploring and expanding the boundaries of this reasoning capability. However, tasks that embody both reasoning and recall characteristics are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce such a novel task, code reasoning, to provide a new perspective for the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We summarize three meta-benchmarks based on established forms of logical reasoning, and instantiate these into eight specific benchmark tasks. Our testing on these benchmarks reveals that LLMs continue to struggle with identifying satisfactory reasoning pathways. Additionally, we present a new pathway exploration pipeline inspired by human intricate problem-solving methods. This Reflective Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment (RHDA) pipeline consists of the following iterative steps: (1) Proposing potential hypotheses based on observations and decomposing them; (2) Utilizing tools to validate hypotheses and reflection outcomes; (3) Revising hypothesis in light of observations. Our approach effectively mitigates logical chain collapses arising from forgetting or hallucination issues in multi-step reasoning, resulting in performance gains of up to $3\times$. Finally, we expanded this pipeline by applying it to simulate complex household tasks in real-world scenarios, specifically in VirtualHome, enhancing the handling of failure cases. We release our code and all of results at https://github.com/TnTWoW/code_reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Poster;23 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TextGames, an innovative benchmark specifically crafted to assess LLMs through demanding text-based games that require advanced skills in pattern recognition, spatial awareness, arithmetic, and logical reasoning. Our analysis probes LLMs' performance in both single-turn and multi-turn reasoning, and their abilities in leveraging feedback to correct subsequent answers through self-reflection. Our findings reveal that, although LLMs exhibit proficiency in addressing most easy and medium-level problems, they face significant challenges with more difficult tasks. In contrast, humans are capable of solving all tasks when given sufficient time. Moreover, we observe that LLMs show improved performance in multi-turn predictions through self-reflection, yet they still struggle with sequencing, counting, and following complex rules consistently. Additionally, models optimized for reasoning outperform pre-trained LLMs that prioritize instruction following, highlighting the crucial role of reasoning skills in addressing highly complex problems.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Slow-...</summary><p>Slow-thinking, Large Language Models, Human-like Reasoning, Decision Making in AI, AGI</p></details> |
| **[Sphere Neural-Networks for Rational Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like communication, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training data, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic unification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this issue, neurosymbolic approaches incorporate a symbolic solver. Specifically, an LLM only translates a natural language problem into a satisfiability (SAT) problem that consists of first-order logic formulas, and a sound symbolic solver returns a mathematically correct solution. However, we discover that LLMs have difficulties to capture complex logical semantics hidden in the natural language during translation. To resolve this limitation, we propose a Compositional First-Order Logic Translation. An LLM first parses a natural language sentence into newly defined logical dependency structures that consist of an atomic subsentence and its dependents, then sequentially translate the parsed subsentences. Since multiple logical dependency structures and sequential translations are possible for a single sentence, we also introduce two Verification algorithms to ensure more reliable results. We utilize an SAT solver to rigorously compare semantics of generated first-order logic formulas and select the most probable one. We evaluate the proposed method, dubbed CLOVER, on seven logical reasoning benchmarks and show that it outperforms the previous neurosymbolic approaches and achieves new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

Current methods typically use text embeddings to measure semantic similarity, which often introduces bias in multi-step reasoning tasks. This occurs because text embeddings contain irrelevant semantic information and lack deeper reasoning structures. To address this, we propose GraphIC, a graph-based retrieval model that leverages reasoning-aware representation and specialized similarity metric for in-context example retrieval. GraphIC first constructs thought graphs-directed, node-attributed graphs that explicitly model reasoning steps and their dependencies-for candidate examples and queries. This approach filters out superficial semantics while preserving essential reasoning processes. Next, GraphIC retrieves examples using a novel similarity metric tailored for these graphs, capturing sequential reasoning patterns and asymmetry between examples. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms 10 baseline methods. Our results highlight the importance of reasoning-aware retrieval in ICL, offering a robust solution for enhancing LLM performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning, empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the multidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and provides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making LLMs Reason? The Intermediate Language Problem in Neurosymbolic Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17216v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning tasks manifest themselves as a challenge to Large Language Models (LLMs). Neurosymbolic approaches use LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems formulated in natural language into a formal intermediate language. Subsequently, the usage of symbolic reasoners yields reliable solving thereof. However, LLMs often fail in translation due to poorly chosen intermediate languages. We introduce the intermediate language problem, which is the problem of choosing a suitable formal language representation for neurosymbolic approaches. Theoretically, we argue that its origins lie in the inability of LLMs to distinguish syntax from semantics and the relative independence of the problem from its representation. We showcase its existence experimentally by contrasting two intermediate languages, Answer Set Programming and the Python Knowledge Engine. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of varying degrees of supplementary context information. Our results show a maximum difference in overall-accuracy of 53.20% and 49.26% in execution-accuracy. When using the GPT4o-mini LLM we beat the state-of-the-art in overall-accuracy on the ProntoQA dataset by 21.20% and by 50.50% on the ProofWriter dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the evaluations supporting these claims often involve simple retrieval tasks or synthetic tasks padded with irrelevant text, which the models may easily detect and discard. In this work, we generate lengthy simplified English text with first-order logic representations spanning up to 2048 clauses (around 25k GPT-4 tokens). We formulate an evaluation task with evidence retrieval for contradiction detection. The long, homogeneous text is filled with distractors that are both hard to distinguish from relevant evidences and provably not interfering with them. Our evaluation of evidence retrieval shows that the effective context window is much smaller with realistic distractors, already crumbling at 128 clauses.</p></details> |  |

Although Chain-of-Thought prompting has improved logical reasoning by enabling models to generate intermediate steps, it lacks mechanisms to assess the coherence of these logical transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight evaluation strategy for logical reasoning that uses query-key alignments inside transformer attention heads. By computing a single forward pass and extracting a "QK-score" from carefully chosen heads, our method reveals latent representations that reliably separate valid from invalid inferences, offering a scalable alternative to traditional ablation-based techniques. We also provide an empirical validation on multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness of our evaluation method against distractors and increased reasoning depth. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of models, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.</p></details> |  |

Another line of work adopt LLM-free declarative solvers to do the reasoning task, rendering higher reasoning accuracy but lacking interpretability due to the black-box nature of the solvers. Aiming to resolve the trade-off between answer accuracy and interpretability, we present a simple extension to the latter line of work. Specifically, we showcase that the intermediate search logs generated by Prolog interpreters can be accessed and interpreted into human-readable reasoning proofs. As long as LLMs correctly translate problem descriptions into Prolog representations, the corresponding reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable. On two logical reasoning and one arithmetic reasoning datasets, our framework obtains significant improvements in terms of both answer accuracy and reasoning proof accuracy.

To obtain more accurate assessments of models' reasoning capabilities, we propose an automated method for synthesizing open-ended logic puzzles, and use it to develop a bilingual benchmark, AutoLogi. Our approach features program-based verification and controllable difficulty levels, enabling more reliable evaluation that better distinguishes models' reasoning abilities. Extensive evaluation of eight modern LLMs shows that AutoLogi can better reflect true model capabilities, with performance scores spanning from 35% to 73% compared to the narrower range of 21% to 37% on the source multiple-choice dataset. Beyond benchmark creation, this synthesis method can generate high-quality training data by incorporating program verifiers into the rejection sampling process, enabling systematic enhancement of LLMs' reasoning capabilities across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.02439</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Scoring Processes: Dissecting the Differences between LLMs and Human Graders in Automatic Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18328v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results underscore the need for a nuanced approach when applying LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Technology, Knowledge, and Learning (TKNL)</p></details> |
| **[Flow of Reasoning:Training LLMs for Divergent Problem Solving with Minimal Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05673v4)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04937v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossVTON: Mimicking the Logic Reasoning on Cross-category Virtual Try-on guided by Tri-zone Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14373v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in image-based virtual try-on systems, generating realistic and robust fitting images for cross-category virtual try-on remains a challenging task. The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triangulating LLM Progress through Benchmarks, Games, and Cognitive Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14359v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine three evaluation paradigms: large question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We use this method to automatically create several datasets consisting of questions asking for the truth or falsity of first-order logic statements in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. While the resolution of these questions does not require any knowledge beyond basic notation of first-order logic and set theory, it does require a degree of planning and logical reasoning, which can be controlled up to arbitrarily high difficulty by the complexity of the generated statements. Furthermore, we do extensive evaluations of the performance of various large language models, including recent models such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini, on these datasets. All of the datasets along with the code used for generating them, as well as all data from the evaluations is publicly available at https://github.com/bkuckuck/logical-skills-of-llms.</p></details> | 67 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Learning from Committee: Reasoning Distillation from a Mixture of Teachers with Peer-Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03663v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning capabilities typically emerge in large language models (LLMs) with tens of billions of parameters, recent research focuses on improving smaller open-source models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. However, many of these studies rely solely on responses from a single LLM as the gold rationale, unlike the natural human learning process, which involves understanding both the correct answers and the reasons behind mistakes. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware DistIllation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SPPD: Self-training with Process Preference Learning Using Dynamic Value Margin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13516v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, enhancing the numerical and logical reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a research hotspot. Existing methods face several limitations: inference-phase techniques (e.g., Chain of Thoughts) rely on prompt selection and the pretrained knowledge; sentence-level Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with step-wise mathematical correctness and depend on stronger models distillation or human annotations; while Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches incur high GPU memory costs and unstable training. To address these, we propose \textbf{S}elf-training framework integrating \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{P}reference learning using \textbf{D}ynamic value margin (SPPD). SPPD leverages a process-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman optimality equation to derive \textbf{dynamic value margin} on step-level preference optimization, which employs tree-based self-sampling on model responses \textbf{without any distillation} from other models. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that SPPD is \textbf{equivalent to on-policy policy gradient methods} under reward constraints. Experiments on 7B-scale models demonstrate superior performance across in-domain and out-domain mathematical benchmarks. We open-source our code at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SSDPO-D-DCDD}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SPPD-DCDD}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15806v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

| **[Detecting LLM Fact-conflicting Hallucinations Enhanced by Temporal-logic-based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13416v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) face the challenge of hallucinations -- outputs that seem coherent but are actually incorrect. A particularly damaging type is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where generated content contradicts established facts. Addressing FCH presents three main challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and maintaining large-scale benchmark datasets is difficult and resource-intensive; 2) Generating complex and efficient test cases that the LLM has not been trained on -- especially those involving intricate temporal features -- is challenging, yet crucial for eliciting hallucinations; and 3) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, particularly with complex logical relationships, as it requires transparency in the model's decision-making process. This paper presents Drowzee, an innovative end-to-end metamorphic testing framework that utilizes temporal logic to identify fact-conflicting hallucinations (FCH) in large language models (LLMs). Drowzee builds a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia and uses automated temporal-logic reasoning to convert this knowledge into a large, extensible set of test cases with ground truth answers. LLMs are tested using these cases through template-based prompts, which require them to generate both answers and reasoning steps. To validate the reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that compare the semantic structure of LLM outputs to the ground truths. Across nine LLMs in nine different knowledge domains, experimental results show that Drowzee effectively identifies rates of non-temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%, and rates of temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 16.7% to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, under review. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.00648</p></details> |
| **[Deliberate Reasoning in Language Models as Structure-Aware Planning with an Accurate World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03136v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Smooth Transition Between Induction and Deduction: Fast Abductive Learning Based on Probabilistic Symbol Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12919v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive learning (ABL) that integrates strengths of machine learning and logical reasoning to improve the learning generalization, has been recently shown effective. However, its efficiency is affected by the transition between numerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computational costs in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited. In this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithms for ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbol relationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes, resulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address these challenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as Probabilistic Symbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction and deduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged. We leverage probability as a bridge and present an efficient data structure, achieving the transfer from a continuous probability sequence to discrete Boolean sequences with low computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate the promising results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in inference-time techniques demonstrate the potential to enhance LLM reasoning without additional training by exploring intermediate steps during inference. Notably, OpenAI's o1 model shows promising performance through its novel use of multi-step reasoning and verification. Here, we explore how scaling inference-time techniques can improve reasoning and planning, focusing on understanding the tradeoff between computational cost and performance. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, known as Sys2Bench, and perform extensive experiments evaluating existing inference-time techniques on eleven diverse tasks across five categories, including arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, common sense reasoning, algorithmic reasoning, and planning. Our findings indicate that simply scaling inference-time computation has limitations, as no single inference-time technique consistently performs well across all reasoning and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose HopRAG, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, HopRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections established via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a retrieve-reason-prune mechanism: starting with lexically or semantically similar passages, the system explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to identify truly relevant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate HopRAG's superiority, achieving 76.78\% higher answer accuracy and 65.07\% improved retrieval F1 score compared to conventional methods.

| **[Large Language Models Might Not Care What You Are Saying: Prompt Format Beats Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08780v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the help of in-context learning (ICL), large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various tasks. However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code will be publicly available once this paper is published.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warmup Generations: A Task-Agnostic Approach for Guiding Sequence-to-Sequence Learning with Unsupervised Initial State Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12304v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategies for sequence-to-sequence tasks often train models to directly generate the target output. Recent work has shown that guiding models with intermediate steps, such as keywords, outlines, or reasoning chains, can significantly improve performance, coherence, and interpretability. However, these methods often depend on predefined intermediate formats and annotated data, limiting their scalability and generalizability. In this work, we introduce a task-agnostic framework that enables models to generate intermediate "warmup" sequences. These warmup sequences, serving as an initial state for subsequent generation, are optimized to enhance the probability of generating the target sequence without relying on external supervision or human-designed structures. Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles, our method iteratively refines these intermediate steps to maximize their contribution to the final output, similar to reward-driven optimization in reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experimental results across tasks such as translation, summarization, and multi-choice question answering for logical reasoning show that our approach outperforms traditional SFT methods, and offers a scalable and flexible solution for sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Expert Knowledge into Logical Programs via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12275v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical forms should be considered as important factors. In addition, we show similarities and discrepancies between the logical reasoning performances of humans and LLMs by collecting and comparing behavioral data from both.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models. Our code and data will be published at https:/dxzxy12138.github.io/PhysReason.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mechanistic Interpretation of Syllogistic Reasoning in Auto-Regressive Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08590v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on logical reasoning in Language Models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether they can learn systematic reasoning principles during pre-training or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. This paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic reasoning in LMs to advance the understanding of internal dynamics. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at interpreting content-independent reasoning mechanisms. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic reasoning, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes, model sizes and architectures, finding that the identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for the schemes on which the models achieve high downstream accuracy (> 60%), and that the activation patterns apply to models of different families. Overall, our findings suggest that LMs indeed learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalizable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.</p></details> |  |

While there is some work on this problem, the explanations provided by existing approaches often lack critical information or fail to be expressive enough for non-binary conflicts. In this paper, we identify structural weaknesses of the state-of-the-art and propose a generic argumentation-based approach to address these problems. This approach is defined for logics involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets and shows how any such logic can be translated to argumentation. Our work provides dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures to compute and explain a query answer wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics. This allows us to construct dialectical proof trees as explanations, which are more expressive and arguably more intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 gigures, journal</p></details> |
| **[Reversal of Thought: Enhancing Large Language Models with Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning Warm-up](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12323v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in reasoning tasks but face limitations in mathematical and complex logical reasoning. Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exposing Numeracy Gaps: A Benchmark to Evaluate Fundamental Numerical Abilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11075v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and semantic understanding. However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/NumericBench.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 7.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies have demonstrated that these models implicitly embed reasoning trees, humans typically employ various distinct logical reasoning mechanisms to complete the same task. It is still unclear which multi-step reasoning mechanisms are used by language models to solve such tasks. In this paper, we aim to address this question by investigating the mechanistic interpretability of language models, particularly in the context of multi-step reasoning tasks. Specifically, we employ circuit analysis and self-influence functions to evaluate the changing importance of each token throughout the reasoning process, allowing us to map the reasoning paths adopted by the model. We apply this methodology to the GPT-2 model on a prediction task (IOI) and demonstrate that the underlying circuits reveal a human-interpretable reasoning process used by the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL2025</p></details> |

Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The LLM Language Network: A Neuroscientific Approach for Identifying Causally Task-Relevant Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02280v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities on not just language tasks, but also various tasks that are not linguistic in nature, such as logical reasoning and social inference. In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

However, logical reasoning that ontologies can directly support are quite limited in learning, approximation and prediction. One straightforward solution is to integrate statistical analysis and machine learning. To this end, automatically learning vector representation for knowledge of an ontology i.e., ontology embedding has been widely investigated. Numerous papers have been published on ontology embedding, but a lack of systematic reviews hinders researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of this field. To bridge this gap, we write this survey paper, which first introduces different kinds of semantics of ontologies and formally defines ontology embedding as well as its property of faithfulness. Based on this, it systematically categorizes and analyses a relatively complete set of over 80 papers, according to the ontologies they aim at and their technical solutions including geometric modeling, sequence modeling and graph propagation. This survey also introduces the applications of ontology embedding in ontology engineering, machine learning augmentation and life sciences, presents a new library mOWL and discusses the challenges and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A com...</summary><p>A comprehensive survey on ontology embedding</p></details> |

These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API "get_info_api" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

As an application combining logical reasoning using Prolog and natural language processing using large language models (LLMs), this paper presents a novel approach and system, LogicLease, to automate the analysis of landlord-tenant legal cases in the state of New York. LogicLease determines compliance with relevant legal requirements by analyzing case descriptions and citing all relevant laws. It leverages LLMs for information extraction and Prolog for legal reasoning. By separating information extraction from legal reasoning, LogicLease achieves greater transparency and control over the legal logic applied to each case. We evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of LogicLease through a series of tests, achieving 100% accuracy and an average processing time of 2.57 seconds. LogicLease presents advantages over state-of-the-art LLM-based legal analysis systems by providing clear, step-by-step reasoning, citing specific laws, and distinguishing itself by its ability to avoid hallucinations -- a common issue in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

However, their ability to perform rigorous logical reasoning remains an open question. This survey synthesizes recent advancements in logical reasoning within LLMs, a critical area of AI research. It outlines the scope of logical reasoning in LLMs, its theoretical foundations, and the benchmarks used to evaluate reasoning proficiency. We analyze existing capabilities across different reasoning paradigms - deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical - and assess strategies to enhance reasoning performance, including data-centric tuning, reinforcement learning, decoding strategies, and neuro-symbolic approaches. The review concludes with future directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration to strengthen logical reasoning in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMWM: Dual-Mind World Model with Long-Term Imagination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07591v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagination in world models is crucial for enabling agents to learn long-horizon policy in a sample-efficient manner. Existing recurrent state-space model (RSSM)-based world models depend on single-step statistical inference to capture the environment dynamics, and, hence, they are unable to perform long-term imagination tasks due to the accumulation of prediction errors. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose a novel dual-mind world model (DMWM) framework that integrates logical reasoning to enable imagination with logical consistency. DMWM is composed of two components: an RSSM-based System 1 (RSSM-S1) component that handles state transitions in an intuitive manner and a logic-integrated neural network-based System 2 (LINN-S2) component that guides the imagination process through hierarchical deep logical reasoning. The inter-system feedback mechanism is designed to ensure that the imagination process follows the logical rules of the real environment. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark tasks that require long-term planning from the DMControl suite. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields significant improvements in terms of logical coherence, trial efficiency, data efficiency and long-term imagination over the state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Reformation of Large Language Model Neuron Encapsulation for Divergent Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07124v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured neuron encapsulation introduces a modular framework that enables more effective aggregation and specialization of information within deep learning architectures. A model modified through this framework demonstrated improved perplexity scores, greater lexical variability, and enhanced consistency in logical reasoning, suggesting that structured parameter distribution contributes to more efficient language representation. Statistical analyses of generated text highlighted a wider range of sentence structures and reduced redundancy in token selection, indicating that encapsulation fosters more adaptable language generation. A detailed evaluation of attention weight distributions revealed that the experimental model exhibited greater divergence in cross-layer activations, supporting the hypothesis that encapsulated neurons assume specialized processing roles. Logical consistency assessments further demonstrated that modular architectures mitigate contradictory outputs, reducing internal conflicts in inferred relationships between linguistic constructs. Computational trade-offs were analyzed, with results showing a minor increase in processing overhead, though improvements in parameter efficiency and structured decision-making compensated for the additional complexity. The mathematical formulation of the encapsulation mechanism confirmed that modular aggregation maintains stable convergence properties while promoting distinct functional roles for different neuron clusters.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not programs, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics (i.e: Hoare Logic). Reasoning about infinite traces and automata can be fairly low-level, requiring complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a modular approach to the verification of general temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call Ticl. Using Ticl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform modular proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, shared memory and distributed consensus, exhibiting a low program-to-proof ratio.</p></details> |  |

Currently, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the mission of nuclear fusion has also entered a critical period of its development. How to let more people to understand nuclear fusion and join in its research is one of the effective means to accelerate the implementation of fusion. This paper proposes the first large model in the field of nuclear fusion, XiHeFusion, which is obtained through supervised fine-tuning based on the open-source large model Qwen2.5-14B. We have collected multi-source knowledge about nuclear fusion tasks to support the training of this model, including the common crawl, eBooks, arXiv, dissertation, etc. After the model has mastered the knowledge of the nuclear fusion field, we further used the chain of thought to enhance its logical reasoning ability, making XiHeFusion able to provide more accurate and logical answers. In addition, we propose a test questionnaire containing 180+ questions to assess the conversational ability of this science popularization large model. Extensive experimental results show that our nuclear fusion dialogue model, XiHeFusion, can perform well in answering science popularization knowledge. The pre-trained XiHeFusion model is released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/XiHeFusion.</p></details> |  |

A Study in SAT Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07432v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formally study the logical reasoning capabilities of decoder-only Transformers in the context of the boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. First, we prove by construction that decoder-only Transformers can decide 3-SAT, in a non-uniform model of computation, using backtracking and deduction via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). %We prove its correctness by showing trace equivalence to the well-known DPLL SAT-solving algorithm. Second, we implement our construction as a PyTorch model with a tool (PARAT) that we designed to empirically demonstrate its correctness and investigate its properties. Third, rather than \textit{programming} a transformer to reason, we evaluate empirically whether it can be \textit{trained} to do so by learning directly from algorithmic traces (``reasoning paths'') from our theoretical construction. The trained models demonstrate strong out-of-distribution generalization on problem sizes seen during training but has limited length generalization, which is consistent with the implications of our theoretical result</p></details> | 41 pages, 4 Figures |

While Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, self-consistency (SC) and self-correction strategies have attempted to guide models in sequential, multi-step reasoning, Multi-agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a viable approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By increasing both the number of agents and the frequency of debates, the performance of LLMs improves significantly. However, this strategy results in a significant increase in token costs, presenting a barrier to scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel sparsification strategy designed to reduce token costs within MAD. This approach minimizes ineffective exchanges of information and unproductive discussions among agents, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the debate process. We conduct comparative experiments on multiple datasets across various models, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces the token costs in MAD to a considerable extent. Specifically, compared to MAD, our approach achieves an impressive reduction of up to 94.5\% in token costs while maintaining performance degradation below 2.0\%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, Accepted to NAACL2025</p></details> |

This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications.

Prior researches have primarily focused on enhancing logical reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or data augmentation. However, previous work constructing chain-of-thought rationales concentrates solely on analyzing correct options, neglecting the incorrect alternatives. Addtionally, earlier efforts on data augmentation by altering contexts rely on rule-based methods, which result in generated contexts that lack diversity and coherence. To address these issues, we propose a Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation (PODA) framework. This framework can generate CoT rationales including analyses for both correct and incorrect options, while constructing diverse and high-quality counterfactual contexts from incorrect candidate options. We integrate summarizing premises and identifying premises for each option into rationales. Subsequently, we employ multi-step prompts with identified premises to construct counterfactual context. To facilitate the model's capabilities to better differentiate the reasoning process associated with each option, we introduce a novel thought-path contrastive learning method that compares reasoning paths between the original and counterfactual samples. Experimental results on three representative LLMs demonstrate that our method can improve the baselines substantially across two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks (ReClor and LogiQA 2.0).

LLMs were tested on legal reasoning tasks involving rule analysis and analogical reasoning. The results show that LLMs can conduct basic IRAC analysis, but are limited by brief responses lacking detail, an inability to commit to answers, false confidence, and hallucinations. The study compares legal and nonlegal LLMs, identifies shortcomings, and explores traits that may hinder their ability to think like a lawyer. It also discusses the implications for legal education and practice, highlighting the need for critical thinking skills in future lawyers and the potential pitfalls of overreliance on artificial intelligence AI resulting in a loss of logic, reasoning, and critical thinking skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Standard Neural Computation Alone Is Insufficient for Logical Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02135v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks, as currently designed, fall short of achieving true logical intelligence. Modern AI models rely on standard neural computation-inner-product-based transformations and nonlinear activations-to approximate patterns from data. While effective for inductive learning, this architecture lacks the structural guarantees necessary for deductive inference and logical consistency. As a result, deep networks struggle with rule-based reasoning, structured generalization, and interpretability without extensive post-hoc modifications. This position paper argues that standard neural layers must be fundamentally rethought to integrate logical reasoning. We advocate for Logical Neural Units (LNUs)-modular components that embed differentiable approximations of logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) directly within neural architectures. We critique existing neurosymbolic approaches, highlight the limitations of standard neural computation for logical inference, and present LNUs as a necessary paradigm shift in AI.

| **[SIMPLOT: Enhancing Chart Question Answering by Distilling Essentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00021v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning has emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning.

To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty. Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://huggingface.co/spaces/WildEval/ZebraLogic</p></details> |

This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .</p></details> |  |

This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes. We construct an affine calculus for 1-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers. Examples of reasoning in the logic include proofs of upper bounds on distances of processes. We also show how our logic can express coupling proofs - a powerful technique for comparing probabilistic processes.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a formal framework based on symbolic compression,integrating combinatory logic, information-theoretic optimal encoding, and context-aware inference techniques to achieve a step-change improvement in token efficiency while preserving semantic integrity. We establish a mathematical framework within a functional programming paradigm, derive the quantitative relationship between symbolic density and model interpretability, and propose a differentiable compression factor metric to evaluate encoding efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to achieve a low-cost application of the GAEL language. Experimental results show that this method achieves a 78.3% token compression rate in code generation tasks while improving logical traceability by 62% through structural explicitness. This research provides new theoretical tools for efficient inference in LLMs and opens a symbolic path for modelinterpretability research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

Debate fundamentally allows multiple viewpoints to be brought up in problem-solving, and for complex problems, each viewpoint opens a new path for problem-solving. In this work, we apply this concept to LLM decision-making by proposing town hall-style debate prompting (THDP), a prompting method that splices a language model into multiple personas that will debate one another to reach a conclusion. Our experimental pipeline varies both the number of personas and the personality types of each persona to find the optimum town hall size and personality for benchmark performance as measured by ZebraLogic bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark characterized by both multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. Our experimental results demonstrate that a town hall size of 5 personas with LLM-determined personality types performs optimally on ZebraLogic, achieving a 13\% improvement over one-shot CoT baselines in per-cell accuracy in GPT-4o, 9% puzzle accuracy increase in Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and an improvement in hard puzzle accuracy from 10-15%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SoCal NLP Symposium 2024</p></details> |

Traditional approaches, limited by their training on specific performance metrics for predefined scenarios, struggle to generalize across diverse faults and anomalies in varying network environments. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various domains. Building on this success, we propose NetSemantic, a plug-and-play intelligent network fault diagnosis framework based on LLMs. NetSemantic transforms multimodal network information into unified textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and generate efficient fault resolutions and health assessment reports. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method that transforms logically strong network information into symbols. Additionally, we propose a self-adaptive data updating mechanism that dynamically incorporates network information into a knowledge graph to ensure the validity and timeliness of the knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that NetSemantic excels in network fault diagnosis across various complex scenarios, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | 10 pages,10 figures |

In this work, we define the novel task of routing an end-user query to the appropriate data-source, where the data-sources are databases. We synthesize datasets by extending existing datasets designed for NL-to-SQL semantic parsing. We create baselines on these datasets by using open-source LLMs, using both pre-trained and task specific embeddings fine-tuned using the training data. With these baselines we demonstrate that open-source LLMs perform better than embedding based approach, but suffer from token length limitations. Embedding based approaches benefit from task specific fine-tuning, more so when there is availability of data in terms of database specific questions for training. We further find that the task becomes more difficult (i) with an increase in the number of data-sources, (ii) having data-sources closer in terms of their domains,(iii) having databases without external domain knowledge required to interpret its entities and (iv) with ambiguous and complex queries requiring more fine-grained understanding of the data-sources or logical reasoning for routing to an appropriate source. This calls for the need for developing more sophisticated solutions to better address the task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st Workshop on GenAI and RAG Systems for Enterprise at CIKM 2024 Conference. 10 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024 as Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as an Indirect Reasoner: Contrapositive and Contradiction for Automated Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03667v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, increasing attention has been focused on improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. Advanced methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants, are found to enhance their reasoning skills by designing suitable prompts or breaking down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems. However, little concentration has been put on exploring the reasoning process, \textit{i.e.}, we discovered that most methods resort to Direct Reasoning (DR) and disregard Indirect Reasoning (IR). This can make LLMs difficult to solve IR tasks, which are often encountered in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a Direct-Indirect Reasoning (DIR) method, which considers DR and IR as multiple parallel reasoning paths that are merged to derive the final answer. We stimulate LLMs to implement IR by crafting prompt templates incorporating the principles of contrapositive and contradiction. These templates trigger LLMs to assume the negation of the conclusion as true, combine it with the premises to deduce a conclusion, and utilize the logical equivalence of the contrapositive to enhance their comprehension of the rules used in the reasoning process. Our DIR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing variants of CoT methods. Experimental results on four datasets related to logical reasoning and mathematic proof demonstrate that our DIR method, when combined with various baseline methods, significantly outperforms all the original methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[SedarEval: Automated Evaluation using Self-Adaptive Rubrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15595v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called SedarEval, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. SedarEval consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach. We release our dataset at https://github.com/wwn1233/sedareval.</p></details> |  |

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that most state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs perform significantly worse than the human average, demonstrating substantial room for model improvement.

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics with Human Judgement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text predicates, often goes unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of sensitivity of existing metrics and their alignment with human judgement on FOL evaluation. Using ground-truth FOLs, we carefully designed various perturbations on the ground-truth to assess metric sensitivity. We sample FOL translation candidates for natural language statements and measure the ranking alignment between automatic metrics and human annotators. Our empirical findings highlight oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations, the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural perturbations, and FOL metric for operator perturbation. We also observe a closer alignment between BertScore and human judgement. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both alignment and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/RamyaKeerthy/AlignmentFOL</p></details> |

While post hoc explanation methods attempt to address this issue, they often fail to accurately represent these black-box models, resulting in misleading or incomplete explanations. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inherently transparent model architecture called Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), which enable compositional and interpretable predictions through logical reasoning. In particular, an NPC consists of two modules: an attribute recognition model, which predicts probabilities for various attributes, and a task predictor built on a probabilistic circuit, which enables logical reasoning over recognized attributes to make class predictions. To train NPCs, we introduce a three-stage training algorithm comprising attribute recognition, circuit construction, and joint optimization. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that an NPC's error is upper-bounded by a linear combination of the errors from its modules. To further demonstrate the interpretability of NPC, we provide both the most probable explanations and the counterfactual explanations. Empirical results on four benchmark datasets show that NPCs strike a balance between interpretability and performance, achieving results competitive even with those of end-to-end black-box models while providing enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, their generalisation and robustness when performing logical reasoning has not been sufficiently assessed. To comprehensively evaluate this ability, we develop three new logical reasoning datasets named "ReClor-plus", "LogiQA-plus" and "LogiQAv2-plus" that extend standard logical reasoning datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LLM's reasoning. For each, we create three subsets: the first with randomly shuffled options, the second with the correct choices replaced by "none of the other options is correct", and the third with a combination of shuffling and substitution. Experiments on these datasets show that these simple augmentations greatly hinder the models' performance. Despite their high performance on the original publicly available datasets, we find that all models perform poorly on these newly constructed datasets. We also demonstrate that introducing task variations into the training set can markedly improve the model's performance on both the original and our developed datasets. Finally, we show that applying logic-driven data augmentation for fine-tuning and prompting can enhance generalisation in both discriminative and generative models, offering a path to improving their robustness for tasks involving logical reasoning.

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

In neuroscience, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems have evolved considerably with the popularization of visual language models. In this paper, we propose LeapVAD, a novel method based on cognitive perception and dual-process thinking. Our approach implements a human-attentional mechanism to identify and focus on critical traffic elements that influence driving decisions. By characterizing these objects through comprehensive attributes - including appearance, motion patterns, and associated risks - LeapVAD achieves more effective environmental representation and streamlines the decision-making process. Furthermore, LeapVAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module miming the human-driving learning process. The system consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) that accumulates driving experience through logical reasoning and a Heuristic Process (System-I) that refines this knowledge via fine-tuning and few-shot learning. LeapVAD also includes reflective mechanisms and a growing memory bank, enabling it to learn from past mistakes and continuously improve its performance in a closed-loop environment. To enhance efficiency, we develop a scene encoder network that generates compact scene representations for rapid retrieval of relevant driving experiences. Extensive evaluations conducted on two leading autonomous driving simulators, CARLA and DriveArena, demonstrate that LeapVAD achieves superior performance compared to camera-only approaches despite limited training data. Comprehensive ablation studies further emphasize its effectiveness in continuous learning and domain adaptation. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/LeapVAD/.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial. Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks. However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided. Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning? In this paper, we propose Reasoning with Graphs (RwG) by first constructing explicit graphs from the context and then leveraging these graphs to enhance LLM reasoning performance on reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering tasks.</p></details> |  |

These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |
