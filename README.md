| **[Breaking the O(mn)-Time Barrier for Vertex-Weighted Global Minimum Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11926v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem: given an undirected vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a minimum-weight subset of its vertices whose removal disconnects $G$. The problem is closely related to Global Minimum Edge-Cut, where the weights are on the graph edges instead of vertices, and the goal is to compute a minimum-weight subset of edges whose removal disconnects the graph. Global Minimum Cut is one of the most basic and extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. While an almost-linear time algorithm was known for the edge version of the problem for awhile (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), the fastest previous algorithm for the vertex version (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) achieves a running time of $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. For the special case of unit vertex weights, this bound was broken only recently (Li {et al.}, STOC 2021); their result, combined with the recent breakthrough almost-linear time algorithm for Maximum $s$-$t$ Flow (Chen {et al.}, FOCS 2022, van den Brand {et al.}, FOCS 2023), yields an almost-linear time algorithm for Global Minimum Vertex-Cut with unit vertex weights. In this paper we break the $28$ years old bound of Henzinger {et al.} for the general weighted Global Minimum Vertex-Cut, by providing a randomized algorithm for the problem with running time $O(\min\{mn^{0.99+o(1)},m^{1.5+o(1)}\})$.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15196v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/HeurAgenix.</p></details> | 27 pages,9 figures |
| **[Synthesizing Composite Hierarchical Structure from Symbolic Music Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15849v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI '25), Montreal, Canada, August 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the solvable-unsolvable transition due to noise-induced chaos in digital memcomputing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14928v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have been designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11422v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristics have achieved great success in solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Given the fact that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content, and a knowledge base that covers various domains, which offer a novel way to automatically optimize heuristics. Therefore, we propose Planning of Heuristics (PoH), an optimization method that integrates the self-reflection of LLMs with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics (states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions (actions) and evaluation results (rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). The experimental results show that PoH outperforms other hand-crafted heuristics and Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) by other LLMs-based methods, and achieves the significant improvements and the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve COPs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Boosting Generalization in Diffusion-Based Neural Combinatorial Solver via Inference Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12188v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GreedyPrune: Retenting Critical Visual Token Set for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13166v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image understanding tasks, their computational efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly on resource-constrained devices due to the high cost of processing large numbers of visual tokens. Recently, training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity. We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complexity Scaling Laws for Neural Models using Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12932v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.</p></details> | 45 pages, 20 figures |
| **[MTL-KD: Multi-Task Learning Via Knowledge Distillation for Generalizable Neural Vehicle Routing Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02935v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages,5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Lifting Theorems for One-Way Number-on-Forehead Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12420v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifting theorems are one of the most powerful tools for proving communication lower bounds, with numerous downstream applications in proof complexity, monotone circuit lower bounds, data structures, and combinatorial optimization. However, to the best of our knowledge, prior lifting theorems have primarily focused on the two-party communication. In this paper, we propose a new lifting theorem that establishes connections between two-party communication and the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) communication model. Specifically, we present a deterministic lifting theorem that translates one-way two-party communication lower bounds into one-way NOF lower bounds. Our lifting theorem yields two applications. First, we obtain an optimal explicit separation between randomized and deterministic one-way NOF communication, even in the multi-player setting. This improves the prior square-root vs. constant separation for three players established by Kelley and Lyu (arXiv 2025). Second, we achieve optimal separations between one-round and two-round deterministic NOF communication, improving upon the previous separation of $\Omega(\frac{n^{1/(k-1)}}{k^k})$ vs. $O(\log n)$ for $k$ players, as shown by Viola and Wigderson (FOCS 2007). Beyond the lifting theorems, we also apply our techniques to the disjointness problem. In particular, we provide a new proof that the deterministic one-way three-party NOF communication complexity of set disjointness is $\Omega(n)$, further demonstrating the broader applicability of our methods.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Knapsack and Shortest Path Problems Generalizations From A Quantum-Inspired Tensor Network Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11711v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present two tensor network quantum-inspired algorithms to solve the knapsack and the shortest path problems, and enables to solve some of its variations. These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, extended version of the presented and published at the 1st International Conference on Quantum Software (IQSOFT)</p></details> |
| **[QPanda3: A High-Performance Software-Hardware Collaborative Framework for Large-Scale Quantum-Classical Computing Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02455v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In emerging quantum-classical integration applications, the classical time cost-especially from compilation and protocol-level communication often exceeds the execution time of quantum circuits themselves, posing a severe bottleneck to practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, QPanda3 has been extensively optimized as a high-performance quantum programming framework tailored for the demands of the NISQ era and quantum-classical hybrid workflows. It features optimized circuit compilation, a custom binary instruction stream (OriginBIS), and hardware-aware execution strategies to significantly reduce latency and communication overhead. OriginBIS achieves up to 86.9$\times$ faster encoding and 35.6$\times$ faster decoding than OpenQASM 2.0, addressing critical bottlenecks in hybrid quantum systems. Benchmarks show 10.7$\times$ compilation speedup and up to 597$\times$ acceleration in compiling large-scale circuits (e.g., a 118-qubit W-state) compared to Qiskit. n high-performance simulation, QPanda3 excels in variational quantum algorithms, achieving up to 26$\times$ faster gradient computation than Qiskit, with minimal time-complexity growth across circuit depths. These capabilities make QPanda3 well-suited for scalable quantum algorithm development in finance, materials science, and combinatorial optimization, while supporting industrial deployment and cloud-based execution in quantum-classical hybrid computing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06458v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |
| **[GraphThought: Graph Combinatorial Optimization with Thought Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11607v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph combinatorial optimization (GCO) problems are central to domains like logistics and bioinformatics. While traditional solvers dominate, large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for structured reasoning, yet struggle with complex GCO tasks requiring rigorous combinatorial analysis and multi-step deduction, often producing hallucinated steps. We first formalize the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem, which provides a structured guidance for producing high-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Building on this formulation, we introduce GraphThought, a novel framework that generates effective reasoning sequences through either heuristic-guided forward search or solver-aligned backward reasoning. By fine-tuning LLMs on these structured thought sequences, we develop Llama-GT, an 8B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraphArena benchmark, outperforming significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3. Our results demonstrate that when scaffolded with structured reasoning priors, principled thought generation can significantly enhance LLM performance on GCO tasks without requiring increased model scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[GPU-Accelerated Distributed QAOA on Large-scale HPC Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10531v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing holds great potential to accelerate the process of solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. The Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DQAOA) addresses high-dimensional, dense problems using current quantum computing techniques and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. In this work, we improve the scalability and efficiency of DQAOA through advanced problem decomposition and parallel execution using message passing on the Frontier CPU/GPU supercomputer. Our approach ensures efficient quantum-classical workload management by distributing large problem instances across classical and quantum resources. Experimental results demonstrate that enhanced decomposition strategies and GPU-accelerated quantum simulations significantly improve DQAOA's performance, achieving up to 10x speedup over CPU-based simulations. This advancement enables better scalability for large problem instances, supporting the practical deployment of GPU systems for hybrid quantum-classical applications. We also highlight ongoing integration efforts using the Quantum Framework (QFw) to support future HPC-quantum computing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Min-Max Control Barrier Functions For Switched Affine Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10296v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of synthesizing non-smooth control barrier functions (CBFs) for continuous-time switched affine systems. Switched affine systems are defined by a set of affine dynamical modes, wherein the control consists of a state-based switching signal that determines the current operating mode. The control barrier functions seek to maintain the system state inside a control invariant set that excludes a given set of unsafe states. We consider CBFs that take the form of pointwise minima and maxima over a finite set of affine functions. Our approach uses ideas from nonsmooth analysis to formulate conditions for min- and max- affine control barrier functions. We show how a feedback switching law can be extracted from a given CBF. Next, we show how to automate the process of synthesizing CBFs given a system description through a tree-search algorithm inspired by branch-and-cut methods from combinatorial optimization. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a series of interesting examples of switched affine systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14409v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lower bounds on the number of rounds of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm required for guaranteed approximation ratios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15442v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm, also known in its generalization as the quantum alternating operator ansatz, (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as maximum satisfiability. While the QAOA is well studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes) required for the QAOA. For our main result, we (i) leverage a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of the QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds of the QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii) show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective functions, and when the problem can be modeled as a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the conventional transverse-field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded-occurrence local cost problems and for all strictly $k$-local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with a constant-round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. Using our proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound for unstructured search and, with small modification, show that our bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, comments welcome, close to the published version</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Design Structure Matrix Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposition Strategies and Multi-shot ASP Solving for Job-shop Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07537v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an extended version of our papers presented at the 38th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2022) and the 24th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2022), accepted for publication in Logical Methods in Computer Science journal</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Heuristics Generation for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12627v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies exploited Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate heuristics for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), by prompting LLMs to first provide search directions and then derive heuristics accordingly. However, the absence of task-specific knowledge in prompts often leads LLMs to provide unspecific search directions, obstructing the derivation of well-performing heuristics. Moreover, evaluating the derived heuristics remains resource-intensive, especially for those semantically equivalent ones, often requiring omissible resource expenditure. To enable LLMs to provide specific search directions, we propose the Hercules algorithm, which leverages our designed Core Abstraction Prompting (CAP) method to abstract the core components from elite heuristics and incorporate them as prior knowledge in prompts. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of CAP in reducing unspecificity and provide empirical results in this work. To reduce computing resources required for evaluating the derived heuristics, we propose few-shot Performance Prediction Prompting (PPP), a first-of-its-kind method for the Heuristic Generation (HG) task. PPP leverages LLMs to predict the fitness values of newly derived heuristics by analyzing their semantic similarity to previously evaluated ones. We further develop two tailored mechanisms for PPP to enhance predictive accuracy and determine unreliable predictions, respectively. The use of PPP makes Hercules more resource-efficient and we name this variant Hercules-P. Extensive experiments across four HG tasks, five COPs, and eight LLMs demonstrate that Hercules outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based HG algorithms, while Hercules-P excels at minimizing required computing resources. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of CAP, PPP, and the other proposed mechanisms by conducting relevant ablation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Synergizing Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms for Neural Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09404v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging due to their discrete structure and exponentially large solution space. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Distortion Clustering in Bounded Growth Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05132v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The well-known clustering algorithm of Miller, Peng, and Xu (SPAA 2013) is useful for many applications, including low-diameter decomposition and low-energy distributed algorithms. One nice property of their clustering, shown in previous work by Chang, Dani, Hayes, and Pettie (PODC 2020), is that distances in the cluster graph are rescaled versions of distances in the original graph, up to an $O(\log n)$ distortion factor and rounding issues. Minimizing this distortion factor is important for efficiency in computing the clustering, as well as in further applications, once the clustering has been constructed. We prove that there exist graphs for which an $\Omega((\log n)^{1/3})$ distortion factor is necessary for any clustering. We also consider a class of nice graphs which we call uniformly bounded independence graphs. These include, for example, paths, lattice graphs, and "dense" unit disk graphs. For these graphs, we prove that clusterings of constant distortion always exist, and moreover, we give an efficient distributed algorithm to construct them. Our clustering algorithm is based on Voronoi cells centered at the vertices of a maximal independent set in a suitable power graph. Applications of our new clustering include low-energy simulation of distributed algorithms in the LOCAL, CONGEST, and RADIO-CONGEST models, as well as efficient approximate solutions to distributed combinatorial optimization problems. We complement these results with matching or nearly matching lower bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced Kernel Search approach for the MST Problem with conflicts involving affinity detection and initial solution construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02222v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem with Conflicts consists in finding the minimum conflict-free spanning tree of a graph, i.e., the spanning tree of minimum cost, including no pairs of edges that are in conflict. In this paper, we solve this problem using an enhanced Kernel Search method, which iteratively solves refined problem restrictions. Our approach addresses two central open questions in the kernel search literature: (1) how to determine the affinity between variables to ensure that the restricted problem contains variables that are as compatible as possible, meaning they are more likely to appear together in a feasible solution, and (2) how to construct an initial feasible solution quickly. To this end, we integrate the computation of independent sets from the conflict graph within the algorithm to detect affinities and effectively manage conflicts. Furthermore, we heuristically construct an initial starting point, significantly accelerating the computational process. Although our methodology is designed for MSTC, its principles could be extended to other combinatorial optimization problems with conflicts. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate the efficiency and competitiveness of our approach compared to existing methods in the literature, achieving 17 new best-known values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference-Driven Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization with Conditional Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08898v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values. Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority and strong generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |

Despite the growing need for automated equivalence checks -- driven, for example, by optimization copilots, which generate problem formulations from natural language descriptions -- current approaches rely on simple heuristics that fail to reliably check formulation equivalence. Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work we introduce Quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings for scalable, reliable equivalence checking, with a verification stage that ensures mapped solutions preserve feasibility and optimality without additional solver calls. To evaluate our approach, we construct EquivaFormulation, the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations. Empirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Graph Neural Networks: A Customizable Reinforcement Learning Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13781v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The job shop scheduling problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem relevant to manufacturing and timetabling. Traditional approaches use priority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has attempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training such models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node features, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for experimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces JobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and creating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained several dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's utility. One model outperformed various graph-based dispatchers using only individual operation features, highlighting the importance of feature customization. Our GNN model achieved near state-of-the-art results on large-scale problems. These results suggest significant room for improvement in developing such models. JobShopLib provides the necessary tools for future experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bache...</summary><p>Bachelor's thesis, Universidad Polit\'ecnica de Madrid, 2025. 150 pages, 23 figures</p></details> |
| **[Regularized Langevin Dynamics for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00277v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a simple yet effective sampling framework for combinatorial optimization (CO). Our method builds on discrete Langevin dynamics (LD), an efficient gradient-guided generative paradigm. However, we observe that directly applying LD often leads to limited exploration. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Regularized Langevin Dynamics (RLD), which enforces an expected distance between the sampled and current solutions, effectively avoiding local minima. We develop two CO solvers on top of RLD, one based on simulated annealing (SA), and the other one based on neural network (NN). Empirical results on three classic CO problems demonstrate that both of our methods can achieve comparable or better performance against the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) SA- and NN-based solvers. In particular, our SA algorithm reduces the runtime of the previous SOTA SA method by up to 80\%, while achieving equal or superior performance. In summary, RLD offers a promising framework for enhancing both traditional heuristics and NN models to solve CO problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shengyu-Feng/RLD4CO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Systematic and Efficient Construction of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Forms for High-order and Dense Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08448v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA, quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs. However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning (ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Switching on the Pareto Front: Multi-Objective Deep Kernel Learning in Automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08073v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning, but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex, non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology, exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning. To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[DISCO: Efficient Diffusion Solver for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19705v7)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems are fundamentally important in numerous real-world applications across diverse industries, characterized by entailing enormous solution space and demanding time-sensitive response. Despite recent advancements in neural solvers, their limited expressiveness struggles to capture the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has shifted towards diffusion models, these models still sample solutions indiscriminately from the entire NP-complete solution space with time-consuming denoising processes, which limit their practicality for large problem scales. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for large-scale Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is twofold: First, it enhances solution quality by constraining the sampling space to a more meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while preserving the multi-modal properties of the output distributions. Second, it accelerates the denoising process through an analytically solvable approach, enabling solution sampling with minimal reverse-time steps and significantly reducing inference time. DISCO delivers strong performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with inference time up to 5.28 times faster than other diffusion alternatives. By incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can well generalize to solve unseen-scale problem instances, even surpassing models specifically trained for those scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyColor: An Efficient Heuristic Algorithm for Graph Coloring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07373v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark, totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore, HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal coloring in 128 instances.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06648v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diversity plays a significant role in many problems, such as ensemble learning, reinforcement learning, and combinatorial optimization. How to define the diversity measure is a longstanding problem. Many methods rely on expert experience to define a proper behavior space and then obtain the diversity measure, which is, however, challenging in many scenarios. In this paper, we propose the problem of learning a behavior space from human feedback and present a general method called Diversity from Human Feedback (DivHF) to solve it. DivHF learns a behavior descriptor consistent with human preference by querying human feedback. The learned behavior descriptor can be combined with any distance measure to define a diversity measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DivHF by integrating it with the Quality-Diversity optimization algorithm MAP-Elites and conducting experiments on the QDax suite. The results show that the behavior learned by DivHF is much more consistent with human requirements than the one learned by direct data-driven approaches without human feedback, and makes the final solutions more diverse under human preference. Our contributions include formulating the problem, proposing the DivHF method, and demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[GELD: A Unified Neural Model for Efficiently Solving Traveling Salesman Problems Across Different Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06634v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless, these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process. Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to 744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 4 figures, and 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[Differentiable Quadratic Optimization For The Maximum Independent Set Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19532v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions with respect to the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To tackle the non-convexity of the objective, we propose optimizing several initializations in parallel using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. We dub our method as parallelized Clique-Informed Quadratic Optimization for MIS (pCQO-MIS). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges. Our code is available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ledenmat/pCQO-mis-benchmark/tree/refactor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blackout DIFUSCO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05221v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the integration of Blackout Diffusion into the DIFUSCO framework for combinatorial optimization, specifically targeting the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Inspired by the success of discrete-time diffusion models (D3PM) in maintaining structural integrity, we extend the paradigm to a continuous-time framework, leveraging the unique properties of Blackout Diffusion. Continuous-time modeling introduces smoother transitions and refined control, hypothesizing enhanced solution quality over traditional discrete methods. We propose three key improvements to enhance the diffusion process. First, we transition from a discrete-time-based model to a continuous-time framework, providing a more refined and flexible formulation. Second, we refine the observation time scheduling to ensure a smooth and linear transformation throughout the diffusion process, allowing for a more natural progression of states. Finally, building upon the second improvement, we further enhance the reverse process by introducing finer time slices in regions that are particularly challenging for the model, thereby improving accuracy and stability in the reconstruction phase. Although the experimental results did not exceed the baseline performance, they demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in balancing simplicity and complexity, offering new insights into diffusion-based combinatorial optimization. This work represents the first application of Blackout Diffusion to combinatorial optimization, providing a foundation for further advancements in this domain. * The code is available for review at https://github.com/Giventicket/BlackoutDIFUSCO.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$ in dense networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by JSAC 2025</p></details> |

In particular, understanding the performance of multi-agent discrete-choice combinatorial optimization under distributed adversary attacks is a compelling and underexplored problem, since multi-agent systems exhibit a large number of remote control variables that can influence in an unprecedented way the cost-effectiveness of distributed optimization heuristics. This paper unravels for the first time the trajectories of distributed optimization from resilience to vulnerability, and finally to collapse under varying adversary influence. Using real-world data to emulate over 28 billion multi-agent optimization scenarios, we exhaustively assess how the number of agents with different adversarial severity and network positioning influences optimization performance, including the influence on Pareto optimal points. With this novel large-scale dataset, made openly available as a benchmark, we disentangle how optimization remains resilient to adversaries and which adversary conditions are required to make optimization vulnerable or collapsed. These new findings can provide new insights for designing self-healing strategies for fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization that have been missing so far.</p></details> |  |
| **[When is local search both effective and efficient?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02634v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many combinatorial optimization problems can be represented by valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) and the fitness landscapes that they generate. Local search starts at an assignment in this landscape and successively moves assignments until no further improvement is possible among the adjacent assignments. Classic analyses of local search algorithms have focused mostly on the question of effectiveness ("did we find a good solution?") and often implicitly assumed that there are no doubts about their efficiency ("did we find it quickly?"). But there are many reasons to doubt the efficiency of local search. Even if we focus on fitness landscapes on the hypercube that are single peaked on every subcube (known as semismooth fitness landscapes, completely unimodal pseudo-Boolean functions, or acyclic unique sink orientations) where effectiveness is obvious, many local search algorithms are known to be inefficient. We define a "direction" for valued constraints such that directed VCSPs generate semismooth fitness landscapes. We call directed VCSPs oriented if they do not have any pair of variables with arcs in both directions. Since recognizing if a VCSP-instance is directed or oriented is coNP-complete, we generalized oriented VCSPs as conditionally-smooth fitness landscapes where the structural property of 'conditionally-smooth' is recognizable in polynomial time. We prove that many popular local search algorithms like random ascent, simulated annealing, history-based rules, jumping rules, and the Kernighan-Lin heuristic are very efficient on conditionally-smooth landscapes. But conditionally-smooth landscapes are still expressive enough so that other well-regarded local search algorithms like steepest ascent and random facet require a super-polynomial number of steps to find the fitness peak.</p></details> | 29 pgs |

Recent Neural Combinatorial Optimization methods leverage deep learning to learn solution strategies, trained via Supervised or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While promising, these approaches often rely on task-specific augmentations, perform poorly on out-of-distribution instances, and lack robust inference mechanisms. Moreover, existing latent space models either require labeled data or rely on pre-trained policies. In this work, we propose LGS-Net, a novel latent space model that conditions on problem instances, and introduce an efficient inference method, Latent Guided Sampling (LGS), based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Stochastic Approximation. We show that the iterations of our method form a time-inhomogeneous Markov Chain and provide rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees. Empirical results on benchmark routing tasks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among RL-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges.

In this work, we introduce EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators), a novel framework that automates the co-evolution of optimization problem instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers using large language models (LLMs). EALG leverages a mutation-based adversarial approach that dynamically evolves instance generation procedures to create increasingly difficult problems, while simultaneously synthesizing adaptive heuristic algorithms through interactions with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on static benchmark creation or manual solver design, EALG provides a seamless pipeline from instance generation to solver synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EALG generates significantly harder instances than current benchmarks, and its synthesized solvers generalize effectively across a broad spectrum of combinatorial tasks. This work explores a new paradigm for combinatorial optimization that integrates instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Secure Transmissions in IRS-Assisted NOMA Communications: CO-GNN Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05381v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) enhance spectral efficiency by adjusting reflection phase shifts, while Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) increases system capacity. Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS, lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network (CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the system.</p></details> |  |

Designing high-quality heuristic algorithms that efficiently approximate optimal solutions within reasonable time is a critical research challenge. In recent years, many works have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms to automate heuristic algorithm design through prompt engineering. However, these approaches generally adopt a problem-specific paradigm, applying a single algorithm across all problem instances, failing to account for the heterogeneity across instances. In this paper, we propose InstSpecHH, a novel framework that introduces the concept of instance-specific heuristic generation. InstSpecHH partitions the overall problem class into sub-classes based on instance features and performs differentiated, automated heuristic design for each problem subclass. By tailoring heuristics to the unique features of different sub-classes, InstSpecHH achieves better performance at the problem class level while avoiding redundant heuristic generation for similar instances, thus reducing computational overhead. This approach effectively balances the trade-off between the cost of automatic heuristic design and the quality of the obtained solutions. To evaluate the performance of InstSpecHH, we conduct experiments on 4,500 subclasses of the Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) and 365 subclasses of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that InstSpecHH demonstrates strong intra-subclass and inter-subclass generalization capabilities. Compared to previous problem-specific methods, InstSpecHH reduces the average optimality gap by more than 5.6\% for OBPP and 0.9\% for CVRP. These results highlight the potential of instance-aware automatic heuristic design to further enhance solution quality.</p></details> |  |

While existing NCO methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data, rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.24627</p></details> |

However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Best-anchored and Objective-guided Preference Optimization (BOPO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) a best-anchored preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) an objective-guided pairwise loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) show BOPO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. BOPO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Primal heuristics play a crucial role in quickly finding feasible solutions for NP-hard ILP. Although $\textit{end-to-end learning}$-based primal heuristics (E2EPH) have recently been proposed, they are typically unable to independently generate feasible solutions and mainly focus on binary variables. Ensuring feasibility is critical, especially when handling non-binary integer variables. To address this challenge, we propose RL-SPH, a novel reinforcement learning-based start primal heuristic capable of independently generating feasible solutions, even for ILP involving non-binary integers. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-SPH rapidly obtains high-quality feasible solutions, achieving on average a 44x lower primal gap and a 2.3x lower primal integral compared to existing primal heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (19 pages, 7 figures).

While state-of-the-art solvers have demonstrated high efficiency in handling conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas, numerous applications require non-CNF (hybrid) constraints, such as XOR, cardinality, and Not-All-Equal constraints. Recent work leverages polynomial representations to represent such hybrid constraints, but it relies on box constraints that can limit the use of powerful unconstrained optimizers. In this paper, we propose unconstrained continuous optimization formulations for hybrid SAT solving by penalty terms. We provide theoretical insights into when these penalty terms are necessary and demonstrate empirically that unconstrained optimizers (e.g., Adam) can enhance SAT solving on hybrid benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of combining continuous optimization and machine-learning-based methods for effective hybrid SAT solving.</p></details> |  |

Checking this non-robustness directly poses a combinatorial optimization problem and is intractable even for simple models and moderate data sizes. Recently various authors have proposed a diverse set of approximations to detect this non-robustness. In the present work, we show that, even in a setting as simple as ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, many of these approximations can fail to detect (true) non-robustness in realistic data arrangements. We focus on OLS in the present work due its widespread use and since some approximations work only for OLS. Across our synthetic and real-world data sets, we find that a simple recursive greedy algorithm is the sole algorithm that does not fail any of our tests and also that it can be orders of magnitude faster to run than some competitors.</p></details> | 71 pages |
| **[Learning Distributions over Permutations and Rankings with Factorized Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24664v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning distributions over permutations is a fundamental problem in machine learning, with applications in ranking, combinatorial optimization, structured prediction, and data association. Existing methods rely on mixtures of parametric families or neural networks with expensive variational inference procedures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages alternative representations for permutations, including Lehmer codes, Fisher-Yates draws, and Insertion-Vectors. These representations form a bijection with the symmetric group, allowing for unconstrained learning using conventional deep learning techniques, and can represent any probability distribution over permutations. Our approach enables a trade-off between expressivity of the model family and computational requirements. In the least expressive and most computationally efficient case, our method subsumes previous families of well established probabilistic models over permutations, including Mallow's and the Repeated Insertion Model. Experiments indicate our method significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle benchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this benchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability distributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct solution exists). We therefore propose two additional benchmarks: learning cyclic permutations and re-ranking movies based on user preference. We show that our method learns non-trivial distributions even in the least expressive mode, while traditional models fail to even generate valid permutations in this setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problems with Different Constraint Tightness Degrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24627v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various constraint tightness degrees.</p></details> |  |

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown significant benefits in solving CO problems, reducing reliance on domain expertise and improving computational efficiency. However, the absence of a unified benchmarking framework leads to inconsistent evaluations, limits reproducibility, and increases engineering overhead, raising barriers to adoption for new researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce RL4CO, a unified and extensive benchmark with in-depth library coverage of 27 CO problem environments and 23 state-of-the-art baselines. Built on efficient software libraries and best practices in implementation, RL4CO features modularized implementation and flexible configurations of diverse environments, policy architectures, RL algorithms, and utilities with extensive documentation. RL4CO helps researchers build on existing successes while exploring and developing their own designs, facilitating the entire research process by decoupling science from heavy engineering.

Given an error parameter $\epsilon>0$, such algorithmic schemes attain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation in $t(\epsilon)\cdot poly(|{\cal I}|)$ time, where $t(\cdot)$ is a function that depends only on $\epsilon$ and $|{\cal I}|$ denotes the input length. Technically speaking, our approach relies on presenting tailor-made reductions to a newly-introduced multi-dimensional Santa Claus problem. Even though the single-dimensional version of this problem is already known to be APX-Hard, we prove that an EPTAS can be designed for a constant number of machines and dimensions, which hold for each of our applications. To demonstrate the versatility of our framework, we first study selection-stopping settings to derive an EPTAS for the Free-Order Prophets problem [Agrawal et al., EC~'20] and for its cost-driven generalization, Pandora's Box with Commitment [Fu et al., ICALP~'18]. These results constitute the first approximation schemes in the non-adaptive setting and improve on known \emph{inefficient} polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for their adaptive variants. Next, turning our attention to stochastic probing problems, we obtain an EPTAS for the adaptive ProbeMax problem as well as for its non-adaptive counterpart; in both cases, state-of-the-art approximability results have been inefficient PTASes [Chen et al., NIPS~'16; Fu et al., ICALP~'18].</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages; the preliminary version appeared in EC 2021</p></details> |

Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness, interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1) Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2) Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning, which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language models within intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for generating a traffic simulation from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we demonstrate that our pipeline can accurately capture the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation.

Yet, existing unsupervised neural network solvers struggle to solve $k$-grouping problems (e.g., coloring, partitioning) on large-scale graphs and hypergraphs, due to limited computational frameworks. In this work, we propose Deep $k$-grouping, an unsupervised learning-based CO framework. Specifically, we contribute: Novel one-hot encoded polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (OH-PUBO), a formulation for modeling k-grouping problems on graphs and hypergraphs (e.g., graph/hypergraph coloring and partitioning); GPU-accelerated algorithms for large-scale k-grouping CO problems. Deep $k$-grouping employs the relaxation of large-scale OH-PUBO objectives as differentiable loss functions and trains to optimize them in an unsupervised manner. To ensure scalability, it leverages GPU-accelerated algorithms to unify the training pipeline; A Gini coefficient-based continuous relaxation annealing strategy to enforce discreteness of solutions while preventing convergence to local optima. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep $k$-grouping outperforms existing neural network solvers and classical heuristics such as SCIP and Tabu.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Heuristic Generation Through Large Language Models with Meta-Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20881v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristic design with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for tackling combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, existing approaches often rely on manually predefined evolutionary computation (EC) optimizers and single-task training schemes, which may constrain the exploration of diverse heuristic algorithms and hinder the generalization of the resulting heuristics. To address these issues, we propose Meta-Optimization of Heuristics (MoH), a novel framework that operates at the optimizer level, discovering effective optimizers through the principle of meta-learning. Specifically, MoH leverages LLMs to iteratively refine a meta-optimizer that autonomously constructs diverse optimizers through (self-)invocation, thereby eliminating the reliance on a predefined EC optimizer. These constructed optimizers subsequently evolve heuristics for downstream tasks, enabling broader heuristic exploration. Moreover, MoH employs a multi-task training scheme to promote its generalization capability. Experiments on classic COPs demonstrate that MoH constructs an effective and interpretable meta-optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, particularly in cross-size settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Optimization Accelerator Framework for Multistate Ising Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20250v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising Machines are a prominent class of hardware architectures that aim to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These machines consist of a network of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the optimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to harness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this transformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more complex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely impacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin interactions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce the exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class of multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology achieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine learning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing Ising methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering with our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50% compared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a 1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up to 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the number of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising machines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all metrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution quality. Thus, this work expands the potential of existing Ising hardware to solve a broad class of these multistate optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 page main text, 4 main figures, 1 main table, 1 page supplementary, 2 supplementary figures,</p></details> |

The main challenges from these approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and implementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP and CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still require considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic design methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.</p></details> | Under Review |

While exact solutions are often computationally infeasible, many practical applications require high-quality solutions within a given time budget. To address this, we propose a learning-based approach that enhances existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. Specifically, we parameterize these approximation algorithms and train graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict parameter values that yield near-optimal solutions. Our method is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion, using a novel gradient estimation scheme that treats the approximation algorithm as a black box. This approach combines the strengths of learning and traditional algorithms: the GNN learns from data to guide the algorithm toward better solutions, while the approximation algorithm ensures feasibility. We validate our method on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and the minimum k-cut problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art learned CO solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, under review</p></details> |

This abstraction captures and generalizes classical models in economics and combinatorial optimization, including submodular utility allocation (SUA) markets and combinatorial contracts. At the core of our framework is the notion of density decomposition, which extends classical results to the dual-modular setting and uncovers structural insights into fairness and optimality. We show that the density decomposition yields a canonical vector of reward-to-cost ratios (densities) that simultaneously characterizes market equilibria, fair allocations -- via both lexicographic optimality and local maximin conditions -- and best-response strategies in contract design. Our main result proves the equivalence of these fairness notions and guarantees the existence of allocations that realize the decomposition densities. Our technical contributions include the analysis of a broad family of convex programs -- parameterized by divergences such as quadratic, logarithmic, and hockey-stick functions -- whose minimizers recover the density decomposition. We prove that any strictly convex divergence yields the same canonical density vector, and that locally maximin allocations act as universal minimizers for all divergences satisfying the data processing inequality. As an application of our framework, we determine the structure and number of critical values in the combinatorial contracts problem. Additionally, we generalize a Frank-Wolfe-type iterative method for approximating the dual-modular density decomposition, establishing both convergence guarantees and practical potential through efficient gradient oracle design.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce a demand selection problem for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with an emission quota, referred to as QVRP. The objective is to minimize the number of omitted deliveries while respecting the pollution quota. We focus on the demand selection part, called Maximum Feasible Vehicle Assignment (MFVA), while the construction of a routing for the VRP instance is solved using classical OR methods. We propose several methods for selecting the packages to omit, both from machine learning (ML) and OR. Our results show that, in this static problem setting, classical OR-based methods consistently outperform ML-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

We introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Naive application of conventional multi-task learning approaches often falls short in delivering a high-quality, unified neural solver. This deficiency primarily stems from the significant computational demands and a lack of adequate consideration for the complexities inherent in COPs. In this paper, we propose a general and efficient training paradigm to deliver a unified combinatorial multi-task neural solver. To this end, we resort to the theoretical loss decomposition for multiple tasks under an encoder-decoder framework, which enables more efficient training via proper bandit task-sampling algorithms through an intra-task influence matrix. By employing theoretically grounded approximations, our method significantly enhances overall performance, regardless of whether it is within constrained training budgets, across equivalent training epochs, or in terms of generalization capabilities, when compared to conventional training schedules. On the real-world datasets of TSPLib and CVRPLib, our method also achieved the best results compared to single task learning and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, the influence matrix provides empirical evidence supporting common practices in the field of learning to optimize, further substantiating the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[Neural Solver Selection for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09693v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has increasingly been employed to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, resulting in the emergence of neural solvers that demonstrate remarkable performance, even with minimal domain-specific knowledge. To date, the community has created numerous open-source neural solvers with distinct motivations and inductive biases. While considerable efforts are devoted to designing powerful single solvers, our findings reveal that existing solvers typically demonstrate complementary performance across different problem instances. This suggests that significant improvements could be achieved through effective coordination of neural solvers at the instance level. In this work, we propose the first general framework to coordinate the neural solvers, which involves feature extraction, selection model, and selection strategy, aiming to allocate each instance to the most suitable solvers. To instantiate, we collect several typical neural solvers with state-of-the-art performance as alternatives, and explore various methods for each component of the framework. We evaluated our framework on two extensively studied combinatorial optimization problems, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively distribute instances and the resulting composite solver can achieve significantly better performance (e.g., reduce the optimality gap by 0.88\% on TSPLIB and 0.71\% on CVRPLIB) than the best individual neural solver with little extra time cost.</p></details> |  |

Due to its factorial complexity, solving large-scale instances requires scalable and efficient algorithmic frameworks, often enabled by parallel computing. This literature review provides a comparative evaluation of parallel TSP optimization methods, including exact algorithms, heuristic-based approaches, hybrid metaheuristics, and machine learning-enhanced models. In addition, we introduce task-specific evaluation metrics to facilitate cross-paradigm analysis, particularly for hybrid and adaptive solvers. The review concludes by identifying research gaps and outlining future directions, including deep learning integration, exploring quantum-inspired algorithms, and establishing reproducible evaluation frameworks to support scalable and adaptive TSP optimization in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMask: Learn to Solve Constrained Routing Problems with Lazy Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17938v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Routing problems are canonical combinatorial optimization tasks with wide-ranging applications in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management. However, solving these problems becomes significantly more challenging when complex constraints are involved. In this paper, we propose LMask, a novel learning framework that utilizes dynamic masking to generate high-quality feasible solutions for constrained routing problems. LMask introduces the LazyMask decoding method, which lazily refines feasibility masks with the backtracking mechanism. In addition, it employs the refinement intensity embedding to encode the search trace into the model, mitigating representation ambiguities induced by backtracking. To further reduce sampling cost, LMask sets a backtracking budget during decoding, while constraint violations are penalized in the loss function during training to counteract infeasibility caused by this budget. We provide theoretical guarantees for the validity and probabilistic optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments on the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and TSP with draft limits (TSPDL) demonstrate that LMask achieves state-of-the-art feasibility rates and solution quality, outperforming existing neural methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalized Cut with Reinforcement Learning in Constrained Action Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13986v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an important paradigm to solve combinatorial optimization problems primarily due to its ability to learn heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating external knowledge that will steer combinatorial optimization problem solutions towards domain appropriate outcomes remains an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we propose the first RL solution that uses constrained action spaces to guide the normalized cut problem towards pre-defined template instances. Using transportation networks as an example domain, we create a Wedge and Ring Transformer that results in graph partitions that are shaped in form of Wedges and Rings and which are likely to be closer to natural optimal partitions. However, our approach is general as it is based on principles that can be generalized to other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards VM Rescheduling Optimization Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17359v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern industry-scale data centers need to manage a large number of virtual machines (VMs). Due to the continual creation and release of VMs, many small resource fragments are scattered across physical machines (PMs). To handle these fragments, data centers periodically reschedule some VMs to alternative PMs, a practice commonly referred to as VM rescheduling. Despite the increasing importance of VM rescheduling as data centers grow in size, the problem remains understudied. We first show that, unlike most combinatorial optimization tasks, the inference time of VM rescheduling algorithms significantly influences their performance, due to dynamic VM state changes during this period. This causes existing methods to scale poorly. Therefore, we develop a reinforcement learning system for VM rescheduling, VM2RL, which incorporates a set of customized techniques, such as a two-stage framework that accommodates diverse constraints and workload conditions, a feature extraction module that captures relational information specific to rescheduling, as well as a risk-seeking evaluation enabling users to optimize the trade-off between latency and accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments with data from an industry-scale data center. Our results show that VM2RL can achieve a performance comparable to the optimal solution but with a running time of seconds.

| **[Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from softmax.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Contemporary ML-Based Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16952v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting model design and optimization for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale, synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial optimization.

| **[STRCMP: Integrating Graph Structural Priors with Language Models for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11057v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we systematically investigate the reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints, coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules. We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an 8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4. Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum of combinatorial optimization problems.

Motivated by the need for accurate and reliable epidemic forecasts to inform timely public health interventions, we develop a flexible model averaging (MA) framework using Sequential Monte Carlo Squared. While generating estimates from each model individually, our approach dynamically assigns them weights based on their incrementally estimated marginal likelihoods, accounting for both model and parameter uncertainty to produce a single ensemble estimate. We assess the methodology through simulation studies mimicking abrupt changes in epidemic dynamics, followed by an application to the Irish influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. Our results show that combining the two models can improve both estimates of the infection trajectory and reproduction number compared to using either model alone. Moreover, the MA consistently produces more stable and informative estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, with credible intervals that maintain appropriate coverage. These features are particularly valuable in high-uncertainty contexts where reliable situational awareness is essential. This research contributes to pandemic preparedness by enhancing forecast reliability and supporting more informed public health responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-dependent density estimation using binary classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15505v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of Classical Regression Methods for Optimal Switching Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15436v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simple regression methods provide robust, near-optimal solutions for optimal switching problems in dimensions ranging from 1 to 50. While the theory requires solving intractable PDE systems, the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm with classical approaches like $k$-NN achieves excellent switching decisions without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Testing eight regression approaches on four benchmark problems, we find that simple methods maintain stable performance across diverse problem characteristics, even after extensive neural network optimization. The contaminated training targets inherent to backward induction-where each target contains both approximation bias and Monte Carlo noise-actually favor these robust approaches over more complex alternatives such as neural networks. Further, we establish concentration bounds for $k$-NN regression under jump-diffusion dynamics and show that PCA enables $k$-NN to scale to high dimensions. For practitioners: simple, minimally-tuned regression methods offer reliable performance for computationally demanding switching problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic guessing for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with embedded numerical root-finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15423v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern implementations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and related MCMC algorithms support sampling of probability functions that embed numerical root-finding algorithms, thereby allowing fitting of statistical models involving analytically intractable algebraic constraints. However the application of these models in practice is limited by the computational cost of computing large numbers of numerical solutions. We identify a key limitation of previous approaches to HMC with embedded root-finding, which require the starting guess to be the same at all points on the same simulated Hamiltonian trajectory. We demonstrate that this requirement can be relaxed, so that the starting guess depends on the previous integrator state. To choose a good guess using this information we propose two heuristics: use the previous solution and extrapolate the previous solution using implicit differentiation. Both heuristics yield substantial performance improvements on a range of representative models compared with static guessing. We also present grapevine, a JAX-based Python package providing easy access to an implementation of the No-U-Turn sampler augmented with dynamic guessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

The analysis is based on a probabilistic approach assuming that the underlying asset price follows the Schwartz one-factor model, where the volatility of log-returns is time-varying. A difficult challenge in this pricing problem is to solve an analytical formula under the assumption of time-varying log-return volatility, resulting in the realized variance being distributed according to a linear combination of independent noncentral chi-square random variables with weighted parameters. By utilizing the probability density function, we analytically compute the expectation of the square root of the realized variance and derive pricing formulas for volatility swaps. Additionally, we derive analytical pricing formulas for volatility call options. For the payoff function without the square root, we also derive corresponding formulas for variance swaps and variance call options. Additionally, we study the case of constant log-return volatility; simplified pricing formulas are derived and sensitivity with respect to volatility (vega) is analytically studied. Furthermore,we propose simple closed-form approximations for pricing volatility swaps under the Schwartz one-factor model. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods are demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations, and the impact of price volatility and the number of trading days on fair strike prices of volatility and variance swaps is investigated across various numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema with Application to Risk-Sensitive Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01358v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve the statistical characterization of peak demand. Due to the stationarity assumption of classical extreme value analysis (EVA), existing approaches in the industry apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monte-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monte-Carlo experiments become intractable, and state-of-the-art generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)-based nonstationary EVA is often impractical due to convergence issues on high-dimensional covariates. This article explores uncharted territories and proposes a novel nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. Compared to GAMLSS, our method automatically discovers and robustly models complex relationships between the covariate and the peak demand density. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a 38% reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-based agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated, as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process. Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 6% absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

Continuous data collection through mobile devices generates highly complex data: entangled multivariate time series of outcomes, exposures, and covariates. Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex data structure of multivariate time series and their non-stationary nature make missing data a major challenge for proper inference. Additional historical information included in time series analyses exacerbates the issue of missing data and also introduces problems for confounding adjustment. The majority of existing imputation methods are either designed for stationary time series or for longitudinal data with limited follow-up periods. The limited work on non-stationary time series either focuses on missing exogenous information or ignores the complex temporal dependence among outcomes, exposures, and covariates. We propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for the state space model (MCEM-SSM) to effectively handle missing data in non-stationary entangled multivariate time series. We demonstrate the method's advantages over other widely used missing data imputation strategies through simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series, subject to various missing mechanisms. Finally, we apply the MCEM-SSM to a multi-year smartphone observational study of bipolar and schizophrenia patients to investigate the association between digital social connectivity and negative mood.</p></details> |  |
| **[Markov Regime-Switching Intelligent Driver Model for Interpretable Car-Following Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14762v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable car-following models are essential for traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle development. However, classical models like the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are fundamentally limited by their parsimonious and single-regime structure. They fail to capture the multi-modal nature of human driving, where a single driving state (e.g., speed, relative speed, and gap) can elicit many different driver actions. This forces the model to average across distinct behaviors, reducing its fidelity and making its parameters difficult to interpret. To overcome this, we introduce a regime-switching framework that allows driving behavior to be governed by different IDM parameter sets, each corresponding to an interpretable behavioral mode. This design enables the model to dynamically switch between interpretable behavioral modes, rather than averaging across diverse driving contexts. We instantiate the framework using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model with IDM dynamics (FHMM-IDM), which explicitly separates intrinsic driving regimes (e.g., aggressive acceleration, steady-state following) from external traffic scenarios (e.g., free-flow, congestion, stop-and-go) through two independent latent Markov processes. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to jointly estimate the regime-specific parameters, transition dynamics, and latent state trajectories. Experiments on the HighD dataset demonstrate that FHMM-IDM uncovers interpretable structure in human driving, effectively disentangling internal driver actions from contextual traffic conditions and revealing dynamic regime-switching patterns. This framework provides a tractable and principled solution to modeling context-dependent driving behavior under uncertainty, offering improvements in the fidelity of traffic simulations, the efficacy of safety analyses, and the development of more human-centric ADAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Trade-offs in Accuracy and Uncertainty Quantification: Architecture and Inference Choices in Bayesian Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11808v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern neural networks get more complex, specifying a model with high predictive performance and sound uncertainty quantification becomes a more challenging task. Despite some promising theoretical results on the true posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian neural networks, the properties of even the most commonly used posterior approximations are often questioned. Computational burdens and intractable posteriors expose miscalibrated Bayesian neural networks to poor accuracy and unreliable uncertainty estimates. Approximate Bayesian inference aims to replace unknown and intractable posterior distributions with some simpler but feasible distributions. The dimensions of modern deep models, coupled with the lack of identifiability, make Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tremendously expensive and unable to fully explore the multimodal posterior. On the other hand, variational inference benefits from improved computational complexity but lacks the asymptotical guarantees of sampling-based inference and tends to concentrate around a single mode. The performance of both approaches heavily depends on architectural choices; this paper aims to shed some light on this by considering the computational costs, accuracy and uncertainty quantification in different scenarios including large width and out-of-sample data. To improve posterior exploration, different model averaging and ensembling techniques are studied, along with their benefits on predictive performance. In our experiments, variational inference overall provided better uncertainty quantification than MCMC; further, stacking and ensembles of variational approximations provided comparable accuracy to MCMC at a much-reduced cost.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Yet, many modern chess engines rely on a single neural network to play the entire game uniformly, often missing opportunities to specialize. In this work, we introduce M2CTS, a modular framework that combines Mixture of Experts with Monte Carlo Tree Search to adapt strategy dynamically based on game phase. We explore three different methods for training the neural networks: Separated Learning, Staged Learning, and Weighted Learning. By routing decisions through specialized neural networks trained for each phase, M2CTS improves both computational efficiency and playing strength. In experiments on chess, M2CTS achieves up to +122 Elo over standard single-model baselines and shows promising generalization to multi-agent domains such as Pommerman. These results highlight how modular, phase-aware systems can better align with the structured nature of games and move us closer to human-like behavior in dividing a problem into many smaller units.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 33 figures, 15 tables.

We introduce a spatio-temporal inversion framework that embeds a deep-learning surrogate of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Bayesian inference of both emission rate and source location in dynamic flow fields. By substituting costly numerical solvers with a multilayer perceptron trained on high-fidelity CFD outputs, our surrogate captures spatial heterogeneity and temporal evolution of gas dispersion, while delivering near-real-time predictions. Validation on the Chilbolton methane release dataset demonstrates comparable accuracy to full CFD solvers and Gaussian plume models, yet achieves orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes. Further experiments under simulated obstructed-flow scenarios confirm robustness in complex environments. This work reconciles physical fidelity with computational feasibility, offering a scalable solution for industrial emissions monitoring and other time-sensitive spatio-temporal inversion tasks in environmental and scientific modeling.</p></details> | 3 figures, 11 pages |

To assess the impact of vaccination on rotavirus transmissibility we calibrated a stochastic compartmental epidemiological model using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. Our analysis focuses on estimating the time-varying transmissibility parameter and documenting its evolution before and after vaccine rollout. We observe distinct periods of increasing and decreasing transmissibility, reflecting the dynamic response of rotavirus spread to immunization efforts. These findings improve our understanding of vaccination-driven shifts in disease transmission and provide a quantitative framework for evaluating long-term epidemiological trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025 conference</p></details> |

We introduce a novel method enhancing knowledge distillation with integrated gradients (IG) as a data augmentation strategy. Our approach overlays IG maps onto input images during training, providing student models with deeper insights into teacher models' decision-making processes. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%). This compression reduces inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Our method precomputes IG maps before training, transforming substantial runtime costs into a one-time preprocessing step. Our comprehensive experiments include: (1) comparisons with attention transfer, revealing complementary benefits when combined with our approach; (2) Monte Carlo simulations confirming statistical robustness; (3) systematic evaluation of compression factor versus accuracy trade-offs across a wide range (2.2x-1122x); and (4) validation on an ImageNet subset aligned with CIFAR-10 classes, demonstrating generalisability beyond the initial dataset. These extensive ablation studies confirm that IG-based knowledge distillation consistently outperforms conventional approaches across varied architectures and compression ratios. Our results establish this framework as a viable compression technique for real-world deployment on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p></details> | 49 pages, 12 figures |

The obtained components provide a basis for various types of new tests in addition to the omnibus one. Component tests that based on each component serve as experts in detecting certain directions. Smooth tests that assemble a few components are also of great use in practice. To further improve testing performance, we introduce a component selection approach, aiming to identify the most contributory components. The finite sample performance of the proposed tests is illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments.</p></details> |  |

When rankings directly impact individuals, ensuring fairness becomes essential, particularly for groups that are marginalised or misrepresented in the data. Most of the existing group fairness frameworks often rely on ensuring proportional representation of protected groups. However, these approaches face limitations in accounting for the stochastic nature of ranking processes or the finite size of candidate pools. To this end, we present hyperFA*IR, a framework for assessing and enforcing fairness in rankings drawn from a finite set of candidates. It relies on a generative process based on the hypergeometric distribution, which models real-world scenarios by sampling without replacement from fixed group sizes. This approach improves fairness assessment when top-$k$ selections are large relative to the pool or when protected groups are small. We compare our approach to the widely used binomial model, which treats each draw as independent with fixed probability, and demonstrate$-$both analytically and empirically$-$that our method more accurately reproduces the statistical properties of sampling from a finite population. To operationalise this framework, we propose a Monte Carlo-based algorithm that efficiently detects unfair rankings by avoiding computationally expensive parameter tuning. Finally, we adapt our generative approach to define affirmative action policies by introducing weights into the sampling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT'25)</p></details> |
| **[QuantFactor REINFORCE: Mining Steady Formulaic Alpha Factors with Variance-bounded REINFORCE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05144v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alpha factor mining aims to discover investment signals from the historical financial market data, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient-yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Temperature-Annealed Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19077v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient sampling of unnormalized probability densities such as the Boltzmann distribution of molecular systems is a longstanding challenge. Next to conventional approaches like molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational approaches, such as training normalizing flows with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, have been introduced. However, such methods are prone to mode collapse and often do not learn to sample the full configurational space. Here, we present temperature-annealed Boltzmann generators (TA-BG) to address this challenge. First, we demonstrate that training a normalizing flow with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence at high temperatures is possible without mode collapse. Furthermore, we introduce a reweighting-based training objective to anneal the distribution to lower target temperatures. We apply this methodology to three molecular systems of increasing complexity and, compared to the baseline, achieve better results in almost all metrics while requiring up to three times fewer target energy evaluations. For the largest system, our approach is the only method that accurately resolves the metastable states of the system.</p></details> |  |

We present a generative model that is interpretable, easy to design, and efficient. Our approach couples a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network generator with independent energy-based priors, trained via Maximum Likelihood. Inverse sampling enables fast inference, while prior knowledge can be incorporated before training to better align priors with posteriors, thereby improving learning efficiency and sample quality. The learned prior is also recoverable and visualizable post-training, offering an empirical Bayes perspective. To address inflexibility and mitigate prior-posterior mismatch, we introduce scalable extensions based on mixture distributions and Langevin Monte Carlo methods, admitting a trade-off between flexibility and training efficiency. Our contributions connect classical representation theorems with modern probabilistic modeling, while balancing training stability, inference speed, and the quality and diversity of generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11422v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristics have achieved great success in solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Given the fact that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content, and a knowledge base that covers various domains, which offer a novel way to automatically optimize heuristics. Therefore, we propose Planning of Heuristics (PoH), an optimization method that integrates the self-reflection of LLMs with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics (states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions (actions) and evaluation results (rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). The experimental results show that PoH outperforms other hand-crafted heuristics and Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) by other LLMs-based methods, and achieves the significant improvements and the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve COPs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Spline Dimensional Decomposition with Interpolation-based Optimal Knot Selection for Stochastic Dynamic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12879v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forward uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems is challenging due to non-smooth or locally oscillating nonlinear behaviors. Spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) addresses such nonlinearity by partitioning input coordinates via knot placement, but its accuracy is highly sensitive to internal knot locations. Optimizing knots using sequential quadratic programming is effective, yet computationally expensive. We propose a computationally efficient, interpolation-based method for optimal knot selection in SDD. The method includes: (1) interpolating input-output profiles, (2) defining subinterval-based reference regions, and (3) selecting knots at maximum gradient points within each region. The resulting knot vector is then applied to SDD for accurate approximation of non-smooth and oscillatory responses. A modal analysis of a lower control arm shows that SDD with the proposed knots yields higher accuracy than SDD with uniformly or randomly spaced knots and a Gaussian process model. In this example, the proposed SDD achieves the lowest relative variance error (2.89%) for the first natural frequency distribution, compared to uniformly spaced knots (12.310%), randomly spaced knots (15.274%), and Gaussian process (5.319%). All surrogates are constructed using the same 401 simulation datasets, and errors are evaluated against a 2000-sample Monte Carlo simulation. Scalability and applicability are demonstrated through stochastic and reliability analyses of one- and three-dimensional benchmark functions, and a ten-dimensional lower control arm model. Results confirm that second-moment statistics and reliability estimates can be accurately obtained with only a few hundred function evaluations or finite element simulations.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multilevel randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07723v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nested integration problems arise in various scientific and engineering applications, including Bayesian experimental design, financial risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. These nested integrals take the form $\int f\left(\int g(\bs{y},\bs{x})\di{}\bs{x}\right)\di{}\bs{y}$, for nonlinear $f$, making them computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Although widely used for single integrals, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be inefficient when encountering complexities of nested integration. This work introduces a novel multilevel estimator, combining deterministic and randomized quasi-MC (rQMC) methods to handle nested integration problems efficiently. In this context, the inner number of samples and the discretization accuracy of the inner integrand evaluation constitute the level. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the estimator, deriving error bounds demonstrating significant reductions in bias and variance compared with standard methods. The proposed estimator is particularly effective in scenarios where the integrand is evaluated approximately, as it adapts to different levels of resolution without compromising precision. We verify the performance of our method via numerical experiments, focusing on estimating the expected information gain of experiments. When applied to Gaussian noise in the experiment, a truncation scheme ensures finite error bounds at the same computational complexity as in the bounded noise case up to multiplicative logarithmic terms. The results reveal that the proposed multilevel rQMC estimator outperforms existing MC and rQMC approaches, offering a substantial reduction in computational costs and offering a powerful tool for practitioners dealing with complex, nested integration problems across various domains.</p></details> | 40 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Double-loop randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14119v9)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nested integration of the form $\int f\left(\int g(\bs{y},\bs{x})\di{}\bs{x}\right)\di{}\bs{y}$, characterized by an outer integral connected to an inner integral through a nonlinear function $f$, is a challenging problem in various fields, such as engineering and mathematical finance. The available numerical methods for nested integration based on Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be prohibitively expensive owing to the error propagating from the inner to the outer integral. Attempts to enhance the efficiency of these approximations using the quasi-MC (QMC) or randomized QMC (rQMC) method have focused on either the inner or outer integral approximation. This work introduces a novel nested rQMC method that simultaneously addresses the approximation of the inner and outer integrals. The method leverages the unique nested integral structure to offer a more efficient approximation mechanism. Incorporating Owen's scrambling techniques, we address integrands exhibiting infinite variation in the Hardy--Krause sense, enabling theoretically sound error estimates. As the primary contribution, we derive asymptotic error bounds for the bias and variance of our estimator, along with the regularity conditions under which these bounds can be attained. Moreover, we derive a truncation scheme for applications in the context of expected information gain estimation and indicate how to use importance sampling to remedy the measure concentration arising in the inner integral. We verify the estimator quality through numerical experiments by comparing the computational efficiency of the nested rQMC method against standard nested MC estimation for two case studies: one in thermomechanics and the other in pharmacokinetics. These examples highlight the computational savings and enhanced applicability of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 29 pages, 9 figures |

Our optimality criterion is based on the framework of generalized pairwise comparisons. We propose two approaches for estimating optimal ITRs on a pairwise basis. The first approach is a variant of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The second approach is a meta-learning method based on a randomized bagging scheme, which enables the use of any classification algorithm to construct an ITR. We investigate the theoretical properties of these estimation procedures, evaluate their performance through Monte Carlo simulations, and demonstrate their application to clinical trial data.</p></details> |  |
| **[CMCTS: A Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search Framework for Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11169v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (CMCTS) framework to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). By incorporating a constrained action space, Process Reward Model (PRM), and partial order rules, CMCTS effectively addresses the limitations of existing MCTS methods in terms of state space diversity and action selection rationality. Specifically, during the expansion phase, CMCTS restricts action sampling to a predefined constrained action set to increase candidate state diversity. In the simulation phase, it introduces partial order rules and PRM to optimize action selection and prevent unreasonable state transitions. Experimental results show that CMCTS performs outstandingly across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Under a zero-shot setting, a 7B-parameter model achieves an average accuracy of 83.4\%, surpassing the 72B baseline model by 4.8\%. Ablation studies demonstrate that each component of the framework is crucial for performance improvement, and their combined use fully leverages their respective strengths. Overall, the CMCTS framework provides an effective approach to enhancing LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities, supported by theoretical analysis, and offers novel insights for future reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose three core modifications of prior combinations of PNS with MCTS. First, we track proof numbers per player. This reduces code complexity in the sense that we no longer need disproof numbers, and generalizes the technique to be applicable to games with more than two players. Second, we propose and extensively evaluate different methods of using proof numbers to bias the selection strategy, achieving strong performance with strategies that are simpler to implement and compute. Third, we merge our technique with Score Bounded MCTS, enabling the algorithm to prove and leverage upper and lower bounds on scores - as opposed to only proving wins or not-wins. Experiments demonstrate substantial performance increases, reaching the range of 80% for 8 out of the 11 tested board games.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explaining Monte-Carlo Tree Search by Using Its Enhancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13223v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focuses on black-box models within the context of a general policy in a known, specific domain. This paper advocates for the need for knowledge-agnostic explainability applied to the subfield of XAI called Explainable Search, which focuses on explaining the choices made by intelligent search techniques. It proposes Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) enhancements as a solution to obtaining additional data and providing higher-quality explanations while remaining knowledge-free, and analyzes the most popular enhancements in terms of the specific types of explainability they introduce. So far, no other research has considered the explainability of MCTS enhancements. We present a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the advantages of utilizing enhancements.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem in the context of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, we propose a Bayesian active learning strategy based on Gaussian process modeling. The strategy is driven by a novel sampling criterion, which belongs to a broader principle that we refer to as Expected Estimator Modification (EEM). More specifically, the strategy relies on a novel sampling criterion combined with a sequential Monte Carlo framework that enables the construction of batch-sequential designs for the efficient estimation of small quantile sets. The performance of the strategy is illustrated on several synthetic examples and an industrial application case involving the ROTOR37 compressor model.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</p></details> |  |

Slice sampling can resolve local exploration inefficiency issues, and Riemannian geometries help with sharp curvatures. Recent extensions enable slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds, but they are restricted to cases where geodesics are available in a closed form. We propose a method that generalizes Hit-and-Run slice sampling to more general geometries tailored to the target distribution, by approximating geodesics as solutions to differential equations. Our approach enables the exploration of the regions with strong curvature and rapid transitions between modes in multimodal distributions. We demonstrate the advantages of the approach over challenging sampling problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</p></details> |  |

We model the observed outcome vector as a partially observed latent realization from a multivariate linear regression model. Our goal is to estimate simultaneously a sparse matrix ($B$) of latent regression coefficients (i.e., partial covariate effects) and a sparse latent residual precision matrix ($\Omega$), which induces partial correlations between the observed outcomes. To this end, we specify continuous spike-and-slab priors on all entries of $B$ and off-diagonal elements of $\Omega$ and introduce a Monte Carlo Expectation-Conditional Maximization algorithm to compute the maximum a posterior estimate of the model parameters. Under a set of mild assumptions, we derive the posterior contraction rate for our model in the high-dimensional regimes where both $p$ and $q$ diverge with the sample size $n$ and establish a sure screening property, which implies that, as $n$ increases, we can recover all truly non-zero elements of $B$ with probability tending to one. We demonstrate the excellent finite-sample properties of our proposed method, which we call mixed-mSSL, using extensive simulation studies and three applications spanning medicine to ecology.</p></details> |  |

We propose two new Bayesian methods with frequentist validity. The first one places a standard Gaussian process prior on the conditional mean function of the control group. The second method is a double robust Bayesian procedure that adjusts the prior distribution of the conditional mean function and subsequently corrects the posterior distribution of the resulting ATT. We prove new semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorems for both proposals. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian DiD methods exhibit strong finite-sample performance compared to existing frequentist methods. We also present extensions of the canonical DiD approach, incorporating both the staggered design and the repeated cross-sectional design.</p></details> |  |

Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Variational Learning Finds Flatter Solutions at the Edge of Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12903v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Learning (VL) has recently gained popularity for training deep neural networks and is competitive to standard learning methods. Part of its empirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds, minimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to unravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit regularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework. EoS has previously been used to show that gradient descent can find flat solutions and we extend this result to VL to show that it can find even flatter solutions. This is obtained by controlling the posterior covariance and the number of Monte Carlo samples from the posterior. These results are derived in a similar fashion as the standard EoS literature for deep learning, by first deriving a result for a quadratic problem and then extending it to deep neural networks. We empirically validate these findings on a wide variety of large networks, such as ResNet and ViT, to find that the theoretical results closely match the empirical ones. Ours is the first work to analyze the EoS dynamics in VL.</p></details> |  |

With new, more powerful large language models (LLMs) emerging every few months, fine-tuning has become incredibly costly, labor-intensive, and error-prone. As an alternative, zero-shot Text-to-SQL, which leverages the growing knowledge and reasoning capabilities encoded in LLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, presents a promising and more challenging direction. To address this challenge, we propose Alpha-SQL, a novel approach that leverages a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to iteratively infer SQL construction actions based on partial reasoning states. To enhance the framework's reasoning capabilities, we introduce LLM-as-Action-Model to dynamically generate SQL construction actions during the MCTS process, steering the search toward more promising SQL queries. Moreover, Alpha-SQL employs a self-supervised reward function to evaluate the quality of candidate SQL queries, ensuring more accurate and efficient query generation. Experimental results show that Alpha-SQL achieves 69.7% execution accuracy on the BIRD development set, using a 32B open-source LLM without fine-tuning. Alpha-SQL outperforms the best previous zero-shot approach based on GPT-4o by 2.5% on the BIRD development set.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

While proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve high benchmarks scores on SWE-bench, their API dependence, cost, and privacy concerns limit adoption. Open-source alternatives offer transparency but underperform in complex tasks, especially sub-100B parameter models. Although quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data can enhance reasoning, current methods face two critical flaws: (1) weak rejection sampling reduces data quality, and (2) inadequate step validation causes error accumulation. These limitations lead to flawed reasoning chains that impair LLMs'ability to learn reliable issue resolution. The paper proposes MCTS-REFINE, an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithm that dynamically validates and optimizes intermediate reasoning steps through a rigorous rejection sampling strategy, generating high-quality CoT data to improve LLM performance in issue resolution tasks. Key innovations include: (1) augmenting MCTS with a reflection mechanism that corrects errors via rejection sampling and refinement, (2) decomposing issue resolution into three subtasks-File Localization, Fault Localization, and Patch Generation-each with clear ground-truth criteria, and (3) enforcing a strict sampling protocol where intermediate outputs must exactly match verified developer patches, ensuring correctness across reasoning paths. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned with our CoT dataset achieve substantial improvements over baselines.Notably, Qwen2.5-72B- Instruct achieves 28.3%(Lite) and 35.0%(Verified) resolution rates, surpassing SOTA baseline SWE-Fixer-Qwen-72B with the same parameter scale, which only reached 24.7%(Lite) and 32.8%(Verified).</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs typically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities equally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic contribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in scenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a per-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1) \textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2) \textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3) \textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These signals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate soft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we further introduce a \textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which regularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings proportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Experimental results on VQA, image-text retrieval, and captioning tasks show that DMS significantly improves both clean and robust performance, especially under modality corruption or dropout conditions. This work provides a general and effective mechanism to enable instance-aware and robustness-enhanced multimodal modeling.</p></details> |  |

| **[On importance sampling and independent Metropolis-Hastings with an unbounded weight function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09514v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Importance sampling and independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) are among the fundamental building blocks of Monte Carlo methods. Both require a proposal distribution that globally approximates the target distribution. The Radon-Nikodym derivative of the target distribution relative to the proposal is called the weight function. Under the assumption that the weight is unbounded but has finite moments under the proposal distribution, we study the approximation error of importance sampling and of the particle independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (PIMH), which includes IMH as a special case. For the chains generated by such algorithms, we show that the common random numbers coupling is maximal. Using that coupling we derive bounds on the total variation distance of a PIMH chain to its target distribution. Our results allow a formal comparison of the finite-time biases of importance sampling and IMH, and we find the latter to be have a smaller bias. We further consider bias removal techniques using couplings, and provide conditions under which the resulting unbiased estimators have finite moments. These unbiased estimators provide an alternative to self-normalized importance sampling, implementable in the same settings. We compare their asymptotic efficiency as the number of particles goes to infinity, and consider their use in robust mean estimation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages including the proofs in appendices</p></details> |

However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentVigil, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentVigil on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentVigil exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Flower Cluster Matching Using The Unscented Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20631v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring flowers over time is essential for precision robotic pollination in agriculture. To accomplish this, a continuous spatial-temporal observation of plant growth can be done using stationary RGB-D cameras. However, image registration becomes a serious challenge due to changes in the visual appearance of the plant caused by the pollination process and occlusions from growth and camera angles. Plants flower in a manner that produces distinct clusters on branches. This paper presents a method for matching flower clusters using descriptors generated from RGB-D data and considers allowing for spatial uncertainty within the cluster. The proposed approach leverages the Unscented Transform to efficiently estimate plant descriptor uncertainty tolerances, enabling a robust image-registration process despite temporal changes. The Unscented Transform is used to handle the nonlinear transformations by propagating the uncertainty of flower positions to determine the variations in the descriptor domain. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the Unscented Transform results, confirming our method's effectiveness for flower cluster matching. Therefore, it can facilitate improved robotics pollination in dynamic environments.</p></details> | *CASE2025 Accepted* |

| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SRNLD (and SRNLMC) and the acceleration compared to RLD (and PMLC) have been studied in the literature, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that SRNLD can accelerate the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD with this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |

We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics.

| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints.

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast Bayesian Functional Principal Components Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11340v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA) is one of the most successful and widely used analytic tools for exploration and dimension reduction of functional data. Standard implementations of FPCA estimate the principal components from the data but ignore their sampling variability in subsequent inferences. To address this problem, we propose the Fast Bayesian Functional Principal Components Analysis (Fast BayesFPCA), that treats principal components as parameters on the Stiefel manifold. To ensure efficiency, stability, and scalability we introduce three innovations: (1) project all eigenfunctions onto an orthonormal spline basis, reducing modeling considerations to a smaller-dimensional Stiefel manifold; (2) induce a uniform prior on the Stiefel manifold of the principal component spline coefficients via the polar representation of a matrix with entries following independent standard Normal priors; and (3) constrain sampling using the assumed FPCA structure to improve stability.

At the moment, there is only one test suggested that relies upon random projections. We propose a novel test termed {\alpha}-Energy Based Test ({\alpha}-EBT) to compare the multivariate distributions of two (or more) compositional data sets. Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

With this work we aim to provide an integrative view and framework to combine methods from the fields of MCMC, constrained optimization, as well as robotics, and gain insights in their strengths from empirical evaluations. We propose NLP Sampling as a general problem formulation, propose a family of restarting two-phase methods as a framework to integrated methods from across the fields, and evaluate them on analytical and robotic manipulation planning problems. Complementary to this, we provide several conceptual discussions, e.g. on the role of Lagrange parameters, global sampling, and the idea of a Diffused NLP and a corresponding model-based denoising sampler.</p></details> |  |

The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm for approximate sampling from distributions whose support is a compact and convex set. This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

When qualified volunteers are more than the budget allowed, we recommend a D-optimal sampling strategy based on the optimal design theory and develop a constrained lift-one algorithm to find the optimal allocation. Unlike the literature which mainly deals with linear models, our solution solves the constrained sampling problem under fairly general statistical models, including generalized linear models and multinomial logistic models, and with more general constraints. We justify theoretically the optimality of our sampling strategy and show by simulation studies and real-world examples the advantages over simple random sampling and proportionally stratified sampling strategies.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Penalized Overdamped and Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00570v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution $\pi(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ when $x$ is constrained to lie on a convex body $\mathcal{C}$. Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

| **[Unbiased constrained sampling with Self-Concordant Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11925v3)** | 2023-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |

In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01581v4)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Back-translation for Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08712v1)** | 2021-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper illustrates our approach to the shared task on large-scale multilingual machine translation in the sixth conference on machine translation (WMT-21). This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS4Net: Two-Stage Sample Selective Strategy for Rotating Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03116v1)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using the Prior Implicit in a Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13640v3)** | 2021-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior probability models are a fundamental component of many image processing problems, but density estimation is notoriously difficult for high-dimensional signals such as photographic images. Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

For each problem, we propose a privacy preserving algorithm using stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques, and show that it can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. To the best of our knowledge, SSCA has not been used for solving federated optimization, and federated optimization with nonconvex constraints has not been investigated. Next, we customize the two proposed SSCA-based algorithms to two application examples, and provide closed-form solutions for the respective approximate convex problems at each iteration of SSCA. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate inherent advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed, communication cost and model specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICC 2021</p></details> |

They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06311v3)** | 2020-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic execution and fuzzing are two complementary coverage-based testing techniques. How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06922v1)** | 2020-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

While the theory of these problems was thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, prior work either did not scale to industrial size instances or gave up correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. Recently, we proposed a novel approach that combines universal hashing and SAT solving and scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables without giving up correctness guarantees. This paper provides an overview of the key ingredients of the approach and discusses challenges that need to be overcome to handle larger real-world instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in proceedings of AAAI-16 Workshop on Beyond NP</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

This is the case e.g. with strictly positive data and with compositional data, like percentages and the like. If the natural measure of difference is not the absolute one, it is possible to use simple algebraic properties to show that it is more convenient to work with a geometry that is not the usual Euclidean geometry in real space, and with a measure which is not the usual Lebesgue measure, leading to alternative models which better fit the phenomenon under study. The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

Using simulations with (i) correct lag order, (ii) overfitting, and (iii) underfitting, we assess five priors: weakly-informative, horseshoe, Laplace, mixture-of-normals, and hierarchical. With the true lag order, all priors achieve comparable RMSE, though horseshoe and hierarchical slightly reduce bias. Under overfitting, aggressive shrinkage-especially the horseshoe-suppresses noise and improves forecasts, yet no prior rescues a model that omits essential VAR or VMA terms. We then fit B-DARMA to daily SP 500 sector weights using an intentionally large lag structure. Shrinkage priors curb spurious dynamics, whereas weakly-informative priors magnify errors in volatile sectors. Two lessons emerge: (1) match shrinkage strength to the degree of overparameterization, and (2) prioritize correct lag selection, because no prior repairs structural misspecification. These insights guide prior selection and model complexity management in high-dimensional compositional time-series applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warping and Matching Subsequences Between Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15452v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Relationships of Subjects and Shapelets for Semi-supervised Multivariate Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18043v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |
| **[Contrast Similarity-Aware Dual-Pathway Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12222v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |

Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13538v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Oscillatory State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03943v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (Oral) |
| **[Stable CDE Autoencoders with Acuity Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Sepsis Treatment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15019v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI2025 AI4TS</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06687v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semi-Supervised Approach for Abnormal Event Prediction on Large Operational Network Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07660v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE BigData2022</p></details> |

This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Continuous data collection through mobile devices generates highly complex data: entangled multivariate time series of outcomes, exposures, and covariates. Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex data structure of multivariate time series and their non-stationary nature make missing data a major challenge for proper inference. Additional historical information included in time series analyses exacerbates the issue of missing data and also introduces problems for confounding adjustment. The majority of existing imputation methods are either designed for stationary time series or for longitudinal data with limited follow-up periods. The limited work on non-stationary time series either focuses on missing exogenous information or ignores the complex temporal dependence among outcomes, exposures, and covariates. We propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for the state space model (MCEM-SSM) to effectively handle missing data in non-stationary entangled multivariate time series. We demonstrate the method's advantages over other widely used missing data imputation strategies through simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series, subject to various missing mechanisms. Finally, we apply the MCEM-SSM to a multi-year smartphone observational study of bipolar and schizophrenia patients to investigate the association between digital social connectivity and negative mood.</p></details> |  |

We study this problem, considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is identifiable or not.</p></details> |  |

A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</p></details> | in NeuRIPS 2024 |

| **[Leveraging External Factors in Household-Level Electrical Consumption Forecasting using Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14472v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and resource allocation. While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer. We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.</p></details> | ECML PKDD 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Dynamic Environments via PELT-Driven Drift Detection and Model Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14133v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting models are often compromised by data drift, where underlying data distributions change over time, leading to significant declines in prediction performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes an adaptive forecasting framework that integrates drift detection with targeted model retraining to compensate for drift effects. The framework utilizes the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm to identify drift points within the feature space of time series data. Once drift intervals are detected, selective retraining is applied to prediction models using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Lasso Regressor architectures, allowing the models to adjust to changing data patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two datasets: a real-world dataset containing electricity consumption and HVAC system data, and a synthetic financial dataset designed to test cross-domain applicability. Initial baseline models were developed without drift detection using extensive feature engineering. After integrating drift-aware retraining, the MLP model achieved a 44% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 39% increase in R^2 on the real-world dataset, while even greater improvements were observed on the synthetic financial dataset. Similar enhancements were achieved with the Lasso Regressor. These results highlight the robustness and generalizability of incorporating drift detection and adaptive retraining to sustain forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Traditional methods, such as passwords and static biometrics, are vulnerable to spoofing and replay attacks, particularly in high-stakes, continuous interactions. This paper presents a novel anti-spoofing and anti-replay authentication approach that leverages distinctive user behavioral features extracted from haptic feedback during human-robot interactions. To evaluate our authentication approach, we collected a time-series force feedback dataset from 15 participants performing seven distinct tasks. We then developed a transformer-based deep learning model to extract temporal features from the haptic signals. By analyzing user-specific force dynamics, our method achieves over 90 percent accuracy in both user identification and task classification, demonstrating its potential for enhancing access control and identity assurance in tele-robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advantage of linearity, the operator is generally infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the objective is to learn measurement functions that yield a tractable finite-dimensional Koopman operator approximation. In this work, we establish a connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have recently demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling. We show that by considering an extended state consisting of lagged observations, we can establish an equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. Building on this connection, we present SKOLR, which integrates a learnable spectral decomposition of the input signal with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the measurement functions and implements a structured Koopman operator via a highly parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on various forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems show that this streamlined, Koopman-theory-based design delivers exceptional performance.</p></details> |  |

However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on \textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{\textsc{s}}cale \textbf{\textsc{f}}ine\textbf{\textsc{t}}uning (\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (\moirai, \moment\ and \units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

To overcome such challenges, we present FEWSim, a visual analytics framework designed to support domain experts in exploring and interpreting simulation results from a coupled FEW model. FEWSim employs a three-layer asynchronous architecture: the model layer integrates food, energy, and water models to simulate the FEW nexus; the middleware layer manages scenario configuration and execution; and the visualization layer provides interactive visual exploration of simulated time-series results across FEW sectors.

However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning for Industrial Time Series: A Comparative Analysis Using the Example of Screw-Fastening Process Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13909v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in vision but remains largely unexplored for \emph{industrial} time-series data, where annotating every new defect is prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic FSL study on screw-fastening process monitoring, using a 2\,300-sample multivariate torque dataset that covers 16 uni- and multi-factorial defect types. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a \textbf{label-aware episodic sampler} that collapses multi-label sequences into multiple single-label tasks, keeping the output dimensionality fixed while preserving combinatorial label information. Two FSL paradigms are investigated: the metric-based \emph{Prototypical Network} and the gradient-based \emph{Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning} (MAML), each paired with three backbones: 1D CNN, InceptionTime and the 341 M-parameter transformer \emph{Moment}. On 10-shot, 3-way evaluation, the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieves a \textbf{0.944 weighted F1} in the multi-class regime and \textbf{0.935} in the multi-label regime, outperforming finetuned Moment by up to 5.3\% while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training time. Across all backbones, metric learning consistently surpasses MAML, and our label-aware sampling yields an additional 1.7\% F1 over traditional class-based sampling. These findings challenge the assumption that large foundation models are always superior: when data are scarce, lightweight CNN architectures augmented with simple metric learning not only converge faster but also generalize better.

Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines. Our code and dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimus-change/optimus-dataset/.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13705v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Deep Learning for Wildfire Risk Prediction: Integrating Remote Sensing and Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01607v5)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human communities, leading to habitat destruction, pollutant emissions, and biodiversity loss. Accurate wildfire risk prediction is crucial for mitigating these impacts and safeguarding both environmental and human health. This paper provides a comprehensive review of wildfire risk prediction methodologies, with a particular focus on deep learning approaches combined with remote sensing. We begin by defining wildfire risk and summarizing the geographical distribution of related studies. In terms of data, we analyze key predictive features, including fuel characteristics, meteorological and climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, topography, and hydrology, while also reviewing publicly available wildfire prediction datasets derived from remote sensing. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of feature collinearity assessment and model interpretability to improve the understanding of prediction outcomes. Regarding methodology, we classify deep learning models into three primary categories: time-series forecasting, image segmentation, and spatiotemporal prediction, and further discuss methods for converting model outputs into risk classifications or probability-adjusted predictions. Finally, we identify the key challenges and limitations of current wildfire-risk prediction models and outline several research opportunities. These include integrating diverse remote sensing data, developing multimodal models, designing more computationally efficient architectures, and incorporating cross-disciplinary methods--such as coupling with numerical weather-prediction models--to enhance the accuracy and robustness of wildfire-risk assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[PeakWeather: MeteoSwiss Weather Station Measurements for Spatiotemporal Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13652v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are essential for supporting a wide range of activities and decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the impacts of adverse weather events. While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Explainability in the Era of Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13060v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast-Then-Optimize Deep Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13036v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting underpins vital decision-making across various sectors, yet raw predictions from sophisticated models often harbor systematic errors and biases. We examine the Forecast-Then-Optimize (FTO) framework, pioneering its systematic synopsis. Unlike conventional Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO) methods, FTO explicitly refines forecasts through optimization techniques such as ensemble methods, meta-learners, and uncertainty adjustments. Furthermore, deep learning and large language models have established superiority over traditional parametric forecasting models for most enterprise applications. This paper surveys significant advancements from 2016 to 2025, analyzing mainstream deep learning FTO architectures. Focusing on real-world applications in operations management, we demonstrate FTO's crucial role in enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and decision efficacy. Our study establishes foundational guidelines for future forecasting methodologies, bridging theory and operational practicality.</p></details> | 44 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SpaceTrack-TimeSeries: Time Series Dataset towards Satellite Orbit Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13034v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Time Series with LLMs via Patch-Based Prompting and Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12953v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Agnostic, Temperature-Informed Sampling Enhances Cross-Year Crop Mapping with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12885v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons, where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD), based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time. By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain, the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically, produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Lyapunov Learning at the Onset of Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12810v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling regime shifts and non-stationary time series in deep learning systems presents a significant challenge. In the case of online learning, when new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources. Therefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms while preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called \textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts. Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos, where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to small perturbations, evolves around zero over time. Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular, we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic system parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning significantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by about $96\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, HiLD: High-dimensional Learning Dynamics Workshop</p></details> |

This review covers aspects of LHF in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend, seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs, normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL) forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation problem.

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |

Despite advances in methods such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns, concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform, a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios, MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.</p></details> | 13 pages. 7 figures |

Accurate forecasting is critical for monitoring these phenomena and supporting mitigation strategies. While recent data-driven models for time-series forecasting, including CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers, have shown promise, they often struggle with sequential dependencies and limited parallelization, especially in long-horizon, multivariate meteorological datasets. In this work, we present Focal Modulated Attention Encoder (FATE), a novel transformer architecture designed for reliable multivariate time-series forecasting. Unlike conventional models, FATE introduces a tensorized focal modulation mechanism that explicitly captures spatiotemporal correlations in time-series data. We further propose two modulation scores that offer interpretability by highlighting critical environmental features influencing predictions. We benchmark FATE across seven diverse real-world datasets including ETTh1, ETTm2, Traffic, Weather5k, USA-Canada, Europe, and LargeST datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, including temperature datasets. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that FATE generalizes well to broader multivariate time-series forecasting tasks.

| **[Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatiotemporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v3)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/</p></details> |  |

However, prior research on KANs has predominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the frequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring patterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information captured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of KANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By leveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive representation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively learn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from both time and frequency domains, we propose the $\textbf{T}$ime-$\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch architecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring that the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without interference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains, we introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in the frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/LcWave/TFKAN.</p></details> | 11 pages,5 figures |

Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</p></details> |  |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

However, these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder, achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time.

Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Merlin: Multi-View Representation Learning for Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Unfixed Missing Rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12459v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates.

| **[Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the coauthors does not want to post current version of paper, and insists to withdraw the submission</p></details> |

We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal cross-validation impacts multivariate time series subsequence anomaly detection evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12183v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) requires careful consideration of temporal dependencies, particularly when detecting subsequence anomalies common in fault detection scenarios. While time series cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW) methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked sensitivity. This study demonstrates that TSCV design in benchmarking anomaly detection models on streaming time series and provide guidance for selecting evaluation strategies in temporally structured learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

We propose a novel model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate such shortcuts and prevent "Clever-Hans" moments in time series models, we introduce Right on Time (RioT), a novel method that enables interacting with model explanations across both the time and frequency domains. By incorporating feedback on explanations in both domains, RioT constrains the model, steering it away from annotated spurious correlations. This dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing shortcuts in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of RioT in guiding models toward more reliable decision-making across popular time series classification and forecasting datasets, as well as our newly recorded dataset with naturally occuring shortcuts, P2S, collected from a real mechanical production line.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ECML PKDD 2025</p></details> |

The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations are in the field. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.</p></details> | Accepted By KDD 2025 |

The study is based on mastitis detection in dairy cows using a hypothetical herd management system. We designed four exemplary explanation formats for mastitis assessments with different types of presentation (textual, rule-based, herd comparison, and time series). In our previous study, 14 dairy farmers in Germany had rated these formats in terms of comprehensibility and the trust they would have in a system providing each format. In this study, we repeat the survey with 13 software providers active in the German dairy industry. We ask them how well they think the formats would be received by farmers. We hypothesized that there may be discrepancies between the views of both groups that are worth investigating, partly to find reasons for the reluctance to adopt digital systems. A comparison of the feedback from both groups supports the hypothesis and calls for further investigation. The results show that software providers tend to make assumptions about farmers' preferences that are not necessarily accurate. Our study, although not representative due to the small sample size, highlights the potential benefits of a thorough user requirements analysis (farmers' needs) to improve software adaptation and user acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2024, Explainable AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Functional-Coefficient Models for Multivariate Time Series in Designed Experiments: with Applications to Brain Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00292v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To study the neurophysiological basis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clinicians use electroencephalography (EEG) which record neuronal electrical activity on the cortex. Instead of focusing on single-channel spectral power, a novel framework for investigating interactions (dependence) between channels in the entire network is proposed. Although dependence measures such as coherence and partial directed coherence (PDC) are well explored in studying brain connectivity, these measures only capture linear dependence. Moreover, in designed clinical experiments, these dependence measures are observed to vary across subjects even within a homogeneous group. To address these limitations, we propose the mixed-effects functional-coefficient autoregressive (MXFAR) model which captures between-subject variation by incorporating subject-specific random effects. The advantages of the MXFAR model are the following: (i) it captures potential non-linear dependence between channels; (ii) it is nonparametric and hence flexible and robust to model mis-specification; (iii) it can capture differences between groups when they exist; (iv) it accounts for variation across subjects; (v) the framework easily incorporates well-known inference methods from mixed-effects models; (vi) it can be generalized to accommodate various covariates and factors. Then, we formulate a novel non-linear spectral measure, the functional partial directed coherence (fPDC), to extract dynamic cross-dependence patterns at different frequency oscillations. Finally, we apply the proposed MXFAR-fPDC framework to analyze multichannel EEG signals and report novel findings on altered brain functional networks in ADHD patients.</p></details> |  |

This approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types, offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for large-scale disaster monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the WACV 2025 Workshop on GeoCV.

However, in the context of limited and noisy data, accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions. Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables, by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI) transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state (vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm. Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms and outline promising research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-step Estimating Approach for Heavy-tailed AR Models with General Non-zero Median Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11509v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a novel two-step estimating procedure for heavy-tailed AR models with non-zero median noises, allowing for time-varying volatility. We first establish the self-weighted quantile regression estimator (SQE) across all quantile levels $\tau\in (0,1)$ for the AR parameters $\theta_{0}$. We show that the SQE, minus a bias, converges weakly to a Gaussian process uniformly at a rate of $n^{-1/2}$. The bias is zero if and only if $\tau$ equals $\tau_{0}$, the probability that the noise is less than zero. Based on the SQE, we propose an approach to estimate $\tau_{0}$ in the second step and {feed the estimated $\hat{\tau}_n$ back into the SQE to estimate $\theta_0$.} Both the estimated $\tau_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A random weighting bootstrap method is developed to approximate the complicated distribution. The problem we study is non-standard because $\tau_{0}$ may not be identifiable in conventional quantile regression, and the usual methods cannot verify the existence of the SQE bias. Unlike existing procedures for heavy-tailed time series, our method does not require any classical identification conditions, such as zero-mean or zero-median.</p></details> |  |

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application, thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements. This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the usage and development of localization approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Time-Series Foundation Models Perform Building Energy Management Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11250v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets, have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited} generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 tables, 8 figures.

Two types of techniques are commonly used to reduce the number of parameters - regularization and dimension reduction. In this project, we combine them by imposing a sparse factor structure and propose a regularized estimator to further reduce the number of parameters in factor models. A challenge limiting the widespread application of factor models is that factors are hard to interpret, as both factors and the loading matrix are unobserved. To address this, we introduce a penalty term when estimating the loading matrix for a sparse estimate. As a result, each factor only drives a smaller subset of time series that exhibit the strongest correlation, improving the factor interpretability. The theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are investigated. The simulation results are presented to confirm that our algorithm performs well. We apply our method to Hawaii tourism data. The results indicate that two groups drive the number of domestic tourists in Hawaii: visitors from high-latitude states (factor 1) and visitors from inland or low-latitude states (factor 2). It reveals two main reasons people visit Hawaii: (1) to escape the cold and (2) to enjoy the beach and water activities.</p></details> |  |

The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[STOAT: Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09544v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |

Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[PromptTSS: A Prompting-Based Approach for Interactive Multi-Granularity Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11170v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review.

| **[TimeBridge: Better Diffusion Prior Design with Bridge Models for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06672v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis testing. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach to time series generation, enabling diverse synthesis scenarios. However, the fixed standard-Gaussian diffusion prior may be ill-suited for general time series data, such as temporal order and fixed points. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that flexibly synthesizes time series data by using diffusion bridges to learn paths between a chosen prior and the data distribution. We then explore several prior designs tailored to time series synthesis. Our framework covers (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional generation and (ii) scale-preserving priors for conditional generation. Experiments show that our framework with data-driven priors outperforms standard diffusion models on time series generation.</p></details> |  |

Despite a recent increase in automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are often unavailable. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the operational Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System, it relies only on geostationary infrared (IR) satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 9 channels at lag times up to 4 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for tropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors with microwave or scatterometer data, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification, producing a well calibrated ensemble of 150 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AMS journal Weather and Forecasting.

In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on Transformers for Vision (T4V): https://sites.google.com/view/t4v-cvpr25/accepted-papers</p></details> |
| **[Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |

Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Share Secrets for Privacy: Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in many applications, such as healthcare and manufacturing. Critical challenges to address include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address these challenges and propose ``Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL'' (STV), a novel framework with the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically-partitioned data; ii) decentralised forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; and iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for exact parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal tuning complexity. We evaluate on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. Our exact optimization outperforms centralized methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also evaluate scalability by examining the communication costs of exact and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two.

| **[Neural Functions for Learning Periodic Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09526v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered CPI Prediction Inference with Online Text Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09516v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency, survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |

| **[Versatile Symbolic Music-for-Music Modeling via Function Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15548v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many music AI models learn a map between music content and human-defined labels. However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model (LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[RE-IMAGINE: Symbolic Benchmark Synthesis for Reasoning Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15455v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.</p></details> | version 3 |
| **[Enhancing Symbolic Machine Learning by Subsymbolic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14569v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of neuro-symbolic AI is to integrate symbolic and subsymbolic AI approaches, to overcome the limitations of either. Prominent systems include Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) or DeepProbLog, which offer neural predicates and end-to-end learning. The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score. The approach could be useful beyond this setting: Enhancing symbolic learners in this way could be extended to similarities between instances (effectively working like kernels within a logical language), for analogical reasoning, or for propositionalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (vision) language models as well as purely neural models show poor generalization to \emph{a-priori} unseen complex concepts. Neuro-symbolic methods (Grand et al., 2023) offer a promising alternative by searching in program space, but face challenges in large program spaces due to the inability to effectively guide the search using demonstrations. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as: (i) {\it Sketch:} detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) {\it Plan:} performing an MCTS search over grounded action sequences guided by human demonstrations (iii) {\it Generalize:} abstracting out grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular re-use, enabling continual concept learning. Our approach combines the benefits of code generation ability of large language models (LLMs) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures vis-\'a-vis LLM-only and purely neural approaches. Further, we demonstrate reasoning and planning capabilities with learned concepts for embodied instruction following.</p></details> | <details><summary>Progr...</summary><p>Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning Worskop, ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Verification Learning: Make Unsupervised Neuro-Symbolic System Feasible](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12917v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) Learning paradigm suffers from an over-reliance on labeled data, so if we completely disregard labels, it leads to less symbol information, a larger solution space, and more shortcuts-issues that current Nesy systems cannot resolve. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Verification Learning (VL), which addresses this challenge by transforming the label-based reasoning process in Nesy into a label-free verification process. VL achieves excellent learning results solely by relying on unlabeled data and a function that verifies whether the current predictions conform to the rules. We formalize this problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) and propose a Dynamic Combinatorial Sorting (DCS) algorithm that accelerates the solution by reducing verification attempts, effectively lowering computational costs and introduce a prior alignment method to address potential shortcuts. Our theoretical analysis points out which tasks in Nesy systems can be completed without labels and explains why rules can replace infinite labels for some tasks, while for others the rules have no effect. We validate the proposed framework through several fully unsupervised tasks including addition, sort, match, and chess, each showing significant performance and efficiency improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, symbolic-domain controllable music generation has lagged behind partly due to the lack of a large-scale symbolic music dataset with extensive metadata and captions. In this work, we present MetaScore, a new dataset consisting of 963K musical scores paired with rich metadata, including free-form user-annotated tags, collected from an online music forum. To approach text-to-music generation, We employ a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate pseudo-natural language captions for music from its metadata tags. With the LLM-enhanced MetaScore, we train a text-conditioned music generation model that learns to generate symbolic music from the pseudo captions, allowing control of instruments, genre, composer, complexity and other free-form music descriptors. In addition, we train a tag-conditioned system that supports a predefined set of tags available in MetaScore. Our experimental results show that both the proposed text-to-music and tags-to-music models outperform a baseline text-to-music model in a listening test. While a concurrent work Text2MIDI also supports free-form text input, our models achieve comparable performance. Moreover, the text-to-music system offers a more natural interface than the tags-to-music model, as it allows users to provide free-form natural language prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> |

Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as oral presentation at UAI 25</p></details> |

However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/MIDI-RWKV.</p></details> |  |

We present SymRAG, a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query routing based on real-time complexity and system load assessments. SymRAG dynamically selects symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align resource use with query demands. Evaluated on 2,000 queries from HotpotQA and DROP using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves 97.6--100.0% exact match accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization (3.6--6.2%) and processing time (0.985--3.165s). Disabling adaptive logic results in 169--1151% increase in processing time, highlighting the framework's impact. These results underscore the potential of adaptive neuro-symbolic routing for scalable, sustainable AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.</p></details> |  |

The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires, computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies, fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the TISMIR</p></details> |

This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.</p></details> |  |

While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Primender Sequence: A Novel Mathematical Construct for Testing Symbolic Inference and AI Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10585v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it, the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, 3 codes, oeis sequence A384735</p></details> |

This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion, and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational efficiency, and data quality.

Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Proof Generation with LLMs: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14479v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p></details> | long paper |

The construction uses powers of $2$ and $3$ in combination with modular inversion in $\mathbb{Z}/3^p\mathbb{Z}$, leading to a parametric identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples exhibiting low radical values. Through affine transformations, these symbolic triples are embedded into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimised for the ratio $\log c / \log \operatorname{rad}(abc)$. Computational results demonstrate the emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known and novel triples. These methods provide a symbolic and algebraic framework for controlled triple generation, and suggest exploratory implications for symbolic entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, includes tables and illustrative examples; discusses symbolic generation of abc-triples and applications in entropy filtering and cryptographic pre-processing</p></details> |

While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development.</p></details> |  |

To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. For better performance in partially observable and volatile environments, the symbolic policies are extended with memory represented by continuous-time latent variables, governed by differential equations. Genetic programming is used for optimisation, resulting in interpretable policies consisting of symbolic expressions. Our results show that symbolic policies with memory compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in symbolic policies is demonstrated on experiments where memory-less policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages including references and appendix, 7 figures, 1 algorithm, 6 tables</p></details> |

Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation (error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax, while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap, we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search, intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space; (3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy. Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand the original data.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we focus on learning abstract symbolic world models that facilitate zero-shot generalization to novel goals via planning. A critical component of such models is the set of symbolic predicates that define properties of and relationships between objects. In this work, we leverage pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to propose a large set of visual predicates potentially relevant for decision-making, and to evaluate those predicates directly from camera images. At training time, we pass the proposed predicates and demonstrations into an optimization-based model-learning algorithm to obtain an abstract symbolic world model that is defined in terms of a compact subset of the proposed predicates. At test time, given a novel goal in a novel setting, we use the VLM to construct a symbolic description of the current world state, and then use a search-based planning algorithm to find a sequence of low-level skills that achieves the goal. We demonstrate empirically across experiments in both simulation and the real world that our method can generalize aggressively, applying its learned world model to solve problems with a wide variety of object types, arrangements, numbers of objects, and visual backgrounds, as well as novel goals and much longer horizons than those seen at training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08171v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model, WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.</p></details> |  |

Two of the most fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem, administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, Additional resources available on GitHub repository</p></details> |

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing SR methods do not scale to datasets with a large number of input variables (referred to as extreme-scale SR), which is common in modern scientific applications. This ``large $p$'' setting, often accompanied by measurement error, leads to slow performance of SR methods and overly complex expressions that are difficult to interpret. To address this scalability challenge, we propose a method called PAN+SR, which combines a key idea of ab initio nonparametric variable selection with SR to efficiently pre-screen large input spaces and reduce search complexity while maintaining accuracy. The use of nonparametric methods eliminates model misspecification, supporting a strategy called parametric-assisted nonparametric (PAN). We also extend SRBench, an open-source benchmarking platform, by incorporating high-dimensional regression problems with various signal-to-noise ratios. Our results demonstrate that PAN+SR consistently enhances the performance of 19 contemporary SR methods, enabling several to achieve state-of-the-art performance on these challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, which enables real-time interactive generation.</p></details> |  |

Although the performance of standard reception algorithms is seriously deteriorated by the nonlinear distortion, the more advanced solutions allow the utilization of additional frequency diversity caused by nonlinear PA. However, while most of the advanced receivers are decision-aided, their gains are observed mostly in a relatively low Bit Error Rate (BER) region, not targeted by adaptive Modulation Coding Schemes utilizing Forward Error Correction (FEC). In this paper, a non-decision-aided Higher-Order Combining (HOC) reception scheme is proposed. While the analytical formulas for finding symbols combining coefficients are not known, machine learning is used for deriving them. The simulation results show an improved BER performance with respect to a standard reception and one of the established decision-aided receivers. However, as HOC has computational complexity that increases rapidly with the number of subcarriers utilized, more studies are needed to apply it in a wideband system.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

To shed light on these issues, we study the internal mechanisms that support abstract reasoning in LLMs. We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a paper that has been accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance.

Finding a general methodology for verifying such programs is challenging due to both the number of different tools involved and the intricate interface between the ``neural'' and ``symbolic'' program components. In this paper we present a general decomposition of the neuro-symbolic verification problem into parts, and examine the problem of the embedding gap that occurs when one tries to combine proofs about the neural and symbolic components. To address this problem we then introduce Vehicle -- standing as an abbreviation for a ``verification condition language'' -- an intermediate programming language interface between machine learning frameworks, automated theorem provers, and dependently-typed formalisations of neuro-symbolic programs. Vehicle allows users to specify the properties of the neural components of neuro-symbolic programs once, and then safely compile the specification to each interface using a tailored typing and compilation procedure. We give a high-level overview of Vehicle's overall design, its interfaces and compilation & type-checking procedures, and then demonstrate its utility by formally verifying the safety of a simple autonomous car controlled by a neural network, operating in a stochastic environment with imperfect information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pushe...</summary><p>Pushed in Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction 2025</p></details> |

In our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions -- eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld, where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals (e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking, and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but in constructive logic and proof theory.</p></details> |  |

This is an extensive field which almost entirely relies on worst-case bit complexity, and we start from a basic problem in the field: isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials. This is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation and it is arguably one of the most basic problems in computational mathematics. The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and furnishes an active area of research. However, most available results in literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge this gap. We demonstrate (quasi-)linear (expected and smoothed) complexity bounds for Descartes algorithm, that is one most well know symbolic algorithms for isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials with integer coefficients. Our results explain the surprising efficiency of Descartes solver in comparison to sophisticated algorithms that have superior worst-case complexity. We also analyse the Sturm solver, ANewDsc a symbolic-numeric algorithm that combines Descartes with Newton operator, and a symbolic algorithm for sparse polynomials.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

| **[The Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) Problem: From Symbolic Path Inversion to Post-Quantum Cryptographic Keys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04383v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical cryptographic systems rely heavily on structured algebraic problems, such as factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based assumptions, which are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks and structural cryptanalysis. In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories generated via contractive affine maps over $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively, achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on algebraic hardness assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generating Controllable and Solvable Geometry Problem by Leveraging Symbolic Deduction Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02565v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality geometry problems is both an important and challenging task in education. Compared to math word problems, geometry problems further emphasize multi-modal formats and the translation between informal and formal languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel task for geometry problem generation and propose a new pipeline method: the Symbolic Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). The framework leverages a symbolic deduction engine and contains four main steps: (1) searching a predefined mapping table from knowledge points to extended definitions, (2) sampling extended definitions and performing symbolic deduction, (3) filtering out unqualified problems, and (4) generating textual problems and diagrams. Specifically, our method supports to avoid inherent biases in translating natural language into formal language by designing the mapping table, and guarantees to control the generated problems in terms of knowledge points and difficulties by an elaborate checking function. With obtained formal problems, they are translated to natural language and the accompanying diagrams are automatically drew by rule-based methods. We conduct experiments using real-world combinations of knowledge points from two public datasets. The results demonstrate that the SDE-GPG can effectively generate readable, solvable and controllable geometry problems.</p></details> | To Appear in ACL'25 |

Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning. Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning. Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https: //github.com/mbzuai-nlp/finchain.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for balancing neural and symbolic components.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures.

To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Neuro-symbolic Systems (NeuS 2025)</p></details> |

The method first transforms a multivariate time series into a symbolic sequence, and then extract statistically significant strings of symbols through a Bayesian approach. Such motifs are finally modelled as the hyperedges of a hypergraph, allowing us to use network theory to study higher-order interactions in the original data. When applied to neural and social systems, our method reveals meaningful higher-order dependencies, highlighting their importance in both brain function and social behaviour.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (5 pages main manuscript and 10 pages supplemental material), 9 figures (2 main manuscript and 7 supplemental material)</p></details> |

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views.

While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform OpenAI o1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs can generate equations or solve math-related queries, their ability to fully understand and interpret abstract mathematical symbols in long, math-rich documents remains limited. In this paper, we introduce STEM-PoM, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on math symbols within contextual scientific text. The dataset, sourced from real-world ArXiv documents, contains over 2K math symbols classified as main attributes of variables, constants, operators, and unit descriptors, with additional sub-attributes including scalar/vector/matrix for variables and local/global/discipline-specific labels for both constants and operators. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve an average accuracy of 20-60% under in-context learning and 50-60% with fine-tuning, highlighting a substantial gap in their ability to classify mathematical symbols. By improving LLMs' mathematical symbol classification, STEM-PoM further enhances models' downstream mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches. To facilitate reproducible research, we developed Variable Scope, an interactive web platform for exploring our findings at https://variablescope.org</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[The Road to Generalizable Neuro-Symbolic Learning Should be Paved with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24874v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question: What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

Enlightened by this progress, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach for symbolic regression. We construct a random mask-based diffusion and denoising process to generate diverse and high-quality equations. We integrate this generative processes with a token-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to conduct efficient reinforcement learning on the given measurement dataset. In addition, we introduce a long short-term risk-seeking policy to expand the pool of top-performing candidates, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Our work is aligned with the popular DSR framework which focuses on learning a data-specific expression generator, without relying on pretrained models or additional search or planning procedures. Despite the success of existing DSR methods, they are built on recurrent neural networks, solely guided by data fitness, and potentially meet tail barriers that can zero out the policy gradient, causing inefficient model updates. To overcome these limitations, we design a decoder-only architecture that performs attention in the frequency domain and introduce a dual-indexed position encoding to conduct layer-wise generation. Second, we propose a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based reward function that can automatically adjust the trade-off between expression complexity and data fitness, without the need for explicit manual tuning. Third, we develop a ranking-based weighted policy update method that eliminates the tail barriers and enhances training effectiveness. Extensive benchmarks and systematic experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Using this representation, we construct a novel neuro-symbolic pair and evaluate its performance. We show that our symbolic method learns taxonomic nets more efficiently with less data and compute, while the neural method finds higher-accuracy taxonomic nets when provided with greater resources. As a neuro-symbolic pair, these approaches can be used interchangeably based on situational needs, with seamless translation between them when necessary.

| **[Neuro-Symbolic Operator for Interpretable and Generalizable Characterization of Complex Piezoelectric Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24578v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex piezoelectric systems are foundational in industrial applications. Their performance, however, is challenged by the nonlinear voltage-displacement hysteretic relationships. Efficient characterization methods are, therefore, essential for reliable design, monitoring, and maintenance. Recently proposed neural operator methods serve as surrogates for system characterization but face two pressing issues: interpretability and generalizability. State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural operators are black-boxes, providing little insight into the learned operator. Additionally, generalizing them to novel voltages and predicting displacement profiles beyond the training domain is challenging, limiting their practical use. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a neuro-symbolic operator (NSO) framework that derives the analytical operators governing hysteretic relationships. NSO first learns a Fourier neural operator mapping voltage fields to displacement profiles, followed by a library-based sparse model discovery method, generating white-box parsimonious models governing the underlying hysteresis. These models enable accurate and interpretable prediction of displacement profiles across varying and out-of-distribution voltage fields, facilitating generalizability. The potential of NSO is demonstrated by accurately predicting voltage-displacement hysteresis, including butterfly-shaped relationships. Moreover, NSO predicts displacement profiles even for noisy and low-fidelity voltage data, emphasizing its robustness. The results highlight the advantages of NSO compared to SOTA neural operators and model discovery methods on several evaluation metrics. Consequently, NSO contributes to characterizing complex piezoelectric systems while improving the interpretability and generalizability of neural operators, essential for design, monitoring, maintenance, and other real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly couples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.</p></details> |  |

Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23395v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Consistency is Vital: Neural-Symbolic Information Retrieval for Negative-Constraint Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22299v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information retrieval plays a crucial role in resource localization. Current dense retrievers retrieve the relevant documents within a corpus via embedding similarities, which compute similarities between dense vectors mainly depending on word co-occurrence between queries and documents, but overlook the real query intents. Thus, they often retrieve numerous irrelevant documents. Particularly in the scenarios of complex queries such as \emph{negative-constraint queries}, their retrieval performance could be catastrophic. To address the issue, we propose a neuro-symbolic information retrieval method, namely \textbf{NS-IR}, that leverages first-order logic (FOL) to optimize the embeddings of naive natural language by considering the \emph{logical consistency} between queries and documents. Specifically, we introduce two novel techniques, \emph{logic alignment} and \emph{connective constraint}, to rerank candidate documents, thereby enhancing retrieval relevance. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset \textbf{NegConstraint} including negative-constraint queries to evaluate our NS-IR's performance on such complex IR scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NS-IR not only achieves superior zero-shot retrieval performance on web search and low-resource retrieval tasks, but also performs better on negative-constraint queries.

ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic `perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and 97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models). This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code repository: https://github.com/RamanujanMachine/ASyMOB Complete benchmark dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shalyt/ASyMOB-Algebraic_Symbolic_Mathematical_Operations_Benchmark</p></details> |

In this work, we propose DRAGON (Discrete Representation and Augmented Graph encoding Over deBruijN Graphs), a novel encoder that introduces Multivariate de Bruijn Graphs (MdBGs) to bridge the gap between symbolic representations and neural modeling. DRAGON discretizes continuous input sequences and maps them onto a fixed graph structure, enabling dynamic context recovery via graph-based attention. Integrated as an auxiliary module within a dual-branch architecture, DRAGON augments conventional CNN-based encoders with symbolic, structure-aware representations.

While mathematically powerful, these structures can be exploited by quantum algorithms or advanced algebraic attacks, raising a pressing need for structure-free alternatives. To address this gap, we introduce the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), a new computational hardness assumption based on symbolic trajectories generated by contractive affine maps with bounded noise over Z2. Unlike traditional systems, SPIP is inherently non-algebraic and relies on chaotic symbolic evolution and rounding-induced non-injectivity to render inversion computationally infeasible. We prove that SPIP is PSPACE-hard and #P-hard, and demonstrate through empirical simulation that even short symbolic sequences (e.g., n = 3, m = 2) can produce over 500 valid trajectories for a single endpoint, with exponential growth reaching 2256 paths for moderate parameters. A quantum security analysis further shows that Grover-style search offers no practical advantage due to oracle ambiguity and verification instability. These results position SPIP as a viable foundation for post-quantum cryptography that avoids the vulnerabilities of algebraic symmetry while offering scalability, unpredictability, and resistance to both classical and quantum inversion.</p></details> |  |

In orchestral music, in particular, the composer can select specific characteristics for each instrument's part within the accompaniment, while also needing to adapt the melody to suit the capabilities of the instruments performing it. In this work, we propose METEOR, a model for Melody-aware Texture-controllable Orchestral music generation. This model performs symbolic multi-track music style transfer with a focus on melodic fidelity. We allow bar- and track-level controllability of the accompaniment with various textural attributes while keeping a homophonic texture. We show that the model can achieve controllability performances similar to strong baselines while greatly improve melodic fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 34rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025) - AI, Arts and Creativity Special Track.

It has been applied in various fields of scientific research, such as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena. Recently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers pre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While these methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from low performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In this study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization bias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found that Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data. Additional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the Transformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while verifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time strategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We empirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at test time can significantly mitigate memorization bias. On the other hand, we also find that reducing memorization bias does not necessarily correlate with improved performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of NSR approaches and offer a foundation for designing more robust, generalizable symbolic regression methods.

| **[Symbolically Regressing Fish Biomass Spectral Data: A Linear Genetic Programming Method with Tunable Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21901v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques play an important role in analyzing spectral data. The spectral data of fish biomass is useful in fish production, as it carries many important chemistry properties of fish meat. However, it is challenging for existing machine learning techniques to comprehensively discover hidden patterns from fish biomass spectral data since the spectral data often have a lot of noises while the training data are quite limited. To better analyze fish biomass spectral data, this paper models it as a symbolic regression problem and solves it by a linear genetic programming method with newly proposed tunable primitives. In the symbolic regression problem, linear genetic programming automatically synthesizes regression models based on the given primitives and training data. The tunable primitives further improve the approximation ability of the regression models by tuning their inherent coefficients. Our empirical results over ten fish biomass targets show that the proposed method improves the overall performance of fish biomass composition prediction. The synthesized regression models are compact and have good interpretability, which allow us to highlight useful features over the spectrum. Our further investigation also verifies the good generality of the proposed method across various spectral data treatments and other symbolic regression problems.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven machine learning technology can significantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual process of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into fundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry, ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 60 pages |

End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying open-domain video data at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Working paper</p></details> |
| **[Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight (v4: 47 pages, 26 figures, project page: https://sgp-bench.github.io/)</p></details> |

To advance assured AI, we advocate for a paradigm shift that imbues data-driven perception models with symbolic structure, inspired by a human's ability to reason over low-level features and high-level context. We propose a neuro-symbolic paradigm for perception (NeuSPaPer) and illustrate how joint object detection and scene graph generation (SGG) yields deep scene understanding.~Powered by foundation models for offline knowledge extraction and specialized SGG algorithms for real-time deployment, we design a framework leveraging structured relational graphs that ensures the integrity of situational awareness in autonomy. Using physics-based simulators and real-world datasets, we demonstrate how SGG bridges the gap between low-level sensor perception and high-level reasoning, establishing a foundation for resilient, context-aware AI and advancing trusted autonomy in CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of memorization on LLM reasoning.</p></details> | Work in progress |

The high energy consumption of analog-to-digital converters resulting from their high resolution constituted a major limitation for future wireless communications systems, which will require low energy consumption and low-complexity devices at the transmitter and at the receiver. In this regard, we present a novel precoding method based on quality of service constraints for a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink system with 1-bit quantization and oversampling. For this scenario, we consider the time-instance zero-crossing modulation, which conveys the information into the zero-crossings of the signals. Unlike prior works the proposed constraint is given in terms of the symbol error probability related to the minimum distance to the decision threshold and is included in the proposed optimization problem that is used in the design of the precoder. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed precoding method evaluated under different parameters and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2502.16367</p></details> |

Conditioned on an ECG and a textual query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology, identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans. To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources. Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works, three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next generation of ELMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |

Previous neuro-symbolic robotic studies mostly focused on discovering perceptual symbolic categories given a pre-defined action repertoire and generating plans with given action symbols. A truly developmental robotic system, on the other hand, should be able to discover all the abstractions required for the planning system with minimal human intervention. In this study, we propose a novel system that is designed to discover symbolic action primitives along with perceptual symbols autonomously. Our system is based on an encoder-decoder structure that takes object and action information as input and predicts the generated effect. To efficiently explore the vast continuous action parameter space, we introduce a Curiosity-Based exploration module that selects the most informative actions -- the ones that maximize the entropy in the predicted effect distribution. The discovered symbolic action primitives are then used to make plans using a symbolic tree search strategy in single- and double-object manipulation tasks. We compare our model with two baselines that use different exploration strategies in different experiments. The results show that our approach can learn a diverse set of symbolic action primitives, which are effective for generating plans in order to achieve given manipulation goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICDL 2025</p></details> |

We present ADLGen, a generative framework specifically designed to synthesize realistic, event triggered, and symbolic sensor sequences for ambient assistive environments. ADLGen integrates a decoder only Transformer with sign based symbolic temporal encoding, and a context and layout aware sampling mechanism to guide generation toward semantically rich and physically plausible sensor event sequences. To enhance semantic fidelity and correct structural inconsistencies, we further incorporate a large language model into an automatic generate evaluate refine loop, which verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates correction rules without manual intervention or environment specific tuning. Through comprehensive experiments with novel evaluation metrics, ADLGen is shown to outperform baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic richness, and downstream activity recognition, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for ADL data synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing studies and applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased findings and diminished performance of LA applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: similarity-based analyses and integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Beyond performance, additional factors such as cost, regulatory compliance, and model transparency are discussed as key considerations for model selection. Overall, this study underscores the importance for LA researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions.</p></details> |  |

Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, supplementary material (appendix) included separately</p></details> |

However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, current image tokenization methods demonstrate significant limitations in tasks requiring symbolic abstraction and logical reasoning capabilities essential for systematic inference. To address this challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in general vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning, consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines, showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and R1-like training paradigms.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.</p></details> |  |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Slow-...</summary><p>Slow-thinking, Large Language Models, Human-like Reasoning, Decision Making in AI, AGI</p></details> |

However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Scaling up Intervention Models</p></details> |

However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code, data, and model can be found at this repository: https://github.com/JHU-CLSP/Rationalyst</p></details> |
| **[TeleMath: A Benchmark for Large Language Models in Telecom Mathematical Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10674v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVINET: Towards Open-World Graph Learning via Evidential Reasoning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07288v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Spurious Correlations in LLMs via Causality-Aware Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09433v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability. Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution (ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11128v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383 reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate. These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language model reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>TTODL...</summary><p>TTODLer-FM Workshop@ICML'25 (Tiny Titans: The next wave of On-Device Learning for Foundational Models)</p></details> |

This framework offers visualisations at various modelling stages and seamlessly integrates large language models and logical reasoning engines.

| **[Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15817v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.</p></details> | 38 pages |

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Collapse: How Language-Centric Foundation Models Shape Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05850v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates; (ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |

We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata.

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

Chart Question Answering (CQA) is an emerging task focused on the automatic interpretation and reasoning of data presented in charts. However, chart images are inherently difficult to interpret, and chart-related questions often involve complex logical and numerical reasoning, which hinders the performance of existing models. This paper introduces VProChart, a novel framework designed to address these challenges in CQA by integrating a lightweight Visual Perception Alignment Agent (VPAgent) and a Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach. VPAgent aligns and models chart elements based on principles of human visual perception, enhancing the understanding of chart context. The Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to transform natural language reasoning questions into structured solution programs, facilitating precise numerical and logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ChartQA and PlotQA demonstrate that VProChart significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its capability in understanding and reasoning with charts.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowCoder-V2: Deep Knowledge Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06881v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR}) framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability. Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline. Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner. To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes, transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover, when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research framework.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

| **[Dissecting Logical Reasoning in LLMs: A Fine-Grained Evaluation and Supervision Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04810v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition, to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Reasoning Potential of Pre-trained LLMs by Critique Fine-Tuning on One Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03295v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Abductive visual Generation (AbdGen) approach to build such logic-integrated models. A vector-quantized symbol grounding mechanism and the corresponding disentanglement training method are introduced to enhance the controllability of logical symbols over generation. Furthermore, we propose two logical abduction methods to make our approach require few labeled training data and support the induction of latent logical generative rules from data. We experimentally show that our approach can be utilized to integrate various neural generative models with logical reasoning systems, by both learning from scratch or utilizing pre-trained models directly. The code is released at https://github.com/future-item/AbdGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2025 research track paper</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation metrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with 1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed across both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's reliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that most LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

| **[Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 (Survey Track)</p></details> |

However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Entailment Checking: Explore Eigenmarking Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03771v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic entailment is essential to reasoning, but entailment checking has the worst-case complexity of an exponential of the variable size. With recent development, quantum computing when mature may allow an effective approach for various combinatorial problems, including entailment checking. Grover algorithm uses Grover operations, selective phase inversion and amplitude amplification to address a search over unstructured data with quadratic improvement from a classical method. Its original form is intended to a single-winner scenario: exactly one match is promised. Its extension to multiple-winner cases employs probabilistic control over a number of applications of Grover operations, while a no-winner case is handled by time-out. Our study explores various schemes of ``eigenmarking'' approach. Still relying on Grover operations, but the approach introduces additional qubits to tag the eigenstates. The tagged eigenstates are to facilitate an interpretation of the measured results and enhance identification of a no-winner case (related to no logic violation in entailment context). Our investigation experiments three variations of eigenmarking on a two-qubit system using an IBM Aer simulator. The results show strong distinguishability in all schemes with the best relative distinguishabilities of 19 and 53 in worst case and in average case, respectively. Our findings reveal a viable quantum mechanism to differentiate a no-winner case from other scenarios, which could play a pivot role in entailment checking and logic reasoning in general.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Robustness of Prompting: Enhancing Robustness of Large Language Models Against Prompting Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03627v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance. Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> | 13pages |

While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15806v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/NumericBench.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial challenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored. We constructed and published two new textual entailment datasets NoFEVER-ML and NoSNLI-ML in four languages (English, Czech, German, and Ukrainian) with examples differing in negation. It allows investigation of the root causes of the negation problem and its exemplification: how popular LLM model properties and language impact their inability to handle negation correctly. Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size may improve the models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the models' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent and that the length and explicitness of the premise have an impact on robustness. There is better accuracy in projective language with fixed order, such as English, than in non-projective ones, such as German or Czech. Our entailment datasets pave the way to further research for explanation and exemplification of the negation problem, minimization of LLM hallucinations, and improvement of LLM reasoning in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers outperform previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Surrogate Signals from Format and Length: Reinforcement Learning for Solving Mathematical Problems without Ground Truth Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19439v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving, bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers. Our study shows that a reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases. Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain scenarios, achieving 40.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: the powerful base model is like an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.</p></details> |  |

While recent advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in logical reasoning and multi-task generalization, their applications in Re-ID tasks remain limited. They either struggle to perform accurate matching based on identity-relevant features or assist image-dominated branches as auxiliary semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ChatReID, that shifts the focus towards a text-side-dominated retrieval paradigm, enabling flexible and interactive re-identification. To integrate the reasoning abilities of language models into Re-ID pipelines, We first present a large-scale instruction dataset, which contains more than 8 million prompts to promote the model fine-tuning. Next. we introduce a hierarchical progressive tuning strategy, which endows Re-ID ability through three stages of tuning, i.e., from person attribute understanding to fine-grained image retrieval and to multi-modal task reasoning. Extensive experiments across ten popular benchmarks demonstrate that ChatReID outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all Re-ID tasks. More experiments demonstrate that ChatReID not only has the ability to recognize fine-grained details but also to integrate them into a coherent reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. We also observe a significant performance boost when LLMs are provided with external tools for oracle math and logic operations. These results highlight significant challenges and promising research directions in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.

However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details, and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable Image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach.

While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex. Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs, particularly via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality preference data, which is labor-intensive to annotate and crucial for reward model (RM) finetuning. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CodePMP, a scalable preference model pretraining (PMP) pipeline that utilizes a large corpus of synthesized code-preference pairs from publicly available high-quality source code. CodePMP improves RM finetuning efficiency by pretraining preference models on large-scale synthesized code-preference pairs. We evaluate CodePMP on mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and logical reasoning tasks (ReClor, LogiQA2.0), consistently showing significant improvements in reasoning performance of LLMs and highlighting the importance of scalable preference model pretraining for efficient reward modeling.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[HyperTree Planning: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Hierarchical Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02322v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.14228 by other authors</p></details> |

Can LLMs Logically Reason Through Counterfactuals?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22318v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Structured Unplugged Approach for Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21398v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning.

To study this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning categories: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an robust evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and the LMM-as-a-judge approach. We conducted experiments evaluating nine prominent visual editing models, comprising both open-source and proprietary models. The evaluation results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in reasoning-based editing tasks. Even the most powerful model evaluated, GPT-4o-Image, achieves an accuracy of merely 28.8%. RISEBench effectively highlights the limitations of contemporary editing models, provides valuable insights, and indicates potential future directions for the field of reasoning-aware visual editing. Our code and data have been released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross from Left to Right Brain: Adaptive Text Dreamer for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20897v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{https://github.com/zhangpingrui/Adaptive-Text-Dreamer}{here}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-Wise Formal Verification for LLM-Based Mathematical Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20869v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning improves reasoning quality but requires vast labeled data, while reward-maximizing reinforcement learning finds top-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ACL 2025 main</p></details> |

While studies have examined LLM capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of memorization on LLM reasoning.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes, demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework, this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving, substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges, and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments.

Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models.

However, LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries, leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction (CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy (FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong performance, validating its generality and robustness.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++) demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning, without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose \textbf{HopRAG}, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, HopRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections established via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a \textit{retrieve-reason-prune} mechanism: starting with lexically or semantically similar passages, the system explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to identify truly relevant ones. Experiments on multiple multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that HopRAG's \textit{retrieve-reason-prune} mechanism can expand the retrieval scope based on logical connections and improve final answer quality.</p></details> |  |

Automated chart understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher, a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach to chart comprehension.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |

First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARCO: Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing for Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17481v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning, which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective, focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover, to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoT: Highlighted Chain of Thought for Referencing Supporting Facts from Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02003v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models, and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the best overall performance.

The principled integration of reasoning and learning in neural networks is a main objective of the area of neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this chapter, a simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system is described that can represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula. This creates a powerful combination of learning from data and knowledge and logical reasoning. We start by positioning neurosymbolic AI in the context of the current AI landscape that is unsurprisingly dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify important challenges of data efficiency, fairness and safety of LLMs that might be addressed by neurosymbolic reasoning systems with formal reasoning capabilities. We then discuss the representation of logic by the specific energy-based system, including illustrative examples and empirical evaluation of the correspondence between logical reasoning and energy minimization using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Learning from data and knowledge is also evaluated empirically and compared with a symbolic, neural and a neurosymbolic system. Results reported in this chapter in an accessible way are expected to reignite the research on the use of neural networks as massively-parallel models for logical reasoning and promote the principled integration of reasoning and learning in deep networks. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the importance of positioning neurosymbolic AI within a broader framework of formal reasoning and accountability in AI, discussing the challenges for neurosynbolic AI to tackle the various known problems of reliability of deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 13 figures, 56 references.

| **[MedAgent-Pro: Towards Evidence-based Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis via Reasoning Agentic Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18968v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern medicine, clinical diagnosis relies on the comprehensive analysis of primarily textual and visual data, drawing on medical expertise to ensure systematic and rigorous reasoning. Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Competent AI for Fundamental Analysis in Finance: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07315v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information, calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.</p></details> |  |

We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning. Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs (``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in prompt engineering, existing approaches still face limitations in handling complex logical reasoning tasks. To address these issues, JoT introduces a multi-agent approach with three specialized roles$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$lawyer, prosecutor, and judge$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$where a high-level model acts as the judge, and lower-level models serve as lawyer and prosecutor to systematically debate and evaluate arguments. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks such as BigBenchHard and Winogrande demonstrate JoT's superior performance compared to existing prompting approaches, achieving notable improvements, including 98\% accuracy in Boolean expressions. Also, our ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each role, iterative refinement loops, and feedback mechanisms. Consequently, JoT significantly enhances accuracy, reliability, and consistency in binary reasoning tasks and shows potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to +5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%) and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%), functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/CoT-Bridge/</p></details> |
| **[Systematic Evaluation of Machine-Generated Reasoning and PHQ-9 Labeling for Depression Detection Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17119v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile, quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B. Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9 symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves significant performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages without references</p></details> |
| **[DB-Explore: Automated Database Exploration and Instruction Synthesis for Text-to-SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04959v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-SQL systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in translating natural language queries into SQL. However, these systems often struggle with complex database structures and domain-specific queries, as they primarily focus on enhancing logical reasoning and SQL syntax while overlooking the critical need for comprehensive database understanding. To address this limitation, we propose DB-Explore, a novel framework that systematically aligns LLMs with database knowledge through automated exploration and instruction synthesis. DB-Explore constructs database graphs to capture complex relational schemas, leverages GPT-4 to systematically mine structural patterns and semantic knowledge, and synthesizes instructions to distill this knowledge for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. Our framework enables comprehensive database understanding through diverse sampling strategies and automated instruction generation, bridging the gap between database structures and language models. Experiments conducted on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks validate the effectiveness of DB-Explore, achieving an execution accuracy of 67.0% on BIRD and 87.8% on SPIDER. Notably, our open-source implementation based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B achieves state-of-the-art results at minimal computational cost, outperforming several GPT-4-driven Text-to-SQL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FOL-Pretrain: A complexity annotated corpus of first-order logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14932v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities such as coding and solving mathematical problems to commonsense inference. While these tasks vary in complexity, they all require models to integrate and compute over structured information. Despite recent efforts to reverse-engineer LLM behavior through controlled experiments, our understanding of how these models internalize and execute complex algorithms remains limited. Progress has largely been confined to small-scale studies or shallow tasks such as basic arithmetic and grammatical pattern matching. One barrier to deeper understanding is the nature of pretraining data -- vast, heterogeneous, and often poorly annotated, making it difficult to isolate mechanisms of reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale, fully open, complexity-annotated dataset of first-order logic reasoning traces, designed to probe and analyze algorithmic reasoning in LLMs. The dataset consists of 3.5 billion tokens, including 8.8 million LLM-augmented, human-annotated examples and 7.5 million synthetically generated examples. Each synthetic example is verifiably correct, produced by a custom automated theorem solver, and accompanied by metadata tracing its algorithmic provenance. We aim to provide a scalable, interpretable artifact for studying how LLMs learn and generalize symbolic reasoning processes, paving the way for more transparent and targeted investigations into the algorithmic capabilities of modern models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATBench: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Reasoning via Automated Puzzle Generation from SAT Formulas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14615v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for future research in logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepGate4: Efficient and Effective Representation Learning for Circuit Design at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01681v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit representation learning has become pivotal in electronic design automation, enabling critical tasks such as testability analysis, logic reasoning, power estimation, and SAT solving. However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.

| **[Learning from Committee: Reasoning Distillation from a Mixture of Teachers with Peer-Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03663v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning capabilities typically emerge in large language models (LLMs) with tens of billions of parameters, recent research focuses on improving smaller open-source models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. However, many of these studies rely solely on responses from a single LLM as the gold rationale, unlike the natural human learning process, which involves understanding both the correct answers and the reasons behind mistakes. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware DistIllation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) instead of merely obtaining rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data; 2) we design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, and selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold, which reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhuochunli/Learn-from-Committee.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Beyond Single-Task: Robust Multi-Task Length Generalization for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11525v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Length generalization, the ability to solve problems longer than those seen during training, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). Previous work modifies positional encodings (PEs) and data formats to improve length generalization on specific symbolic tasks such as addition and sorting. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited to special tasks, often degrading general language performance. Furthermore, they are typically evaluated on small transformers trained from scratch on single tasks and can cause performance drop when applied during post-training stage of practical LLMs with general capabilities. Hu et al., (2024) proposed Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) to improve length generalization in the post-training stage of LLMs. Despite its compatibility with practical models and strong performance, RFFT is proposed for single tasks too, requiring re-training for each individual task with extensive examples. In this paper, we study length generalization in multi-task settings and propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT), the first framework enabling robust cross-task length generalization. As our first contribution, we construct a large length generalization dataset containing 86 tasks spanning code execution, number processing, symbolic and logical reasoning tasks, beyond the common addition or multiplication tasks. Secondly, we show that cross-task length generalization is possible with Meta-RFFT. After training on a large number of tasks and instances, the models achieve remarkable length generalization ability on unseen tasks with minimal fine-tuning or one-shot prompting. For example, after fine-tuning on 1 to 5 digit addition, our 32B model achieves 95% accuracy on 30 digit addition, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1-671B: 72%), despite never seeing this task during RF-pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-OCR: Can Large Multimodal Models Solve Complex Logical Reasoning Problems from OCR Cues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12766v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become increasingly versatile, accompanied by impressive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) related capabilities. Existing OCR-related benchmarks emphasize evaluating LMMs' abilities of relatively simple visual question answering, visual-text parsing, etc. However, the extent to which LMMs can deal with complex logical reasoning problems based on OCR cues is relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce the Reasoning-OCR benchmark, which challenges LMMs to solve complex reasoning problems based on the cues that can be extracted from rich visual-text. Reasoning-OCR covers six visual scenarios and encompasses 150 meticulously designed questions categorized into six reasoning challenges. Additionally, Reasoning-OCR minimizes the impact of field-specialized knowledge. Our evaluation offers some insights for proprietary and open-source LMMs in different reasoning challenges, underscoring the urgent to improve the reasoning performance. We hope Reasoning-OCR can inspire and facilitate future research on enhancing complex reasoning ability based on OCR cues. Reasoning-OCR is publicly available at https://github.com/Hxyz-123/ReasoningOCR.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on complex logical reasoning tasks involving text-rich images remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark comprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical reasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by curating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples. First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts, ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences, and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as a valuable resource for advancing multimodal reasoning research.

| **[Efficient RL Training for Reasoning Models via Length-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12284v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Curriculum Abductive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12275v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs, which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex knowledge setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[BARREL: Boundary-Aware Reasoning for Factual and Reliable LRMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13529v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. However, current LRMs rarely admit ignorance or respond with "I don't know". Instead, they often produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 39.33% to 61.48%, while still achieving accuracy comparable to models finetuned on reasoning data generated by R1. These results demonstrate that our pilot study is inspiring to build more reliable and factual System 2 LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Logical Reasoning Abilities of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11854v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models, often post-trained on long chain-of-thought (long CoT) data with reinforcement learning, achieve state-of-the-art performance on mathematical, coding, and domain-specific reasoning benchmarks. However, their logical reasoning capabilities - fundamental to human cognition and independent of domain knowledge - remain understudied. To address this gap, we introduce LogiEval, a holistic benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in large reasoning models. LogiEval spans diverse reasoning types (deductive, inductive, analogical, and abductive) and task formats (e.g., logical sequence, argument analysis), sourced from high-quality human examinations (e.g., LSAT, GMAT). Our experiments demonstrate that modern reasoning models excel at 4-choice argument analysis problems and analogical reasoning, surpassing human performance, yet exhibit uneven capabilities across reasoning types and formats, highlighting limitations in their generalization. Our analysis reveals that human performance does not mirror model failure distributions. To foster further research, we curate LogiEval-Hard, a challenging subset identified through a novel screening paradigm where small-model failures (Qwen3-30B-A3B) reliably predict difficulties for larger models. Modern models show striking, consistent failures on LogiEval-Hard. This demonstrates that fundamental reasoning bottlenecks persist across model scales, and establishes LogiEval-Hard as both a diagnostic tool and a rigorous testbed for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Might Not Care What You Are Saying: Prompt Format Beats Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08780v5)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the help of in-context learning (ICL), large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various tasks. However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code will be publicly available once this paper is published.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Capability Boundary of DeepSeek Models: An Application-Driven Performance Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11164v5)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DeepSeek-R1, known for its low training cost and exceptional reasoning capabilities, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. However, detailed evaluations for DeepSeek Series models from the perspective of real-world applications are lacking, making it challenging for users to select the most suitable DeepSeek models for their specific needs. To address this gap, we presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the DeepSeek and its related models (including DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama series, their corresponding 4-bit quantized models, and the reasoning model QwQ-32B) using our enhanced A-Eval benchmark, A-Eval-2.0. Our systematic analysis reveals several key insights: (1) Given identical model architectures and training data, larger parameter models demonstrate superior performance, aligning with the scaling law. However, smaller models may achieve enhanced capabilities when employing optimized training strategies and higher-quality data; (2) Reasoning-enhanced model show significant performance gains in logical reasoning tasks but may underperform in text understanding and generation tasks; (3) As the data difficulty increases, distillation or reasoning enhancements yield higher performance gains for the models. Interestingly, reasoning enhancements can even have a negative impact on simpler problems; (4) Quantization impacts different capabilities unevenly, with significant drop on logical reasoning and minimal impact on text generation. Based on these results and findings, we design an model selection handbook enabling users to select the most cost-effective models without efforts.</p></details> |  |
