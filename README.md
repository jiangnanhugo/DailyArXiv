| **[Making Sense of Touch: Unsupervised Shapelet Learning in Bag-of-words Sense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04167v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces NN-STNE, a neural network using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) as a hidden layer to reduce input dimensions by mapping long time-series data into shapelet membership probabilities. A Gaussian kernel-based mean square error preserves local data structure, while K-means initializes shapelet candidates due to the non-convex optimization challenge. Unlike existing methods, our approach uses t-SNE to address crowding in low-dimensional space and applies L1-norm regularization to optimize shapelet length. Evaluations on the UCR dataset and an electrical component manipulation task, like switching on, demonstrate improved clustering accuracy over state-of-the-art feature-learning methods in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Pseudo Markov-Chain Model and Time-Elapsed Measures of Mobility from Collective Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04162v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we develop a pseudo Markov-chain model to understand time-elapsed flows, over multiple intervals, from time and space aggregated collective inter-location trip data, given as a time-series. Building on the model, we develop measures of mobility that parallel those known for individual mobility data, such as the radius of gyration. We apply these measures to the NetMob 2024 Data Challenge data, and obtain interesting results that are consistent with published statistics and commuting patterns in cities. Besides building a new framework, we foresee applications of this approach to an improved understanding of human mobility in the context of environmental changes and sustainable development.</p></details> | 27 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Bayesian Hierarchical Copula Models with a Dirichlet-Laplace Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13689v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discuss a Bayesian hierarchical copula model for clusters of financial time series. A similar approach has been developed in recent paper. However, the prior distributions proposed there do not always provide a proper posterior. In order to circumvent the problem, we adopt a proper global-local shrinkage prior, which is also able to account for potential dependence structures among different clusters. The performance of the proposed model is presented via simulations and a real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the importance of structural identifiability for machine learning with partially observed dynamical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04131v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The successful application of modern machine learning for time series classification is often hampered by limitations in quality and quantity of available training data. To overcome these limitations, available domain expert knowledge in the form of parametrised mechanistic dynamical models can be used whenever it is available and time series observations may be represented as an element from a given class of parametrised dynamical models. This makes the learning process interpretable and allows the modeller to deal with sparsely and irregularly sampled data in a natural way. However, the internal processes of a dynamical model are often only partially observed. This can lead to ambiguity regarding which particular model realization best explains a given time series observation. This problem is well-known in the literature, and a dynamical model with this issue is referred to as structurally unidentifiable. Training a classifier that incorporates knowledge about a structurally unidentifiable dynamical model can negatively influence classification performance. To address this issue, we employ structural identifiability analysis to explicitly relate parameter configurations that are associated with identical system outputs. Using the derived relations in classifier training, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves the classifier's ability to generalize to unseen data on a number of example models from the biomedical domain. This effect is especially pronounced when the number of training instances is limited. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for structural identifiability, a topic that has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Quasi maximum likelihood estimation of high-dimensional approximate dynamic matrix factor models via the EM algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04112v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers an approximate dynamic matrix factor model that accounts for the time series nature of the data by explicitly modelling the time evolution of the factors. We study Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation of the model parameters based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented jointly with the Kalman smoother which gives estimates of the factors. This approach allows to easily handle arbitrary patterns of missing data. We establish the consistency of the estimated loadings and factor matrices as the sample size $T$ and the matrix dimensions $p_1$ and $p_2$ diverge to infinity. The finite sample properties of the estimators are assessed through a large simulation study and an application to a financial dataset of volatility proxies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Trees That Remember: Gradient-Based Learning of Recurrent Decision Trees with Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04052v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and State-Space Models have shown great success in handling sequential data by learning temporal dependencies. Decision Trees (DTs), on the other hand, remain a widely used class of models for structured tabular data but are typically not designed to capture sequential patterns directly. Instead, DT-based approaches for time-series data often rely on feature engineering, such as manually incorporating lag features, which can be suboptimal for capturing complex temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce ReMeDe Trees, a novel recurrent DT architecture that integrates an internal memory mechanism, similar to RNNs, to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Our model learns hard, axis-aligned decision rules for both output generation and state updates, optimizing them efficiently via gradient descent. We provide a proof-of-concept study on synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[PINT: Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models with Applications to Long-term Inference on WeatherBench 2m-Temperature Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04018v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications. Our models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/KV-Park.</p></details> |  |
| **[The ARR2 prior: flexible predictive prior definition for Bayesian auto-regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19920v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the ARR2 prior, a joint prior over the auto-regressive components in Bayesian time-series models and their induced $R^2$. Compared to other priors designed for times-series models, the ARR2 prior allows for flexible and intuitive shrinkage. We derive the prior for pure auto-regressive models, and extend it to auto-regressive models with exogenous inputs, and state-space models. Through both simulations and real-world modelling exercises, we demonstrate the efficacy of the ARR2 prior in improving sparse and reliable inference, while showing greater inference quality and predictive performance than other shrinkage priors. An open-source implementation of the prior is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection, Retrieval, and Explanation Unified: A Violence Detection System Based on Knowledge Graphs and GAT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06224v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Random forests for binary geospatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13828v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manuscript develops new method and theory for non-linear regression for binary dependent data using random forests. Existing implementations of random forests for binary data cannot explicitly account for data correlation common in geospatial and time-series settings. For continuous outcomes, recent work has extended random forests (RF) to RF-GLS that incorporate spatial covariance using the generalized least squares (GLS) loss. However, adoption of this idea for binary data is challenging due to the use of the Gini impurity measure in classification trees, which has no known extension to model dependence. We show that for binary data, the GLS loss is also an extension of the Gini impurity measure, as the latter is exactly equivalent to the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss. This justifies using RF-GLS for non-parametric mean function estimation for binary dependent data. We then consider the special case of generalized mixed effects models, the traditional statistical model for binary geospatial data, which models the spatial random effects as a Gaussian process (GP). We propose a novel link-inversion technique that embeds the RF-GLS estimate of the mean function from the first step within the generalized mixed effects model framework, enabling estimation of non-linear covariate effects and offering spatial predictions. We establish consistency of our method, RF-GP, for both mean function and covariate effect estimation. The theory holds for a general class of stationary absolutely regular dependent processes that includes common choices like Gaussian processes with Mat\'ern or compactly supported covariances and autoregressive processes. The theory relaxes the common assumption of additive mean functions and accounts for the non-linear link. We demonstrate that RF-GP outperforms competing methods for estimation and prediction in both simulated and real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-based Evolving Fuzzy System for Time Series Forecasting: New Perspectives Based on Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Measures Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03650v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data contain uncertainty and variations that can be correlated to external variables, known as randomness. An alternative cause of randomness is chaos, which can be an important component of chaotic time series. One of the existing methods to deal with this type of data is the use of the evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFSs), which have been proven to be a powerful class of models for time series forecasting, due to their autonomy to handle the data and highly complex problems in real-world applications. However, due to its working structure, type-2 fuzzy sets can outperform type-1 fuzzy sets for highly uncertain scenarios. We then propose ePL-KRLS-FSM+, an enhanced class of evolving fuzzy modeling approach that combines participatory learning (PL), a kernel recursive least squares method (KRLS), type-2 fuzzy logic and data transformation into fuzzy sets (FSs). This improvement allows to create and measure type-2 fuzzy sets for better handling uncertainties in the data, generating a model that can predict chaotic data with increased accuracy. The model is evaluated using two complex datasets: the chaotic time series Mackey-Glass delay differential equation with different degrees of chaos, and the main stock index of the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index - TAIEX. Model performance is compared to related state-of-the-art rule-based eFS models and classical approaches and is analyzed in terms of error metrics, runtime and the number of final rules. Forecasting results show that the proposed model is competitive and performs consistently compared with type-1 models, also outperforming other forecasting methods by showing the lowest error metrics and number of final rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swarm Characteristic Classification using Robust Neural Networks with Optimized Controllable Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03619v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Having the ability to infer characteristics of autonomous agents would profoundly revolutionize defense, security, and civil applications. Our previous work was the first to demonstrate that supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) could rapidly predict the tactics of swarming autonomous agents in military contexts, providing intelligence to inform counter-maneuvers. However, most autonomous interactions, especially military engagements, are fraught with uncertainty, raising questions about the practicality of using a pretrained classifier. This article addresses that challenge by leveraging expected operational variations to construct a richer dataset, resulting in a more robust NN with improved inference performance in scenarios characterized by significant uncertainties. Specifically, diverse datasets are created by simulating variations in defender numbers, defender motions, and measurement noise levels. Key findings indicate that robust NNs trained on an enriched dataset exhibit enhanced classification accuracy and offer operational flexibility, such as reducing resources required and offering adherence to trajectory constraints. Furthermore, we present a new framework for optimally deploying a trained NN by the defenders. The framework involves optimizing defender trajectories that elicit adversary responses that maximize the probability of correct NN tactic classification while also satisfying operational constraints imposed on the defenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning of Dynamic Bayesian Network via Continuous Optimization from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09814v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, learning the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network has been centralized, requiring all data to be pooled in one location. However, in real-world scenarios, data are often distributed across multiple entities (e.g., companies, devices) that seek to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving data privacy and security. More importantly, due to the presence of diverse clients, the data may follow different distributions, resulting in data heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses additional challenges for centralized approaches. In this study, we first introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from homogeneous time series data that are horizontally distributed across different parties. We then extend this approach to heterogeneous time series data by incorporating a proximal operator as a regularization term in a personalized federated learning framework. To this end, we propose \texttt{FDBNL} and \texttt{PFDBNL}, which leverage continuous optimization, ensuring that only model parameters are exchanged during the optimization process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in scenarios with many clients and limited individual sample sizes.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[A Multi-Task Learning Approach to Linear Multivariate Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03571v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data is important in many engineering and scientific applications. Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/azencot-group/MTLinear</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Time Series Forecasting Models: From Statistical Techniques to Foundation Models in Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03395v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential for operational intelligence in the hospitality industry, and particularly challenging in large-scale, distributed systems. This study evaluates the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), deep learning, and foundation models in forecasting hourly sales over a 14-day horizon using real-world data from a network of thousands of restaurants across Germany. The forecasting solution includes features such as weather conditions, calendar events, and time-of-day patterns. Results demonstrate the strong performance of ML-based meta-models and highlight the emerging potential of foundation models like Chronos and TimesFM, which deliver competitive performance with minimal feature engineering, leveraging only the pre-trained model (zero-shot inference). Additionally, a hybrid PySpark-Pandas approach proves to be a robust solution for achieving horizontal scalability in large-scale deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPE: Covariate-Adjusted Pre-Training for Epidemic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of epidemic infection trajectories is crucial for safeguarding public health. However, limited data availability during emerging outbreaks and the complex interaction between environmental factors and disease dynamics present significant challenges for effective forecasting. In response, we introduce CAPE, a novel epidemic pre-training framework designed to harness extensive disease datasets from diverse regions and integrate environmental factors directly into the modeling process for more informed decision-making on downstream diseases. Based on a covariate adjustment framework, CAPE utilizes pre-training combined with hierarchical environment contrasting to identify universal patterns across diseases while estimating latent environmental influences. We have compiled a diverse collection of epidemic time series datasets and validated the effectiveness of CAPE under various evaluation scenarios, including full-shot, few-shot, zero-shot, cross-location, and cross-disease settings, where it outperforms the leading baseline by an average of 9.9% in full-shot and 14.3% in zero-shot settings. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers and Their Roles as Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03383v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give a comprehensive analysis of transformers as time series foundation models, focusing on their approximation and generalization capabilities. First, we demonstrate that there exist transformers that fit an autoregressive model on input univariate time series via gradient descent. We then analyze MOIRAI, a multivariate time series foundation model capable of handling an arbitrary number of covariates. We prove that it is capable of automatically fitting autoregressive models with an arbitrary number of covariates, offering insights into its design and empirical success. For generalization, we establish bounds for pretraining when the data satisfies Dobrushin's condition. Experiments support our theoretical findings, highlighting the efficacy of transformers as time series foundation models.</p></details> | 34 Pages, 2 Figures |
| **[PaPaGei: Open Foundation Models for Optical Physiological Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20542v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the leading non-invasive technique for monitoring biosignals and cardiovascular health, with widespread adoption in both clinical settings and consumer wearable devices. While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and an encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series Granger Causality Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08958v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Granger causality inference Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANGCI), a novel architecture that extends the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to the domain of causal inference. By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty and ridge regularization, KANGCI effectively infers the Granger causality from time series. Additionally, we propose an algorithm based on time-reversed Granger causality that automatically selects causal relationships with better inference performance from the original or time-reversed time series or integrates the results to mitigate spurious connectivities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Lorenz-96, Gene regulatory networks, fMRI BOLD signals, VAR, and real-world EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods in inferring Granger causality from nonlinear, high-dimensional, and limited-sample time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Time-series Model for Universal Knowledge Representation of Multivariate Time-Series data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03264v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal knowledge representation is a central problem for multivariate time series(MTS) foundation models and yet remains open. This paper investigates this problem from the first principle and it makes four folds of contributions. First, a new empirical finding is revealed: time series with different time granularities (or corresponding frequency resolutions) exhibit distinct joint distributions in the frequency domain. This implies a crucial aspect of learning universal knowledge, one that has been overlooked by previous studies. Second, a novel Fourier knowledge attention mechanism is proposed to enable learning time granularity-aware representations from both the temporal and frequency domains. Third, an autoregressive blank infilling pre-training framework is incorporated to time series analysis for the first time, leading to a generative tasks agnostic pre-training strategy. To this end, we develop the General Time-series Model (GTM), a unified MTS foundation model that addresses the limitation of contemporary time series models, which often require token, pre-training, or model-level customizations for downstream tasks adaption. Fourth, extensive experiments show that GTM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all generative tasks, including long-term forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03245v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> |

Counting how often a specific ordinal pattern occurs in a time series provides important insights into the properties of the time series. In this work, we prove the asymptotic normality of the relative frequency of ordinal patterns for time series with linear increments. Moreover, we apply ordinal patterns to detect changes in the distribution of a time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Anomaly Detection in the Frequency Domain with Statistical Reliability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03062v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective anomaly detection in complex systems requires identifying change points (CPs) in the frequency domain, as abnormalities often arise across multiple frequencies. This paper extends recent advancements in statistically significant CP detection, based on Selective Inference (SI), to the frequency domain. The proposed SI method quantifies the statistical significance of detected CPs in the frequency domain using $p$-values, ensuring that the detected changes reflect genuine structural shifts in the target system. We address two major technical challenges to achieve this. First, we extend the existing SI framework to the frequency domain by appropriately utilizing the properties of discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Second, we develop an SI method that provides valid $p$-values for CPs where changes occur across multiple frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reliably identifies genuine CPs with strong statistical guarantees, enabling more accurate root-cause analysis in the frequency domain of complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoCL: Topological Contrastive Learning for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02924v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal time series representation learning is challenging but valuable in real-world applications such as classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been actively explored to tackle time series representation. However, a key challenge is that the data augmentation process in CL can distort seasonal patterns or temporal dependencies, inevitably leading to a loss of semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose Topological Contrastive Learning for time series (TopoCL). TopoCL mitigates such information loss by incorporating persistent homology, which captures the topological characteristics of data that remain invariant under transformations. In this paper, we treat the temporal and topological properties of time series data as distinct modalities. Specifically, we compute persistent homology to construct topological features of time series data, representing them in persistence diagrams. We then design a neural network to encode these persistent diagrams. Our approach jointly optimizes CL within the time modality and time-topology correspondence, promoting a comprehensive understanding of both temporal semantics and topological properties of time series. We conduct extensive experiments on four downstream tasks-classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that TopoCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TNNLS (under review)</p></details> |
| **[MobiCLR: Mobility Time Series Contrastive Learning for Urban Region Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02912v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning effective representations of urban regions has gained significant attention as a key approach to understanding urban dynamics and advancing smarter cities. Existing approaches have demonstrated the potential of leveraging mobility data to generate latent representations, providing valuable insights into the intrinsic characteristics of urban areas. However, incorporating the temporal dynamics and detailed semantics inherent in human mobility patterns remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel urban region representation learning model, Mobility Time Series Contrastive Learning for Urban Region Representations (MobiCLR), designed to capture semantically meaningful embeddings from inflow and outflow mobility patterns. MobiCLR uses contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative power of its representations, applying an instance-wise contrastive loss to capture distinct flow-specific characteristics. Additionally, we develop a regularizer to align output features with these flow-specific representations, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of mobility dynamics. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments in Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C. to predict income, educational attainment, and social vulnerability. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Sciences (under review)</p></details> |
| **[Latent Space Energy-based Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03845v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces novel deep dynamical models designed to represent continuous-time sequences. Our approach employs a neural emission model to generate each data point in the time series through a non-linear transformation of a latent state vector. The evolution of these latent states is implicitly defined by a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE), with the initial state drawn from an informative prior distribution parameterized by an Energy-based model (EBM). This framework is extended to disentangle dynamic states from underlying static factors of variation, represented as time-invariant variables in the latent space. We train the model using maximum likelihood estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on oscillating systems, videos and real-world state sequences (MuJoCo) demonstrate that our model with the learnable energy-based prior outperforms existing counterparts, and can generalize to new dynamic parameterization, enabling long-horizon predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SensorChat: Answering Qualitative and Quantitative Questions during Long-Term Multimodal Sensor Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02883v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for enabling all users to comprehend sensor data and its impact on their everyday lives. However, existing systems, which typically operate in a Question Answering (QA) manner, are significantly limited in terms of the duration and complexity of sensor data they can handle. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for long-term sensor monitoring with multimodal and high-dimensional data including time series. SensorChat effectively answers both qualitative (requiring high-level reasoning) and quantitative (requiring accurate responses derived from sensor data) questions in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline that includes question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for intuitive human interactions and to guide the sensor data query process. Unlike existing multimodal LLMs, SensorChat incorporates an explicit query stage to precisely extract factual information from long-duration sensor data. We implement SensorChat and demonstrate its capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 26% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in handling qualitative and open-ended questions.</p></details> | Under review |

However, despite advances in CD methods, their practical application in real-world contexts remains limited due to the diverse input data and the applicational context. For example, the collected RSIs can be time-series observations, and more informative results are required to indicate the time of change or the specific change category. Moreover, training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) requires a massive amount of training samples, whereas in many cases these samples are difficult to collect. To address these challenges, various specific CD methods have been developed considering different application scenarios and training resources. Additionally, recent advancements in image generation, self-supervision, and visual foundation models (VFMs) have opened up new approaches to address the 'data-hungry' issue of DL-based CD. The development of these methods in broader application scenarios requires further investigation and discussion. Therefore, this article summarizes the literature methods for different CD tasks and the available strategies and techniques to train and deploy DL-based CD methods in sample-limited scenarios. We expect that this survey can provide new insights and inspiration for researchers in this field to develop more effective CD methods that can be applied in a wider range of contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE GRSM</p></details> |

While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://anon-forecast.github.io/benchmark_report_dev/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review.

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |

However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02410v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Typically, synthetic data are based on historical data obtained from the observed system. The data needs to represent a specific behavior of the system, yet be new and diverse enough so that the system is challenged with a broad range of inputs. This paper presents a method, based on discrete Fourier transform, for generating synthetic time series with similar statistical moments for any given signal. The suggested method makes it possible to control the level of similarity between the given signal and the generated synthetic signals. Proof shows analytically that this method preserves the first two statistical moments of the input signal, and its autocorrelation function. The method is compared to known methods, ARMA, GAN, and CoSMoS. A large variety of environmental datasets with different temporal resolutions, and from different domains are used, testing the generality and flexibility of the method. A Python library implementing this method is made available as open-source software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication 27 November 2024.

Traditional machine learning algorithms rely on well-defined input and output variables; however, there are scenarios where the separation between the input and output variables and the underlying, associated input and output layers of the model are unknown. Feature Selection (FS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have emerged as promising solutions in such scenarios. This paper proposes MICS-EFS, a Model Input-Output Configuration Search with Embedded Feature Selection. The methodology explores internal dependencies in the complete input parameter space for classification tasks involving both 1D sensor time-series and 2D image data. MICS-EFS employs a modified encoder-decoder model and the Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm, combining input-output configuration search with embedded feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MICS-EFS compared to other FS algorithms. Across all tested datasets, MICS-EFS delivered an average accuracy improvement of 1.5% over baseline models, with the accuracy gains ranging from 0.5% to 5.9%. Moreover, the algorithm reduced feature dimensionality to just 2-5% of the original data, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results highlight the potential of MICS-EFS to improve model accuracy and efficiency in various machine learning tasks. Furthermore, the proposed method has been validated in a real-world industrial application focused on machining processes, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality in addressing complex input-output challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 19 figures + appendix, the related software code can be found under the link: https://github.com/viharoszsolt/IDENAS</p></details> |

Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

To resolve this, we propose FlowTS, an ODE-based model that leverages rectified flow with straight-line transport in probability space. By learning geodesic paths between distributions, FlowTS achieves computational efficiency through exact linear trajectory simulation, accelerating training and generation while improving performances. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy inspired by the exploration-exploitation trade-off, balancing noise adaptation and precision. Notably, FlowTS enables seamless adaptation from unconditional to conditional generation without retraining, ensuring efficient real-world deployment. Also, to enhance generation authenticity, FlowTS integrates trend and seasonality decomposition, attention registers (for global context aggregation), and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (for position information). For unconditional setting, extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with context FID scores of 0.019 and 0.011 on Stock and ETTh datasets (prev. best: 0.067, 0.061). For conditional setting, we have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting (MSE 213, prev. best: 375) and MuJoCo imputation tasks (MSE 7e-5, prev. best 2.7e-4).

| **[Impact of Stricter Content Moderation on Parler's Users' Discourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08844v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms employ various content moderation techniques to remove harmful, offensive, and hate speech content. The moderation level varies across platforms; even over time, it can evolve in a platform. For example, Parler, a fringe social media platform popular among conservative users, was known to have the least restrictive moderation policies, claiming to have open discussion spaces for their users. However, after linking the 2021 US Capitol Riots and the activity of some groups on Parler, such as QAnon and Proud Boys, on January 12, 2021, Parler was removed from the Apple and Google App Store and suspended from Amazon Cloud hosting service. Parler would have to modify their moderation policies to return to these online stores. After a month of downtime, Parler was back online with a new set of user guidelines, which reflected stricter content moderation, especially regarding the \emph{hate speech} policy. In this paper, we studied the moderation changes performed by Parler and their effect on the toxicity of its content. We collected a large longitudinal Parler dataset with 17M parleys from 432K active users from February 2021 to January 2022, after its return to the Internet and App Store. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effectiveness of content moderation techniques using data-driven approaches and also the first Parler dataset after its brief hiatus. Our quasi-experimental time series analysis indicates that after the change in Parler's moderation, the severe forms of toxicity (above a threshold of 0.5) immediately decreased and sustained. In contrast, the trend did not change for less severe threats and insults (a threshold between 0.5 - 0.7). Finally, we found an increase in the factuality of the news sites being shared, as well as a decrease in the number of conspiracy or pseudoscience sources being shared.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at The Web Conference 2025 (WWW 2025), please cite accordingly</p></details> |

Unlike regular time series, which assume values at evenly spaced time points, asynchronous time series consist of timestamped events occurring at irregular intervals, each described in natural language. Our approach effectively utilizes the rich natural language of event descriptions, allowing LLMs to benefit from their broad world knowledge for reasoning across different domains and tasks. This allows us to extend the scope of asynchronous time series analysis beyond forecasting to include tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation. We further introduce Stochastic Soft Prompting, a novel prompt-tuning mechanism that significantly improves model performance, outperforming existing fine-tuning methods such as QLoRA. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and datasets.</p></details> |  |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we present FireCastNet, a novel architecture which combines a 3D convolutional encoder with GraphCast, originally developed for global short-term weather forecasting using graph neural networks. FireCastNet is trained to capture the context leading to wildfires, at different spatial and temporal scales. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of our model in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in time series tasks, current approaches often rely on numerical data alone, overlooking the multimodal nature of time-dependent information, such as textual descriptions, visual data, and audio signals. Moreover, these methods underutilize LLMs' reasoning capabilities, limiting the analysis to surface-level interpretations instead of deeper temporal and multimodal reasoning. In this position paper, we argue that multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can enable more powerful and flexible reasoning for time series analysis, enhancing decision-making and real-world applications. We call on researchers and practitioners to leverage this potential by developing strategies that prioritize trust, interpretability, and robust reasoning in MLLMs. Lastly, we highlight key research directions, including novel reasoning paradigms, architectural innovations, and domain-specific applications, to advance time series reasoning with MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub.

| **[Stream-level flow matching with Gaussian processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20423v5)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). Conditional flow matching (CFM) exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-squares regression to the conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. In this paper, we extend the CFM algorithm by defining conditional probability paths along ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect data pairs of source and target, which are modeled with Gaussian process (GP) distributions. The unique distributional properties of GPs help preserve the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training. We show that this generalization of the CFM can effectively reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple correlated training data points (e.g., time series). We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to image and neural time series data.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on manufacturing time series data from a German automotive supply industry. We utilize autoencoders to compress the entire time series and then apply anomaly detection techniques to its latent features. For outlier interpretation, we (i) adopt widely used XAI techniques to the autoencoder's encoder. Additionally, (ii) we propose AEE, Aggregated Explanatory Ensemble, a novel approach that fuses explanations of multiple XAI techniques into a single, more expressive interpretation. For evaluation of explanations, (iii) we propose a technique to measure the quality of encoder explanations quantitatively. Furthermore, we qualitatively assess the effectiveness of outlier explanations with domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted at TempXAI @ ECML-PKDD, published in CEUR Workshop Proceedings, Vol. 3761. https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3761/paper3.pdf</p></details> |

However, population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate change, notably the influence of temperatures on mortality. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected mortality using a multi-population mortality model. This method combines a stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model, predicting mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations, be it excesses or insufficiencies. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional mortality models. We illustrate this proposed mortality model using French data stratified by gender, focusing on past temperatures and mortality. Utilizing climate model predictions across various IPCC scenarios, we investigate gains and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality induced by extreme heatwaves, and quantify them by assessing this new risk factor in prediction intervals. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical differences across the Metropolitan France.</p></details> |  |

By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regressions under Adverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13327v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new regression method that relates the mean of an outcome variable to covariates, under the "adverse condition" that a distress variable falls in its tail. This allows to tailor classical mean regressions to adverse scenarios, which receive increasing interest in economics and finance, among many others. In the terminology of the systemic risk literature, our method can be interpreted as a regression for the Marginal Expected Shortfall. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the new models, show consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator, and propose feasible inference under weak conditions that allow for cross-sectional and time series applications. Simulations verify the accuracy of the asymptotic approximations of the two-step estimator. Two empirical applications show that our regressions under adverse conditions are a valuable tool in such diverse fields as the study of the relation between systemic risk and asset price bubbles, and dissecting macroeconomic growth vulnerabilities into individual components.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks, allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the use of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during training. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks using time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal multiclass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as various fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025), https://openreview.net/forum?id=BhOJreYmur&noteId=ymnAhncuez</p></details> |

However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlying the model, we can show its universality and generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations. In this sense, the proposed model establishes a new connection between Koopman operators and numerical linear algebraic methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we develop novel inference procedures for the spectral density matrix in the high-dimensional setting. Specifically, we introduce a new global testing procedure to test the nullity of the cross-spectral density for a given set of frequencies and across pairs of component indices. For the first time, both Gaussian approximation and parametric bootstrap methodologies are employed to conduct inference for a high-dimensional parameter formulated in the frequency domain, and new technical tools are developed to provide asymptotic guarantees of the size accuracy and power for global testing. We further propose a multiple testing procedure for simultaneously testing the nullity of the cross-spectral density at a given set of frequencies. The method is shown to control the false discovery rate. Both numerical simulations and a real data illustration demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed testing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[tidychangepoint: a unified framework for analyzing changepoint detection in univariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14369v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present tidychangepoint, a new R package for changepoint detection analysis. Most R packages for segmenting univariate time series focus on providing one or two algorithms for changepoint detection that work with a small set of models and penalized objective functions, and all of them return a custom, nonstandard object type. This makes comparing results across various algorithms, models, and penalized objective functions unnecessarily difficult. tidychangepoint solves this problem by wrapping functions from a variety of existing packages and storing the results in a common S3 class called tidycpt. The package then provides functionality for easily extracting comparable numeric or graphical information from a tidycpt object, all in a tidyverse-compliant framework. tidychangepoint is versatile: it supports both deterministic algorithms like PELT (from changepoint), and also flexible, randomized, genetic algorithms (via GA) that -- via new functionality built into tidychangepoint -- can be used with any compliant model-fitting function and any penalized objective function. By bringing all of these disparate tools together in a cohesive fashion, tidychangepoint facilitates comparative analysis of changepoint detection algorithms and models.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional MLP-based neural networks that are often criticized for their black-box nature, KAN offers an interpretable approach via learnable spline-based activation functions and symbolification. Based on a parsimonious architecture with symbolic functions, KAN expresses a forecast of the VIX as a closed-form in terms of explanatory variables, and provide interpretable insights into key characteristics of the VIX, including mean reversion and the leverage effect. Through in-depth empirical analysis across multiple datasets and periods, we show that KANs achieve competitive forecasting performance while requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to MLP-based neural network models. Our findings demonstrate the capacity and potential of KAN as an interpretable financial time-series forecasting method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Information Decomposition as a Tool to Quantify Emergent Dynamical Behaviors In Physiological Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00945v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: This work introduces a framework for multivariate time series analysis aimed at detecting and quantifying collective emerging behaviors in the dynamics of physiological networks. Methods: Given a network system mapped by a vector random process, we compute the predictive information (PI) between the present and past network states and dissect it into amounts quantifying the unique, redundant and synergistic information shared by the present of the network and the past of each unit. Emergence is then quantified as the prevalence of the synergistic over the redundant contribution. The framework is implemented in practice using vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Results: Validation in simulated VAR processes documents that emerging behaviors arise in networks where multiple causal interactions coexist with internal dynamics. The application to cardiovascular and respiratory networks mapping the beat-to-beat variability of heart rate, arterial pressure and respiration measured at rest and during postural stress reveals the presence of statistically significant net synergy, as well as its modulation with sympathetic nervous system activation. Conclusion: Causal emergence can be efficiently assessed decomposing the PI of network systems via VAR models applied to multivariate time series. This approach evidences the synergy/redundancy balance as a hallmark of integrated short-term autonomic control in cardiovascular and respiratory networks. Significance: Measures of causal emergence provide a practical tool to quantify the mechanisms of causal influence that determine the dynamic state of cardiovascular and neural network systems across distinct physiopathological conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Estimation of State Space Models Using Particle Importance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00904v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models have been used in many applications, including econometrics, engineering, medical research, etc. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the static parameter of general state-space models is not straightforward because the likelihood function is intractable. It is popular to use the sequential Monte Carlo(SMC) method to perform gradient ascent optimisation in either offline or online fashion. One problem with existing online SMC methods for MLE is that the score estimators are inconsistent, i.e. the bias does not vanish with increasing particle size. In this paper, two SMC algorithms are proposed based on an importance sampling weight function to use each set of generated particles more efficiently. The first one is an offline algorithm that locally approximates the likelihood function using importance sampling, where the locality is adapted by the effective sample size (ESS). The second one is a semi-online algorithm that has a computational cost linear in the particle size and uses score estimators that are consistent. We study its consistency and asymptotic normality. Their computational superiority is illustrated in numerical studies for long time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AISTATS2025</p></details> |

Conformal inference provides a pivotal and flexible instrument for assessing the uncertainty of machine learning models through prediction sets. Recently, a series of online conformal inference methods updated thresholds of prediction sets by performing online gradient descent on a sequence of quantile loss functions. A drawback of such methods is that they only use the information of revealed non-conformity scores via miscoverage indicators but ignore error quantification, namely the distance between the non-conformity score and the current threshold. To accurately leverage the dynamic of miscoverage error, we propose \textit{Error-quantified Conformal Inference} (ECI) by smoothing the quantile loss function. ECI introduces a continuous and adaptive feedback scale with the miscoverage error, rather than simple binary feedback in existing methods. We establish a long-term coverage guarantee for ECI under arbitrary dependence and distribution shift. The extensive experimental results show that ECI can achieve valid miscoverage control and output tighter prediction sets than other baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera version</p></details> |

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our model is pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving flexibility in representation learning beyond using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with 1 trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse through TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which exhibit unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance on zero-shot forecasting. In addition to presenting good scaling behavior, Sundial achieves new state-of-the-art on both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative paradigm will facilitate a wide variety of forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Role of Mixup in Topological Persistence Based Knowledge Distillation for Wearable Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00779v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of wearable sensor data has enabled many successes in several applications. To represent the high-sampling rate time-series with sufficient detail, the use of topological data analysis (TDA) has been considered, and it is found that TDA can complement other time-series features. Nonetheless, due to the large time consumption and high computational resource requirements of extracting topological features through TDA, it is difficult to deploy topological knowledge in various applications. To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) can be adopted, which is a technique facilitating model compression and transfer learning to generate a smaller model by transferring knowledge from a larger network. By leveraging multiple teachers in KD, both time-series and topological features can be transferred, and finally, a superior student using only time-series data is distilled. On the other hand, mixup has been popularly used as a robust data augmentation technique to enhance model performance during training. Mixup and KD employ similar learning strategies. In KD, the student model learns from the smoothed distribution generated by the teacher model, while mixup creates smoothed labels by blending two labels. Hence, this common smoothness serves as the connecting link that establishes a connection between these two methods. In this paper, we analyze the role of mixup in KD with time-series as well as topological persistence, employing multiple teachers. We present a comprehensive analysis of various methods in KD and mixup on wearable sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Sensors Journal (2024)</p></details> |

This motivates us to develop the online generalized method of moments (OGMM), an explicitly updated estimation and inference framework in the time series setting. The OGMM inherits many properties of offline GMM, such as its broad applicability to many problems in econometrics and statistics, natural accommodation for over-identification, and achievement of semiparametric efficiency under temporal dependence. As an online method, the key gain relative to offline GMM is the vast improvement in time complexity and memory requirement. Building on the OGMM framework, we propose improved versions of online Sargan--Hansen and structural stability tests following recent work in econometrics and statistics. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we observe encouraging finite-sample performance in online instrumental variables regression, online over-identifying restrictions test, online quantile regression, and online anomaly detection. Interesting applications of OGMM to stochastic volatility modelling and inertial sensor calibration are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of OGMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (26 main), 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily focus on data poisoning during the training phase, designing sophisticated triggers to improve stealthiness and attack success rate (ASR). However, in practical scenarios, attackers often face restrictions in accessing training data. Moreover, it is a challenge for the model to maintain generalization ability on clean test data while remaining vulnerable to poisoned inputs when data is inaccessible. To address these challenges, we propose TrojanTime, a novel two-step training algorithm. In the first stage, we generate a pseudo-dataset using an external arbitrary dataset through target adversarial attacks. The clean model is then continually trained on this pseudo-dataset and its poisoned version. To ensure generalization ability, the second stage employs a carefully designed training strategy, combining logits alignment and batch norm freezing. We evaluate TrojanTime using five types of triggers across four TSC architectures in UCR benchmark datasets from diverse domains. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrojanTime in executing backdoor attacks while maintaining clean accuracy. Finally, to mitigate this threat, we propose a defensive unlearning strategy that effectively reduces the ASR while preserving clean accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel framework, FGATT, that combines the Fuzzy Graph Attention Network (FGAT) with the Transformer encoder to perform robust and accurate data imputation. FGAT leverages fuzzy rough sets and graph attention mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies dynamically, even in scenarios where predefined spatial information is unavailable. The Transformer encoder is employed to model temporal dependencies, utilizing its self-attention mechanism to focus on significant time-series patterns. A self-adaptive graph construction method is introduced to enable dynamic connectivity learning, ensuring the framework's applicability to a wide range of wireless datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with substantial missing data. The proposed model is well-suited for applications in wireless sensor networks and IoT environments, where data integrity is critical.</p></details> | Accepted to ISMSI'25 |

Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Binned Spectral Power Loss for Improved Prediction of Chaotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00472v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting multiscale chaotic dynamical systems with deep learning remains a formidable challenge due to the spectral bias of neural networks, which hinders the accurate representation of fine-scale structures in long-term predictions. This issue is exacerbated when models are deployed autoregressively, leading to compounding errors and instability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate the spectral bias which we call the Binned Spectral Power (BSP) Loss. The BSP loss is a frequency-domain loss function that adaptively weighs errors in predicting both larger and smaller scales of the dataset. Unlike traditional losses that focus on pointwise misfits, our BSP loss explicitly penalizes deviations in the energy distribution across different scales, promoting stable and physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that the BSP loss mitigates the well-known problem of spectral bias in deep learning. We further validate our approach for the data-driven high-dimensional time-series forecasting of a range of benchmark chaotic systems which are typically intractable due to spectral bias. Our results demonstrate that the BSP loss significantly improves the stability and spectral accuracy of neural forecasting models without requiring architectural modifications. By directly targeting spectral consistency, our approach paves the way for more robust deep learning models for long-term forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the asymptotic behavior of hyperbolic curves, the proposed schedulers maintain more stable learning curves across varying epoch settings. Specifically, HyperbolicLR applies this property directly in the epoch-learning rate space, while ExpHyperbolicLR extends it to an exponential space. We first determine optimal hyperparameters for each scheduler on a small number of epochs, fix these hyperparameters, and then evaluate performance as the number of epochs increases. Experimental results on various deep learning tasks (e.g., image classification, time series forecasting, and operator learning) demonstrate that both HyperbolicLR and ExpHyperbolicLR achieve more consistent performance improvements than conventional schedulers as training duration grows. These findings suggest that our hyperbolic-based schedulers offer a more robust and efficient approach to deep network optimization, particularly in scenarios constrained by computational resources or time.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency across time. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</p></details> |  |

This analysis is performed on both the conserved and non-conserved cases of the 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators. For the 1D oscillator, constants are found in the cases where the system is underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. The novel existence of such a constant for a non-conserved model is interpreted as a manifestation of the conservation of energy of the {\em total} system (i.e., oscillator plus dissipative environment). For the 2D oscillator, constants are found for the isotropic and anisotropic cases, including when the frequencies are incommensurate; it is also generalized to arbitrary dimensions. In addition, a constant is identified which generalizes angular momentum for all ratios of the frequencies. The approach presented here can produce {\em multiple} constants of motion from a {\em single}, generic data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

This paper introduces KoopAGRU, a new deep learning model designed to tackle this problem by combining Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Deep Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DeepDMD), and Koopman theory. FFT allows KoopAGRU to decompose temporal data into time-variant and time-invariant components providing precise modeling of complex patterns. To better control these two components, KoopAGRU utilizes Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) encoders to learn Koopman observables, enhancing the detection capability across multiple temporal scales. KoopAGRU is trained in a single process and offers fast inference times. Extensive tests on various benchmark datasets show that KoopAGRU outperforms other leading methods, achieving a new average F1-score of 90.88\% on the well-known anomalies detection task of times series datasets, and proves to be efficient and reliable in detecting anomalies in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Extension of the Iterated Moving Average](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00128v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an extension of the iterated moving average filter, called the Extended Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (EKZ) filter for time series and spatio-temporal analysis. The iterated application of a central simple moving average (SMA) filter, also known as a Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter, is a low-pass filter defined by the length of the moving average window and the number of iterations. These two arguments determine the filter properties such as the energy transfer function and cut-off frequency. However, the existing KZ filter is only defined for positive odd integer widow lengths. Therefore, for any finite time series dataset there is only a relatively small selection of possible window lengths, determined by the length of the dataset, with which to apply a KZ filter. This inflexibility impedes use of KZ filters for a wide variety of applications such as time series component separation, filtration, signal reconstruction, energy transfer function design, modeling, and forecasting. The proposed EKZ filter extends the KZ and SMA filters by permitting a widened range of argument selection for the filter window length providing the choice of an infinite number of filters that may be applied to a dataset, affording enhanced control over the filter characteristics and greater practical application. Simulations and real data application examples are provided.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Concept drift -- characterized by the evolving statistical properties of time series data, affects the reliability and accuracy of conventional analysis models. This is particularly evident in co-evolving scenarios where interactions among variables are crucial. This paper presents CORAL, a simple yet effective method that models time series as an evolving ecosystem to learn representations of concept drift. CORAL employs a kernel-induced self-representation learning to generate a representation matrix, encapsulating the inherent dynamics of co-evolving time series. This matrix serves as a key tool for identification and adaptation to concept drift by observing its temporal variations. Furthermore, CORAL effectively identifies prevailing patterns and offers insights into emerging trends through pattern evolution analysis. Our empirical evaluation of CORAL across various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in handling the complexities of concept drift. This approach introduces a novel perspective in the theoretical domain of co-evolving time series analysis, enhancing adaptability and accuracy in the face of dynamic data environments, and can be easily integrated into most deep learning backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Global Carbon Budget as a cointegrated system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09226v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Global Carbon Budget, maintained by the Global Carbon Project, summarizes Earth's global carbon cycle through four annual time series beginning in 1959: atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions, and CO$_2$ uptake by land and ocean. We analyze these four time series as a multivariate (cointegrated) system. Statistical tests show that the four time series are cointegrated with rank three and identify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions as the single stochastic trend driving the nonstationary dynamics of the system. The three cointegrated relations correspond to the physical relations that the sinks are linearly related to atmospheric concentrations and that the change in concentrations equals emissions minus the combined uptake by land and ocean. Furthermore, likelihood ratio tests show that a parametrically restricted error-correction model that embodies these physical relations and accounts for the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation cannot be rejected on the data. The model can be used for both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. In an application of the latter, we demonstrate that projections based on this model, using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios, yield results consistent with established climate science.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses.

| **[FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02675v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable successes of general-purpose neural networks, such as MLPs and Transformers, we find that they exhibit notable shortcomings in modeling and reasoning about periodic phenomena, achieving only marginal performance within the training domain and failing to generalize effectively to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that offers broad applicability similar to MLP while effectively addressing periodicity modeling challenges. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach maintains the general-purpose modeling capability. Therefore, FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various model architectures with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, e.g., symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, language modeling, and image recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalisable Time Series Understanding Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07299v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision, driven by efficient pre-training on large datasets, have enabled foundation models to excel on a wide range of tasks. However, this potential has not yet been fully realised in time series analysis, as existing methods fail to address the heterogeneity in large time series corpora. Prevalent in domains ranging from medicine to finance, time series vary substantially in characteristics such as variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal patterns, and sampling frequency. To address this, we introduce a novel pre-training paradigm specifically designed to handle time series heterogeneity. We propose a tokeniser with learnable domain signatures, a dual masking strategy, and a normalised cross-correlation loss, enabling our open model for general time series analysis (OTiS) to efficiently learn from large time series corpora. Extensive benchmarking on diverse tasks, such as classification, regression, and forecasting, demonstrates that OTiS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/oetu/otis.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEAT: Balanced Frequency Adaptive Tuning for Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19065v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is crucial for numerous real-world applications including weather prediction and financial market modeling. While temporal-domain methods remain prevalent, frequency-domain approaches can effectively capture multi-scale periodic patterns, reduce sequence dependencies, and naturally denoise signals. However, existing approaches typically train model components for all frequencies under a unified training objective, often leading to mismatched learning speeds: high-frequency components converge faster and risk overfitting, while low-frequency components underfit due to insufficient training time. To deal with this challenge, we propose BEAT (Balanced frEquency Adaptive Tuning), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the training status for each frequency and adaptively adjusts their gradient updates. By recognizing convergence, overfitting, or underfitting for each frequency, BEAT dynamically reallocates learning priorities, moderating gradients for rapid learners and increasing those for slower ones, alleviating the tension between competing objectives across frequencies and synchronizing the overall learning process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Text-Image Time Series Retrieval in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19043v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing research interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time series (i.e., the query time series), the ITSR methods search and retrieve from large archives the image time series that have similar content to the query time series. The existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval problems, limiting their usability and versatility. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we introduce the task of cross-modal text-ITSR. In particular, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR) method that enables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and vice versa. In detail, we focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e., bitemporal images). The proposed text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1) modality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images and text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific projection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared embedding space. To effectively model the temporal information within the bitemporal images, we introduce two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion (GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective operators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that leverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant bitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal image). The code of this work is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/cross-modal-text-tsir.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extreme Value Modelling of Feature Residuals for Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05687v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in a temporal sequence of graphs can be applied is areas such as the detection of accidents in transport networks and cyber attacks in computer networks. Existing methods for detecting abnormal graphs can suffer from multiple limitations, such as high false positive rates as well as difficulties with handling variable-sized graphs and non-trivial temporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a technique where temporal dependencies are explicitly modelled via time series analysis of a large set of pertinent graph features, followed by using residuals to remove the dependencies. Extreme Value Theory is then used to robustly model and classify any remaining extremes, aiming to produce low false positives rates. Comparative evaluations on a multitude of graph instances show that the proposed approach obtains considerably better accuracy than TensorSplat and Laplacian Anomaly Detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended and revised version of arXiv:2210.07407</p></details> |
| **[Neural SDEs as a Unified Approach to Continuous-Domain Sequence Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18871v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the ubiquitous use of differential equations to model continuous dynamics across diverse scientific and engineering domains, we propose a novel and intuitive approach to continuous sequence modeling. Our method interprets time-series data as \textit{discrete samples from an underlying continuous dynamical system}, and models its time evolution using Neural Stochastic Differential Equation (Neural SDE), where both the flow (drift) and diffusion terms are parameterized by neural networks. We derive a principled maximum likelihood objective and a \textit{simulation-free} scheme for efficient training of our Neural SDE model. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through experiments on sequence modeling tasks across both embodied and generative AI. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show that SDE-based continuous-time modeling also excels in such complex scenarios, and we hope that our work opens up new avenues for research of SDE models in high-dimensional and temporally intricate domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Clustering Approaches for Smart Meter Time Series: Investigating the Influence of Dataset Properties on Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02026v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of smart meters for monitoring energy consumption has generated vast quantities of high-resolution time series data which remains underutilised. While clustering has emerged as a fundamental tool for mining smart meter time series (SMTS) data, selecting appropriate clustering methods remains challenging despite numerous comparative studies. These studies often rely on problematic methodologies and consider a limited scope of methods, frequently overlooking compelling methods from the broader time series clustering literature. Consequently, they struggle to provide dependable guidance for practitioners designing their own clustering approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative framework for SMTS clustering methods using expert-informed synthetic datasets that emphasise peak consumption behaviours as fundamental cluster concepts. Using a phased methodology, we first evaluated 31 distance measures and 8 representation methods using leave-one-out classification, then examined the better-suited methods in combination with 11 clustering algorithms. We further assessed the robustness of these combinations to systematic changes in key dataset properties that affect clustering performance on real-world datasets, including cluster balance, noise, and the presence of outliers. Our results revealed that methods accommodating local temporal shifts while maintaining amplitude sensitivity, particularly Dynamic Time Warping and $k$-sliding distance, consistently outperformed traditional approaches. Among other key findings, we identified that when combined with hierarchical clustering using Ward's linkage, these methods demonstrated consistent robustness across varying dataset characteristics without careful parameter tuning. These and other findings inform actionable recommendations for practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Existing channel-dependent models, where Transformer-based models dominate, process these dependencies separately, limiting their capacity to capture complex interactions such as lead-lag dynamics. To address this issue, we propose TiVaT (Time-variate Transformer), a novel architecture incorporating a single unified module, a Joint-Axis (JA) attention module, that concurrently processes temporal and variate modeling. The JA attention module dynamically selects relevant features to particularly capture asynchronous interactions. In addition, we introduce distance-aware time-variate sampling in the JA attention, a novel mechanism that extracts significant patterns through a learned 2D embedding space while reducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate TiVaT's overall performance across diverse datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with intricate asynchronous dependencies.</p></details> | 15pages |

| **[Neuro-Symbolic AI for Analytical Solutions of Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01476v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analytical solutions of differential equations offer exact insights into fundamental behaviors of physical processes. Their application, however, is limited as finding these solutions is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we combine two key insights. First, constructing an analytical solution requires a composition of foundational solution components. Second, iterative solvers define parameterized function spaces with constraint-based updates. Our approach merges compositional differential equation solution techniques with iterative refinement by using formal grammars, building a rich space of candidate solutions that are embedded into a low-dimensional (continuous) latent manifold for probabilistic exploration. This integration unifies numerical and symbolic differential equation solvers via a neuro-symbolic AI framework to find analytical solutions of a wide variety of differential equations. By systematically constructing candidate expressions and applying constraint-based refinement, we overcome longstanding barriers to extract such closed-form solutions. We illustrate advantages over commercial solvers, symbolic methods, and approximate neural networks on a diverse set of problems, demonstrating both generality and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Neuro-Photonix: Enabling Near-Sensor Neuro-Symbolic AI Computing on Silicon Photonics Substrate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10187v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, blending neural networks with symbolic AI, have facilitated transparent reasoning and context understanding without the need for explicit rule-based programming. However, implementing such models in the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes presents hurdles due to computational constraints and intricacies. In this work, for the first time, we propose a near-sensor neuro-symbolic AI computing accelerator named Neuro-Photonix for vision applications. Neuro-photonix processes neural dynamic computations on analog data while inherently supporting granularity-controllable convolution operations through the efficient use of photonic devices. Additionally, the creation of an innovative, low-cost ADC that works seamlessly with photonic technology removes the necessity for costly ADCs. Moreover, Neuro-Photonix facilitates the generation of HyperDimensional (HD) vectors for HD-based symbolic AI computing. This approach allows the proposed design to substantially diminish the energy consumption and latency of conversion, transmission, and processing within the established cloud-centric architecture and recently designed accelerators. Our device-to-architecture results show that Neuro-Photonix achieves 30 GOPS/W and reduces power consumption by a factor of 20.8 and 4.1 on average on neural dynamics compared to ASIC baselines and photonic accelerators while preserving accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Semantic Framework for Neuro-Symbolic Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12050v5)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of neuro-symbolic AI aims to benefit from the combination of neural networks and symbolic systems. A cornerstone of the field is the translation or encoding of symbolic knowledge into neural networks. Although many neuro-symbolic methods and approaches have been proposed, and with a large increase in recent years, no common definition of encoding exists that can enable a precise, theoretical comparison of neuro-symbolic methods. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a semantic framework for neuro-symbolic AI. We start by providing a formal definition of semantic encoding, specifying the components and conditions under which a knowledge-base can be encoded correctly by a neural network. We then show that many neuro-symbolic approaches are accounted for by this definition. We provide a number of examples and correspondence proofs applying the proposed framework to the neural encoding of various forms of knowledge representation. Many, at first sight disparate, neuro-symbolic methods, are shown to fall within the proposed formalization. This is expected to provide guidance to future neuro-symbolic encodings by placing them in the broader context of semantic encodings of entire families of existing neuro-symbolic systems. The paper hopes to help initiate a discussion around the provision of a theory for neuro-symbolic AI and a semantics for deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Generalisation Between Humans and Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15626v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI -- including generative approaches -- have resulted in technology that can support humans in scientific discovery and decision support but may also disrupt democracies and target individuals. The responsible use of AI increasingly shows the need for human-AI teaming, necessitating effective interaction between humans and machines. A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of these interactions is the different ways in which humans and machines generalise. In cognitive science, human generalisation commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. In contrast, AI generalisation encompasses out-of-domain generalisation in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neuro-symbolic AI. In this perspective paper, we combine insights from AI and cognitive science to identify key commonalities and differences across three dimensions: notions of generalisation, methods for generalisation, and evaluation of generalisation. We map the different conceptualisations of generalisation in AI and cognitive science along these three dimensions and consider their role in human-AI teaming. This results in interdisciplinary challenges across AI and cognitive science that must be tackled to provide a foundation for effective and cognitively supported alignment in human-AI teaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks, were not designed to capture more than a few of these aspects. Whereas deep learning datasets focus on visually complex data but simple visual reasoning tasks, inductive logic datasets involve complex logical learning tasks, however, lack the visual component. To address this, we propose the diagnostic visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Train, - a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL-Train provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even SOTA AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations of each methodology. Overall, V-LoL opens up new avenues for understanding and enhancing current abilities in visual logical learning for AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap: Representation Spaces in Neuro-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04393v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic AI is an effective method for improving the overall performance of AI models by combining the advantages of neural networks and symbolic learning. However, there are differences between the two in terms of how they process data, primarily because they often use different data representation methods, which is often an important factor limiting the overall performance of the two. From this perspective, we analyzed 191 studies from 2013 by constructing a four-level classification framework. The first level defines five types of representation spaces, and the second level focuses on five types of information modalities that the representation space can represent. Then, the third level describes four symbolic logic methods. Finally, the fourth-level categories propose three collaboration strategies between neural networks and symbolic learning. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of 46 research based on their representation space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic AI: Explainability, Challenges, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04383v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is an essential reason limiting the application of neural networks in many vital fields. Although neuro-symbolic AI hopes to enhance the overall explainability by leveraging the transparency of symbolic learning, the results are less evident than imagined. This article proposes a classification for explainability by considering both model design and behavior of 191 studies from 2013, focusing on neuro-symbolic AI, hoping to inspire scholars who want to understand the explainability of neuro-symbolic AI. Precisely, we classify them into five categories by considering whether the form of bridging the representation differences is readable as their design factor, if there are representation differences between neural networks and symbolic logic learning, and whether a model decision or prediction process is understandable as their behavior factor: implicit intermediate representations and implicit prediction, partially explicit intermediate representations and partially explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representations or explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representation and explicit prediction, unified representation and explicit prediction. We also analyzed the research trends and three significant challenges: unified representations, explainability and transparency, and sufficient cooperation from neural networks and symbolic learning. Finally, we put forward suggestions for future research in three aspects: unified representations, enhancing model explainability, ethical considerations, and social impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00773v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI. All the code and data are open-sourced at our website.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

The motivation is that the strengths of either area match the weaknesses of the other, and $\unicode{x2013}$ by combining the two $\unicode{x2013}$ the weaknesses of either method can be limited. Neuro-symbolic AI focuses on this integration where the statistical methods are in particular neural networks. In recent years, there has been significant progress in this research field, where neuro-symbolic systems outperformed logical or neural models alone. Yet, neuro-symbolic AI is, comparatively speaking, still in its infancy and has not been widely adopted by machine learning practitioners. In this survey, we present the first mapping of neuro-symbolic techniques into families of frameworks based on their architectures, with several benefits: Firstly, it allows us to link different strengths of frameworks to their respective architectures. Secondly, it allows us to illustrate how engineers can augment their neural networks while treating the symbolic methods as black-boxes. Thirdly, it allows us to map most of the field so that future researchers can identify closely related frameworks.</p></details> | 57 pages |

The growing need to produce and maintain increasingly complex multi-architecture applications makes it crucial to effectively accelerate and automate software engineering processes. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are expected to work hand-in-hand with human developers. Therefore, it becomes critical to model the software accurately, so that the AI and humans can share a common understanding of the problem. In this contribution, firstly, an in-depth overview of these interconnected challenges faced by modern software engineering is presented. Secondly, to tackle them, a novel architecture based on the emerging WebAssembly technology and the latest advancements in neuro-symbolic AI, autonomy, and knowledge graphs is proposed. The presented system architecture is based on the concept of dynamic, knowledge graph-based WebAssembly Twins, which model the software throughout all stages of its lifecycle. The resulting systems are to possess advanced autonomous capabilities, with full transparency and controllability by the end user. The concept takes a leap beyond the current software engineering approaches, addressing some of the most urgent issues in the field. Finally, the efforts towards realizing the proposed approach as well as future research directions are summarized.</p></details> |  |

Comprising a 'neuro' component for feature extraction and a 'symbolic' component for decision-making, neuro-symbolic AI has yet to fully benefit from efficient hardware accelerators. Additionally, current hardware struggles to accommodate applications requiring dynamic resource allocation between these two components. To address these challenges-and mitigate the typical data-transfer bottleneck of classical Von Neumann architectures-we propose a ferroelectric charge-domain compute-in-memory (CiM) array as the foundational processing element for neuro-symbolic AI. This array seamlessly handles both the critical multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations of the 'neuro' workload and the parallel associative search operations of the 'symbolic' workload. To enable this approach, we introduce an innovative 1FeFET-1C cell, combining a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with a capacitor. This design, overcomes the destructive sensing limitations of DRAM in CiM applications, while capable of capitalizing decades of DRAM expertise with a similar cell structure as DRAM, achieves high immunity against FeFET variation-crucial for neuro-symbolic AI-and demonstrates superior energy efficiency. The functionalities of our design have been successfully validated through SPICE simulations and prototype fabrication and testing. Our hardware platform has been benchmarked in executing typical neuro-symbolic AI reasoning tasks, showing over 2x improvement in latency and 1000x improvement in energy efficiency compared to GPU-based implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Explanations for Neuro-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14219v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the practical success of Artificial Intelligence (AI), current neural AI algorithms face two significant issues. First, the decisions made by neural architectures are often prone to bias and brittleness. Second, when a chain of reasoning is required, neural systems often perform poorly. Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is a promising approach that tackles these (and other) weaknesses by combining the power of neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Meanwhile, the success of AI has made it critical to understand its behaviour, leading to the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While neuro-symbolic AI systems have important advantages over purely neural AI, we still need to explain their actions, which are obscured by the interactions of the neural and symbolic components. To address the issue, this paper proposes a formal approach to explaining the decisions of neuro-symbolic systems. The approach hinges on the use of formal abductive explanations and on solving the neuro-symbolic explainability problem hierarchically. Namely, it first computes a formal explanation for the symbolic component of the system, which serves to identify a subset of the individual parts of neural information that needs to be explained. This is followed by explaining only those individual neural inputs, independently of each other, which facilitates succinctness of hierarchical formal explanations and helps to increase the overall performance of the approach. Experimental results for a few complex reasoning tasks demonstrate practical efficiency of the proposed approach, in comparison to purely neural systems, from the perspective of explanation size, explanation time, training time, model sizes, and the quality of explanations reported.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI focuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation, LAAs integrate neuro-symbolic AI principles, showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human-like reasoning processes, scaling effectively with large datasets, and leveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training.

To develop next-generation cognitive AI systems, neuro-symbolic AI emerges as a promising paradigm, fusing neural and symbolic approaches to enhance interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness, while facilitating learning from much less data. Recent neuro-symbolic systems have demonstrated great potential in collaborative human-AI scenarios with reasoning and cognitive capabilities. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics and potential architectures for neuro-symbolic AI. We first systematically categorize neuro-symbolic AI algorithms, and then experimentally evaluate and analyze them in terms of runtime, memory, computational operators, sparsity, and system characteristics on CPUs, GPUs, and edge SoCs. Our studies reveal that neuro-symbolic models suffer from inefficiencies on off-the-shelf hardware, due to the memory-bound nature of vector-symbolic and logical operations, complex flow control, data dependencies, sparsity variations, and limited scalability. Based on profiling insights, we suggest cross-layer optimization solutions and present a hardware acceleration case study for vector-symbolic architecture to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of neuro-symbolic computing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions of neuro-symbolic AI from both system and architectural perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables; IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Artificial Intelligence (TCASAI), 2024</p></details> |

However, high-stakes decision-making tasks in fields such as medical, legal and finance require a level of precision, comprehensiveness, and logical consistency that pure LLM or Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) approaches often fail to deliver. At Elemental Cognition (EC), we have developed a neuro-symbolic AI platform to tackle these problems. The platform integrates fine-tuned LLMs for knowledge extraction and alignment with a robust symbolic reasoning engine for logical inference, planning and interactive constraint solving. We describe Cora, a Collaborative Research Assistant built on this platform, that is designed to perform complex research and discovery tasks in high-stakes domains. This paper discusses the multi-step inference challenges inherent in such domains, critiques the limitations of existing LLM-based methods, and demonstrates how Cora's neuro-symbolic approach effectively addresses these issues. We provide an overview of the system architecture, key algorithms for knowledge extraction and formal reasoning, and present preliminary evaluation results that highlight Cora's superior performance compared to well-known LLM and RAG baselines.</p></details> |  |

Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

An elegant approach to represent this intricate factorization is via high-dimensional holographic vectors drawing on brain-inspired vector symbolic architectures. However, holographic factorization involves iterative computation with high-dimensional matrix-vector multiplications and suffers from non-convergence problems. In this paper, we present H3DFact, a heterogeneous 3D integrated in-memory compute engine capable of efficiently factorizing high-dimensional holographic representations. H3DFact exploits the computation-in-superposition capability of holographic vectors and the intrinsic stochasticity associated with memristive-based 3D compute-in-memory. Evaluated on large-scale factorization and perceptual problems, H3DFact demonstrates superior capability in factorization accuracy and operational capacity by up to five orders of magnitude, with 5.5x compute density, 1.2x energy efficiency improvements, and 5.9x less silicon footprint compared to iso-capacity 2D designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE); The first two authors have equal contributions</p></details> |
| **[ContextGPT: Infusing LLMs Knowledge into Neuro-Symbolic Activity Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06586v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a hot research area in mobile computing, and the most effective solutions in the literature are based on supervised deep learning models. However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise. An extensive evaluation carried out on two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.</p></details> |  |

This requires combining heterogeneous data sources such as knowledge graphs, neural model predictions, structured databases, crowd-sourced data, and many more. To allow for such reasoning, we generalise the standard rule-based language Datalog with existential rules (commonly referred to as tuple-generating dependencies) to the fuzzy setting, by allowing for arbitrary t-norms in the place of classical conjunctions in rule bodies. The resulting formalism allows us to perform reasoning about data associated with degrees of uncertainty while preserving computational complexity results and the applicability of reasoning techniques established for the standard Datalog setting. In particular, we provide fuzzy extensions of Datalog chases which produce fuzzy universal models and we exploit them to show that in important fragments of the language, reasoning has the same complexity as in the classical setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) as Universal Foundation Models for AI-Native Wireless Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01748v2)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and foundation models have been recently touted as a game-changer for 6G systems. However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Foundation Models in Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01889v1)** | 2024-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) holds promise to ensure the safe deployment of AI systems, as interpretable symbolic techniques provide formal behaviour guarantees. The challenge is how to effectively integrate neural and symbolic computation, to enable learning and reasoning from raw data. Existing pipelines that train the neural and symbolic components sequentially require extensive labelling, whereas end-to-end approaches are limited in terms of scalability, due to the combinatorial explosion in the symbol grounding problem. In this paper, we leverage the implicit knowledge within foundation models to enhance the performance in NeSy tasks, whilst reducing the amount of data labelling and manual engineering. We introduce a new architecture, called NeSyGPT, which fine-tunes a vision-language foundation model to extract symbolic features from raw data, before learning a highly expressive answer set program to solve a downstream task. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that NeSyGPT has superior accuracy over various baselines, and can scale to complex NeSy tasks. Finally, we highlight the effective use of a large language model to generate the programmatic interface between the neural and symbolic components, significantly reducing the amount of manual engineering required.</p></details> | Pre-print |

A promising direction for achieving this goal is Neuro-Symbolic AI, which aims to combine the interpretability of symbolic techniques with the ability of deep learning to learn from raw data. However, most current approaches require manually engineered symbolic knowledge, and where end-to-end training is considered, such approaches are either restricted to learning definite programs, or are restricted to training binary neural networks. In this paper, we introduce Neuro-Symbolic Inductive Learner (NSIL), an approach that trains a general neural network to extract latent concepts from raw data, whilst learning symbolic knowledge that maps latent concepts to target labels. The novelty of our approach is a method for biasing the learning of symbolic knowledge, based on the in-training performance of both neural and symbolic components. We evaluate NSIL on three problem domains of different complexity, including an NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that NSIL learns expressive knowledge, solves computationally complex problems, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and data efficiency.

This often requires maximizing the likelihood of a symbolic constraint w.r.t the neural network's output distribution. Such output distributions are typically assumed to be fully-factorized. This limits the applicability of neuro-symbolic learning to the more expressive autoregressive distributions, e.g., transformers. Under such distributions, computing the likelihood of even simple constraints is #P-hard. Instead of attempting to enforce the constraint on the entire output distribution, we propose to do so on a random, local approximation thereof. More precisely, we optimize the likelihood of the constraint under a pseudolikelihood-based approximation centered around a model sample. Our approximation is factorized, allowing the reuse of solutions to sub-problems, a main tenet for efficiently computing neuro-symbolic losses. Moreover, it is a local, high-fidelity approximation of the likelihood, exhibiting low entropy and KL-divergence around the model sample. We evaluate our approach on Sudoku and shortest-path prediction cast as autoregressive generation, and observe that we greatly improve upon the base model's ability to predict logically-consistent outputs. We also evaluate on the task of detoxifying large language models. Using a simple constraint disallowing a list of toxic words, we are able to steer the model's outputs away from toxic generations, achieving SoTA detoxification compared to previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated detoxification experiments; moved example toxic generations to Github and added link</p></details> |

| **[Trust, Accountability, and Autonomy in Knowledge Graph-based AI for Self-determination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19503v2)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as fundamental platforms for powering intelligent decision-making and a wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI) services across major corporations such as Google, Walmart, and AirBnb. KGs complement Machine Learning (ML) algorithms by providing data context and semantics, thereby enabling further inference and question-answering capabilities. The integration of KGs with neuronal learning (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) is currently a topic of active research, commonly named neuro-symbolic AI. Despite the numerous benefits that can be accomplished with KG-based AI, its growing ubiquity within online services may result in the loss of self-determination for citizens as a fundamental societal issue. The more we rely on these technologies, which are often centralised, the less citizens will be able to determine their own destinies. To counter this threat, AI regulation, such as the European Union (EU) AI Act, is being proposed in certain regions. The regulation sets what technologists need to do, leading to questions concerning: How can the output of AI systems be trusted? What is needed to ensure that the data fuelling and the inner workings of these artefacts are transparent? How can AI be made accountable for its decision-making? This paper conceptualises the foundational topics and research pillars to support KG-based AI for self-determination. Drawing upon this conceptual framework, challenges and opportunities for citizen self-determination are illustrated and analysed in a real-world scenario. As a result, we propose a research agenda aimed at accomplishing the recommended objectives.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we delve into the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dealing with progressively complex analogies expressed in unstructured text. We discuss analogies at four distinct levels of complexity: lexical analogies, syntactic analogies, semantic analogies, and pragmatic analogies. As the analogies become more complex, they require increasingly extensive, diverse knowledge beyond the textual content, unlikely to be found in the lexical co-occurrence statistics that power LLMs. To address this, we discuss the necessity of employing Neuro-symbolic AI techniques that combine statistical and symbolic AI, informing the representation of unstructured text to highlight and augment relevant content, provide abstraction and guide the mapping process. Our knowledge-informed approach maintains the efficiency of LLMs while preserving the ability to explain analogies for pedagogical applications.</p></details> | 12 pages 3 figures |

In this paper we consider the intensional First Order Logic (IFOL) as a symbolic architecture of modern robots, able to use natural languages to communicate with humans and to reason about their own knowledge with self-reference and abstraction language property. We intend to obtain the grounding of robot's language by experience of how it uses its neuronal architectures and hence by associating this experience with the mining (sense) of non-defined language concepts (particulars/individuals and universals) in PRP (Properties/Relations/Propositions) theory of IFOL.\\ We consider the robot's four-levels knowledge structure: The syntax level of particular natural language (Italian, French, etc..), two universal language levels: its semantic logic structure (based on virtual predicates of FOL and logic connectives), and its corresponding conceptual PRP structure level which universally represents the composite mining of FOL formulae grounded on the last robot's neuro-system level. Finally, we provide the general method how to implement in IFOL (by using the abstracted terms) different kinds of modal logic operators and their deductive axioms: we present a particular example of robots autoepistemic deduction capabilities by introduction of the special temporal $Konow$ predicate and deductive axioms for it: reflexive, positive introspection and distributive axiom.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |

Metadata provides a brief overview of the paper while the Full-body text contains key-insights that can be valuable to fellow researchers. To retrieve metadata and key-insights from scientific papers, knowledge acquisition is a central activity. It consists of gathering, analyzing and organizing knowledge embedded in scientific papers in such a way that it can be used and reused whenever needed. Given the wealth of scientific literature, manual knowledge acquisition is a cumbersome task. Thus, computer-assisted and (semi-)automatic strategies are generally adopted. Our purpose in this research was two fold: curate Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) with papers related to ontology learning and define an approach using ORKG as a computer-assisted tool to organize key-insights extracted from research papers. This approach was used to document the "epidemiological surveillance systems design and implementation" research problem and to prepare the related work of this paper.

We find that a straight-through-estimator, a method introduced to train binary neural networks, could effectively be applied to incorporate logical constraints into neural network learning. More specifically, we design a systematic way to represent discrete logical constraints as a loss function; minimizing this loss using gradient descent via a straight-through-estimator updates the neural network's weights in the direction that the binarized outputs satisfy the logical constraints. The experimental results show that by leveraging GPUs and batch training, this method scales significantly better than existing neuro-symbolic methods that require heavy symbolic computation for computing gradients. Also, we demonstrate that our method applies to different types of neural networks, such as MLP, CNN, and GNN, making them learn with no or fewer labeled data by learning directly from known constraints.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Though results have been impressive, explainability and interpretability of deep learning models are still a challenge. A third wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which includes logic and reasoning, has been described as a way to address these issues. Neuro-symbolic AI is a key component of this integration of logic and reasoning with deep learning. In this work we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called Neuro-Symbolic Question-Answer Program Translator, or NS-QAPT, to address explainability and interpretability for deep learning climate simulation, applied to climate tipping point discovery. The NS-QAPT method includes a bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture that translates between domain-specific questions and executable programs used to direct the climate simulation, acting as a bridge between climate scientists and deep learning models. We show early compelling results of this translation method and introduce a domain-specific language and associated executable programs for a commonly known tipping point, the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).</p></details> |  |

It consists in automatically learning a logical theory from data. The basis for structure learning is mining repeating patterns in the data, known as structural motifs. Finding these patterns reduces the exponential search space and therefore guides the learning of formulas. Despite the importance of motif learning, it is still not well understood. We present the first principled approach for mining structural motifs in lifted graphical models, languages that blend first-order logic with probabilistic models, which uses a stochastic process to measure the similarity of entities in the data. Our first contribution is an algorithm, which depends on two intuitive hyperparameters: one controlling the uncertainty in the entity similarity measure, and one controlling the softness of the resulting rules. Our second contribution is a preprocessing step where we perform hierarchical clustering on the data to reduce the search space to the most relevant data. Our third contribution is to introduce an O(n ln n) (in the size of the entities in the data) algorithm for clustering structurally-related data. We evaluate our approach using standard benchmarks and show that we outperform state-of-the-art structure learning approaches by up to 6% in terms of accuracy and up to 80% in terms of runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI23. 9 pages.

Deep Probabilistic Programming Languages (DPPLs) have been developed for probabilistic logic programming to be carried out via the probability estimations of deep neural networks. However, recent SOTA DPPL approaches allow only for limited conditional probabilistic queries and do not offer the power of true joint probability estimation. In our work, we propose an easy integration of tractable probabilistic inference within a DPPL. To this end, we introduce SLASH, a novel DPPL that consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and a logic program, united via answer set programming (ASP). NPPs are a novel design principle allowing for combining all deep model types and combinations thereof to be represented as a single probabilistic predicate. In this context, we introduce a novel $+/-$ notation for answering various types of probabilistic queries by adjusting the atom notations of a predicate. To scale well, we show how to prune the stochastically insignificant parts of the (ground) program, speeding up reasoning without sacrificing the predictive performance. We evaluate SLASH on a variety of different tasks, including the benchmark task of MNIST addition and Visual Question Answering (VQA).</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |

Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate these issues by infusing knowledge about context information into HAR deep learning classifiers. However, existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR require computationally expensive symbolic reasoners during classification, making them less suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile devices). Additionally, NeSy approaches for context-aware HAR have never been evaluated on in-the-wild datasets, and their generalization capabilities in real-world scenarios are questionable. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on a semantic loss function that infuses knowledge constraints in the HAR model during the training phase, avoiding symbolic reasoning during classification. Our results on scripted and in-the-wild datasets show the impact of different semantic loss functions in outperforming a purely data-driven model. We also compare our solution with existing NeSy methods and analyze each approach's strengths and weaknesses. Our semantic loss remains the only NeSy solution that can be deployed as a single DNN without the need for symbolic reasoning modules, reaching recognition rates close (and better in some cases) to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.</p></details> | ACL 2023 |
| **[Synthesizing a Progression of Subtasks for Block-Based Visual Programming Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17518v1)** | 2023-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based visual programming environments play an increasingly important role in introducing computing concepts to K-12 students. In recent years, they have also gained popularity in neuro-symbolic AI, serving as a benchmark to evaluate general problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. The open-ended and conceptual nature of these visual programming tasks make them challenging, both for state-of-the-art AI agents as well as for novice programmers. A natural approach to providing assistance for problem-solving is breaking down a complex task into a progression of simpler subtasks; however, this is not trivial given that the solution codes are typically nested and have non-linear execution behavior. In this paper, we formalize the problem of synthesizing such a progression for a given reference block-based visual programming task. We propose a novel synthesis algorithm that generates a progression of subtasks that are high-quality, well-spaced in terms of their complexity, and solving this progression leads to solving the reference task. We show the utility of our synthesis algorithm in improving the efficacy of AI agents (in this case, neural program synthesizers) for solving tasks in the Karel programming environment. Then, we conduct a user study to demonstrate that our synthesized progression of subtasks can assist a novice programmer in solving tasks in the Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code-dot-org.</p></details> |  |

In particular, assessing the compliance of a product with the relative schematic is a time-consuming and prone-to-error process. In this paper, we address this problem in a specific industrial scenario. In particular, we define a Neuro-Symbolic approach for automating the compliance verification of the electrical control panels. Our approach is based on the combination of Deep Learning techniques with Answer Set Programming (ASP), and allows for identifying possible anomalies and errors in the final product even when a very limited amount of training data is available. The experiments conducted on a real test case provided by an Italian Company operating in electrical control panel production demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming journal</p></details> |

This is mainly because neural networks are not able to decompose joint representations to obtain distinct objects (the so-called binding problem), while symbolic AI suffers from exhaustive rule searches, among other problems. These two problems are still pronounced in neuro-symbolic AI which aims to combine the best of the two paradigms. Here, we show that the two problems can be addressed with our proposed neuro-vector-symbolic architecture (NVSA) by exploiting its powerful operators on high-dimensional distributed representations that serve as a common language between neural networks and symbolic AI. The efficacy of NVSA is demonstrated by solving the Raven's progressive matrices datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art deep neural network and neuro-symbolic approaches, end-to-end training of NVSA achieves a new record of 87.7% average accuracy in RAVEN, and 88.1% in I-RAVEN datasets. Moreover, compared to the symbolic reasoning within the neuro-symbolic approaches, the probabilistic reasoning of NVSA with less expensive operations on the distributed representations is two orders of magnitude faster. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/neuro-vector-symbolic-architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with additional NVSA end-to-end training, generalization experiments, and PGM experiments</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15566v2)** | 2023-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge about space and time is necessary to solve problems in the physical world: An AI agent situated in the physical world and interacting with objects often needs to reason about positions of and relations between objects; and as soon as the agent plans its actions to solve a task, it needs to consider the temporal aspect (e.g., what actions to perform over time). Spatio-temporal knowledge, however, is required beyond interacting with the physical world, and is also often transferred to the abstract world of concepts through analogies and metaphors (e.g., "a threat that is hanging over our heads"). As spatial and temporal reasoning is ubiquitous, different attempts have been made to integrate this into AI systems. In the area of knowledge representation, spatial and temporal reasoning has been largely limited to modeling objects and relations and developing reasoning methods to verify statements about objects and relations. On the other hand, neural network researchers have tried to teach models to learn spatial relations from data with limited reasoning capabilities. Bridging the gap between these two approaches in a mutually beneficial way could allow us to tackle many complex real-world problems, such as natural language processing, visual question answering, and semantic image segmentation. In this chapter, we view this integration problem from the perspective of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Specifically, we propose a synergy between logical reasoning and machine learning that will be grounded on spatial and temporal knowledge. Describing some successful applications, remaining challenges, and evaluation datasets pertaining to this direction is the main topic of this contribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contribution to the book "A Compendium of Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence", which is to appear in the first half of 2023</p></details> |
| **[Is Neuro-Symbolic AI Meeting its Promise in Natural Language Processing? A Structured Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12205v2)** | 2022-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) assert that combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language, it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on github for further analysis.</p></details> | Survey |

Cognitive Science research provides valuable insights into the richness and complexity of analogical reasoning, together with implementations of expressive analogical reasoners with limited scalability. Modern scalable AI techniques with the potential to reason by analogy have been only applied to the special case of proportional analogy, and not to understanding higher-order analogies. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by: 1) formalizing six dimensions of analogy based on mature insights from Cognitive Science research, 2) annotating a corpus of fables with each of these dimensions, and 3) defining four tasks with increasing complexity that enable scalable evaluation of AI techniques. Experiments with language models and neuro-symbolic AI reasoners on these tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods can be applied to reason by analogy with a limited success, motivating the need for further research towards comprehensive and scalable analogical reasoning by AI. We make all our code and data available.</p></details> |  |

These circuits were initially proposed as "compiled objects," meant to facilitate logical and probabilistic reasoning, as they permit various types of inference to be performed in linear-time and a feed-forward fashion like neural networks. In more recent years, the role of tractable circuits has significantly expanded as they became a computational and semantical backbone for some approaches that aim to integrate knowledge, reasoning and learning. In this article, we review the foundations of tractable circuits and some associated milestones, while focusing on their core properties and techniques that make them particularly useful for the broad aims of neuro-symbolic AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An earlier version of this article appeared in the following edited book.

AI-based detection searches the image space to find the regions of interest based on patterns and features. There is a spectrum of tumor histologies from benign to malignant that can be identified by AI-based classification approaches using image features. The extraction of minable information from images gives way to the field of radiomics and can be explored via explicit (handcrafted/engineered) and deep radiomics frameworks. Radiomics analysis has the potential to be utilized as a noninvasive technique for the accurate characterization of tumors to improve diagnosis and treatment monitoring. This work reviews AI-based techniques, with a special focus on oncological PET and PET/CT imaging, for different detection, classification, and prediction/prognosis tasks. We also discuss needed efforts to enable the translation of AI techniques to routine clinical workflows, and potential improvements and complementary techniques such as the use of natural language processing on electronic health records and neuro-symbolic AI techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLASH: Embracing Probabilistic Circuits into Neural Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03395v4)** | 2021-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of combining the robustness of neural networks and the expressivity of symbolic methods has rekindled the interest in neuro-symbolic AI. Recent advancements in neuro-symbolic AI often consider specifically-tailored architectures consisting of disjoint neural and symbolic components, and thus do not exhibit desired gains that can be achieved by integrating them into a unifying framework. We introduce SLASH -- a novel deep probabilistic programming language (DPPL). At its core, SLASH consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and logical programs which are united via answer set programming. The probability estimates resulting from NPPs act as the binding element between the logical program and raw input data, thereby allowing SLASH to answer task-dependent logical queries. This allows SLASH to elegantly integrate the symbolic and neural components in a unified framework. We evaluate SLASH on the benchmark data of MNIST addition as well as novel tasks for DPPLs such as missing data prediction and set prediction with state-of-the-art performance, thereby showing the effectiveness and generality of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

With the recent success of deep learning, incorporating reasoning with deep learning systems, i.e., neuro-symbolic AI has become a major field of interest. We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Forward Reasoner (NSFR), a new approach for reasoning tasks taking advantage of differentiable forward-chaining using first-order logic. The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus, it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms, and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans, and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Combining Rules and Embeddings via Neuro-Symbolic AI for Knowledge Base Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09566v1)** | 2021-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interest in Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) has led to a plethora of approaches based on reinforcement learning, inductive logic programming and graph embeddings. In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules while being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within rule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying quality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these differences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the non-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few paths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all rule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that learn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of paths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by extending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to superior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in terms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of relation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving our results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.</p></details> |  |

Neuro-symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. They have also been shown to obtain high accuracy with significantly less training data than traditional models. Due to the recency of the field's emergence and relative sparsity of published results, the performance characteristics of these models are not well understood. In this paper, we describe and analyze the performance characteristics of three recent neuro-symbolic models. We find that symbolic models have less potential parallelism than traditional neural models due to complex control flow and low-operational-intensity operations, such as scalar multiplication and tensor addition. However, the neural aspect of computation dominates the symbolic part in cases where they are clearly separable. We also find that data movement poses a potential bottleneck, as it does in many ML workloads.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Recent years have seen large number of publications on such hybrid neuro-symbolic AI systems. That rapidly growing literature is highly diverse and mostly empirical, and is lacking a unifying view of the large variety of these hybrid systems. In this paper we analyse a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems, organised in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems. Our patterns reveal similarities between systems that were not recognised until now. Finally, our design patterns extend and refine Kautz' earlier attempt at categorising neuro-symbolic architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 22 figures, accepted for publication in the International Journal of Applied Intelligence</p></details> |

The reliance on retrieval alone proves insufficient for extracting deep, domain-specific knowledge performing in logical reasoning from specialized corpora. To address this, we introduce sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmentation Generation (PIKE-RAG), focusing on extracting, understanding, and applying specialized knowledge, while constructing coherent rationale to incrementally steer LLMs toward accurate responses. Recognizing the diverse challenges of industrial tasks, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies tasks based on their complexity in knowledge extraction and application, allowing for a systematic evaluation of RAG systems' problem-solving capabilities. This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications. Furthermore, we propose knowledge atomizing and knowledge-aware task decomposition to effectively extract multifaceted knowledge from the data chunks and iteratively construct the rationale based on original query and the accumulated knowledge, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, technique report</p></details> |

Prior researches have primarily focused on enhancing logical reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or data augmentation. However, previous work constructing chain-of-thought rationales concentrates solely on analyzing correct options, neglecting the incorrect alternatives. Addtionally, earlier efforts on data augmentation by altering contexts rely on rule-based methods, which result in generated contexts that lack diversity and coherence. To address these issues, we propose a Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation (PODA) framework. This framework can generate CoT rationales including analyses for both correct and incorrect options, while constructing diverse and high-quality counterfactual contexts from incorrect candidate options. We integrate summarizing premises and identifying premises for each option into rationales. Subsequently, we employ multi-step prompts with identified premises to construct counterfactual context. To facilitate the model's capabilities to better differentiate the reasoning process associated with each option, we introduce a novel thought-path contrastive learning method that compares reasoning paths between the original and counterfactual samples. Experimental results on three representative LLMs demonstrate that our method can improve the baselines substantially across two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks (ReClor and LogiQA 2.0). The data and code are released at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/TPReasoner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We present Frontend Diffusion, a multi-stage agentic system, transforms user-drawn layouts and textual prompts into refined website code, thereby supporting self-representation goals. A user study with 13 junior researchers and designers shows AI as a human capability enhancer rather than a replacement, and highlights the importance of bidirectional human-AI alignment. We then discuss future work such as leveraging AI for career development and fostering bidirectional human-AI alignment on the intent level.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |

LLMs were tested on legal reasoning tasks involving rule analysis and analogical reasoning. The results show that LLMs can conduct basic IRAC analysis, but are limited by brief responses lacking detail, an inability to commit to answers, false confidence, and hallucinations. The study compares legal and nonlegal LLMs, identifies shortcomings, and explores traits that may hinder their ability to think like a lawyer. It also discusses the implications for legal education and practice, highlighting the need for critical thinking skills in future lawyers and the potential pitfalls of overreliance on artificial intelligence AI resulting in a loss of logic, reasoning, and critical thinking skills.</p></details> |  |

Modern AI models rely on standard neural computation-inner-product-based transformations and nonlinear activations-to approximate patterns from data. While effective for inductive learning, this architecture lacks the structural guarantees necessary for deductive inference and logical consistency. As a result, deep networks struggle with rule-based reasoning, structured generalization, and interpretability without extensive post-hoc modifications. This position paper argues that standard neural layers must be fundamentally rethought to integrate logical reasoning. We advocate for Logical Neural Units (LNUs)-modular components that embed differentiable approximations of logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) directly within neural architectures. We critique existing neurosymbolic approaches, highlight the limitations of standard neural computation for logical inference, and present LNUs as a necessary paradigm shift in AI. Finally, we outline a roadmap for implementation, discussing theoretical foundations, architectural integration, and key challenges for future research.</p></details> |  |

A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning.

To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty. Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://huggingface.co/spaces/WildEval/ZebraLogic</p></details> |

However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06967v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive processing and slower, logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ. We introduce an adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also aids in studying the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. The evidence underscores the importance of shape in identifying instances in human vision. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. Our study shows that segmentation models lack an understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to the position and number of sub-components. Additionally, the similarity in errors made by models and intuitive human processing indicates that models only address intuitive thinking in human vision. In contrast, multi-modal LLMs, including open-source models, demonstrate tremendous progress on errors made in intuitive processing. The models have improved performance on images that require logical reasoning and show recognition of sub-components. However, they have not matched the performance improvements made on errors in intuitive processing.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes. We construct an affine calculus for 1-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers. Examples of reasoning in the logic include proofs of upper bounds on distances of processes. We also show how our logic can express coupling proofs - a powerful technique for comparing probabilistic processes.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a formal framework based on symbolic compression,integrating combinatory logic, information-theoretic optimal encoding, and context-aware inference techniques to achieve a step-change improvement in token efficiency while preserving semantic integrity. We establish a mathematical framework within a functional programming paradigm, derive the quantitative relationship between symbolic density and model interpretability, and propose a differentiable compression factor metric to evaluate encoding efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to achieve a low-cost application of the GAEL language. Experimental results show that this method achieves a 78.3% token compression rate in code generation tasks while improving logical traceability by 62% through structural explicitness. This research provides new theoretical tools for efficient inference in LLMs and opens a symbolic path for modelinterpretability research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instantiation-based Formalization of Logical Reasoning Tasks using Language Models and Logical Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16961v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches, limited by their training on specific performance metrics for predefined scenarios, struggle to generalize across diverse faults and anomalies in varying network environments. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various domains. Building on this success, we propose NetSemantic, a plug-and-play intelligent network fault diagnosis framework based on LLMs. NetSemantic transforms multimodal network information into unified textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and generate efficient fault resolutions and health assessment reports. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method that transforms logically strong network information into symbols. Additionally, we propose a self-adaptive data updating mechanism that dynamically incorporates network information into a knowledge graph to ensure the validity and timeliness of the knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that NetSemantic excels in network fault diagnosis across various complex scenarios, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | 10 pages,10 figures |

In this work, we define the novel task of routing an end-user query to the appropriate data-source, where the data-sources are databases. We synthesize datasets by extending existing datasets designed for NL-to-SQL semantic parsing. We create baselines on these datasets by using open-source LLMs, using both pre-trained and task specific embeddings fine-tuned using the training data. With these baselines we demonstrate that open-source LLMs perform better than embedding based approach, but suffer from token length limitations. Embedding based approaches benefit from task specific fine-tuning, more so when there is availability of data in terms of database specific questions for training. We further find that the task becomes more difficult (i) with an increase in the number of data-sources, (ii) having data-sources closer in terms of their domains,(iii) having databases without external domain knowledge required to interpret its entities and (iv) with ambiguous and complex queries requiring more fine-grained understanding of the data-sources or logical reasoning for routing to an appropriate source. This calls for the need for developing more sophisticated solutions to better address the task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st Workshop on GenAI and RAG Systems for Enterprise at CIKM 2024 Conference. 10 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024 as Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as an Indirect Reasoner: Contrapositive and Contradiction for Automated Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03667v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, increasing attention has been focused on improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. Advanced methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants, are found to enhance their reasoning skills by designing suitable prompts or breaking down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems. However, little concentration has been put on exploring the reasoning process, \textit{i.e.}, we discovered that most methods resort to Direct Reasoning (DR) and disregard Indirect Reasoning (IR). This can make LLMs difficult to solve IR tasks, which are often encountered in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a Direct-Indirect Reasoning (DIR) method, which considers DR and IR as multiple parallel reasoning paths that are merged to derive the final answer. We stimulate LLMs to implement IR by crafting prompt templates incorporating the principles of contrapositive and contradiction. These templates trigger LLMs to assume the negation of the conclusion as true, combine it with the premises to deduce a conclusion, and utilize the logical equivalence of the contrapositive to enhance their comprehension of the rules used in the reasoning process. Our DIR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing variants of CoT methods. Experimental results on four datasets related to logical reasoning and mathematic proof demonstrate that our DIR method, when combined with various baseline methods, significantly outperforms all the original methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[SedarEval: Automated Evaluation using Self-Adaptive Rubrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15595v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called SedarEval, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. SedarEval consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach. We release our dataset at https://github.com/wwn1233/sedareval.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that most state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs perform significantly worse than the human average, demonstrating substantial room for model improvement.

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics with Human Judgement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text predicates, often goes unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of sensitivity of existing metrics and their alignment with human judgement on FOL evaluation. Using ground-truth FOLs, we carefully designed various perturbations on the ground-truth to assess metric sensitivity. We sample FOL translation candidates for natural language statements and measure the ranking alignment between automatic metrics and human annotators. Our empirical findings highlight oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations, the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural perturbations, and FOL metric for operator perturbation. We also observe a closer alignment between BertScore and human judgement. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both alignment and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/RamyaKeerthy/AlignmentFOL</p></details> |

While post hoc explanation methods attempt to address this issue, they often fail to accurately represent these black-box models, resulting in misleading or incomplete explanations. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inherently transparent model architecture called Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), which enable compositional and interpretable predictions through logical reasoning. In particular, an NPC consists of two modules: an attribute recognition model, which predicts probabilities for various attributes, and a task predictor built on a probabilistic circuit, which enables logical reasoning over recognized attributes to make class predictions. To train NPCs, we introduce a three-stage training algorithm comprising attribute recognition, circuit construction, and joint optimization. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that an NPC's error is upper-bounded by a linear combination of the errors from its modules. To further demonstrate the interpretability of NPC, we provide both the most probable explanations and the counterfactual explanations. Empirical results on four benchmark datasets show that NPCs strike a balance between interpretability and performance, achieving results competitive even with those of end-to-end black-box models while providing enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, their generalisation and robustness when performing logical reasoning has not been sufficiently assessed. To comprehensively evaluate this ability, we develop three new logical reasoning datasets named "ReClor-plus", "LogiQA-plus" and "LogiQAv2-plus" that extend standard logical reasoning datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LLM's reasoning. For each, we create three subsets: the first with randomly shuffled options, the second with the correct choices replaced by "none of the other options is correct", and the third with a combination of shuffling and substitution. Experiments on these datasets show that these simple augmentations greatly hinder the models' performance. Despite their high performance on the original publicly available datasets, we find that all models perform poorly on these newly constructed datasets. We also demonstrate that introducing task variations into the training set can markedly improve the model's performance on both the original and our developed datasets. Finally, we show that applying logic-driven data augmentation for fine-tuning and prompting can enhance generalisation in both discriminative and generative models, offering a path to improving their robustness for tasks involving logical reasoning.

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18023v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In neuroscience, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems have evolved considerably with the popularization of visual language models. In this paper, we propose LeapVAD, a novel method based on cognitive perception and dual-process thinking. Our approach implements a human-attentional mechanism to identify and focus on critical traffic elements that influence driving decisions. By characterizing these objects through comprehensive attributes - including appearance, motion patterns, and associated risks - LeapVAD achieves more effective environmental representation and streamlines the decision-making process. Furthermore, LeapVAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module miming the human-driving learning process. The system consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) that accumulates driving experience through logical reasoning and a Heuristic Process (System-I) that refines this knowledge via fine-tuning and few-shot learning. LeapVAD also includes reflective mechanisms and a growing memory bank, enabling it to learn from past mistakes and continuously improve its performance in a closed-loop environment. To enhance efficiency, we develop a scene encoder network that generates compact scene representations for rapid retrieval of relevant driving experiences. Extensive evaluations conducted on two leading autonomous driving simulators, CARLA and DriveArena, demonstrate that LeapVAD achieves superior performance compared to camera-only approaches despite limited training data. Comprehensive ablation studies further emphasize its effectiveness in continuous learning and domain adaptation. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/LeapVAD/.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial. Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks. However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided. Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning? In this paper, we propose Reasoning with Graphs (RwG) by first constructing explicit graphs from the context and then leveraging these graphs to enhance LLM reasoning performance on reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07752v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeLogic: A Temporal Logic Benchmark for Video QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07214v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logical understanding, a core facet of human cognition, plays a pivotal role in capturing complex sequential events and their temporal relationships within videos. This capability is particularly crucial in tasks like Video Question Answering (VideoQA), where the goal is to process visual data over time together with textual data to provide coherent answers. However, current VideoQA benchmarks devote little focus to evaluating this critical skill due to the challenge of annotating temporal logic. Despite the advancement of vision-language models, assessing their temporal logical reasoning powers remains a challenge, primarily due to the lack QA pairs that demand formal, complex temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the TimeLogic QA (TLQA) framework to automatically generate the QA pairs, specifically designed to evaluate the temporal logical understanding. To this end, TLQA leverages temporal annotations from existing video datasets together with temporal operators derived from logic theory to construct questions that test understanding of event sequences and their temporal relationships. TLQA framework is generic and scalable, capable of leveraging both, existing video action datasets with temporal action segmentation annotations, or video datasets with temporal scene graph annotations, to automatically generate temporal logical questions. We leverage 4 datasets, STAR, Breakfast, AGQA, and CrossTask, and generate two VideoQA dataset variants - small (TLQA-S) and large (TLQA-L) - containing 2k and 10k QA pairs for each category, resulting in 32k and 160k total pairs per dataset. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of leading-edge VideoQA models, employing the TLQA to benchmark their temporal logical understanding capabilities. We assess the VideoQA model's temporal reasoning performance on 16 categories of temporal logic with varying temporal complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 7.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

This capability is essential in applications such as industrial inspection, where logical anomaly detection is critical for maintaining high-quality standards and minimizing costly recalls. Previous research in anomaly detection (AD) has relied on prior knowledge for designing algorithms, which often requires extensive manual annotations, significant computing power, and large amounts of data for training. Autoregressive, multimodal Vision Language Models (AVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their exceptional performance in visual reasoning across various domains. Despite this, their application to logical AD remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate using AVLMs for logical AD and demonstrate that they are well-suited to the task. Combining AVLMs with format embedding and a logic reasoner, we achieve SOTA performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 86.0% and F1-max of 83.7%, along with explanations of anomalies. This significantly outperforms the existing SOTA method by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at aaai25, project page: https://jasonjin34.github.io/logicad.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Bongard-OpenWorld: Few-Shot Reasoning for Free-form Visual Concepts in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10207v6)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating real-world few-shot reasoning for machine vision. It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Question Answering via Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18537v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI'2025</p></details> |
| **[SecBench: A Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking Dataset for LLMs in Cybersecurity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20787v3)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs. Benchmarking results on 16 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowRA: Knowledge Retrieval Augmented Method for Document-level Relation Extraction with Comprehensive Reasoning Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00571v2)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document-level relation extraction (Doc-RE) aims to extract relations between entities across multiple sentences. Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Model Acceleration based on KV Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19442v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

| **[Enhancing Transformers for Generalizable First-Order Logical Entailment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00759v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, as a fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning. This paper investigates the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and explores ways to improve it. The first-order reasoning capability of transformers is assessed through their ability to perform first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) the unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, enabling a characterization of fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset show that transformers outperform previous methods specifically designed for this task and provide detailed empirical evidence on the impact of input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our findings reveal a mismatch between positional encoding and other design choices in transformer architectures employed in prior practices. This discovery motivates us to propose a more sophisticated, logic-aware architecture, TEGA, to enhance the capability for generalizable first-order logical entailment in transformers.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Traditionally, the control aspects of biomedical systems have been analyzed using manual proofs and computer based analysis tools. However, these approaches provide inaccurate results due to human error in manual proofs and unverified algorithms and round-off errors in computer-based tools. We argue using Interactive reasoning, or frequently called theorem proving, to analyze control systems of biomedical engineering applications, specifically in the context of Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). Our methodology involves constructing mathematical models of the control components using Higher-order Logic (HOL) and analyzing them through deductive reasoning in the HOL Light theorem prover. We propose to model these control systems in terms of their block diagram representations, which in turn utilize the corresponding differential equations and their transfer function-based representation using the Laplace Transform (LT). These formally represented block diagrams are then analyzed through logical reasoning in the trusted environment of a theorem prover to ensure the correctness of the results. For illustration, we present a real-world case study by analyzing the control system of the ultrafilteration dialysis process.</p></details> | <details><summary>11th ...</summary><p>11th International Conference on Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering (ICMRE), Lille, France, 2025</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities on certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios including street scene, receipt, formula, diagram, and so on), and thorough evaluation metrics, with a total of 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs on OCRBench v2, we find that 20 out of 22 LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/Yuliang-liu/MultimodalOCR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414v3)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side. The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distance-Restricted Explanations: Theoretical Underpinnings & Efficient Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08297v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The uses of machine learning (ML) have snowballed in recent years. In many cases, ML models are highly complex, and their operation is beyond the understanding of human decision-makers. Nevertheless, some uses of ML models involve high-stakes and safety-critical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help human decision-makers in understanding the operation of such complex ML models, thus eliciting trust in their operation. Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructTest: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning through Compositional Structured Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18011v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) necessitates robust, unbiased, and scalable methods for evaluating their capabilities. However, human annotations are expensive to scale, model-based evaluations are prone to biases in answer style, while target-answer-based benchmarks are vulnerable to data contamination and cheating. To address these limitations, we propose StructTest, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to produce compositionally specified structured outputs as an unbiased, cheap-to-run and difficult-to-cheat measure. The evaluation is done deterministically by a rule-based evaluator, which can be easily extended to new tasks. By testing structured outputs across diverse task domains -- including Summarization, Code, HTML and Math -- we demonstrate that StructTest serves as a good proxy for general reasoning abilities, as producing structured outputs often requires internal logical reasoning. We believe that StructTest offers a critical, complementary approach to objective and robust model evaluation.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$_{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$_{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

The transformer is the pervasive backbone architecture for the foundation model construction. It is vital to research how to adjust the Transformer architecture to achieve an end-to-end privacy guarantee in LLM fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate three potential information leakage during a federated fine-tuning procedure for LLM (FedLLM). Based on the potential information leakage, we provide an end-to-end privacy guarantee solution for FedLLM by inserting two-stage randomness. The first stage is to train a gradient auto-encoder with a Gaussian random prior based on the statistical information of the gradients generated by local clients. The second stage is to fine-tune the overall LLM with a differential privacy guarantee by adopting appropriate Gaussian noises. We show the efficiency and accuracy gains of our proposed method with several foundation models and two popular evaluation benchmarks. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive privacy analysis with Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP).</p></details> |  |

However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://github.com/Aiden0526/Aristotle.</p></details> |  |

We hope for this to lay the foundation to exploring different methods of using RAGs to improve the performance of LLMs in advanced logical reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses -- a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination, jailbreaking, etc. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitates an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are three-fold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries as input and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, specially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts.</p></details> | Under review |

Evaluating Interventions for Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15584v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust. Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with 400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making incorrect reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance interventions in human-LLM collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the need for efficient and accurate methods to harmonize the growing volume of survey data with standardized disease ontologies, we employed BERN2, a biomedical named entity recognition and normalization model, to extract disease information from the ORIGINS birth cohort survey data. After rigorously evaluating BERN2's performance against a manually curated ground truth dataset, we integrated various LLMs using prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Instructional Fine-Tuning (IFT) to refine the model's outputs. BERN2 demonstrated high performance in extracting and normalizing disease mentions, and the integration of LLMs, particularly with Few Shot Inference and RAG orchestration, further improved accuracy. This approach, especially when incorporating structured examples, logical reasoning prompts, and detailed context, offers a promising avenue for developing tools to enable efficient cohort profiling and data harmonization across large, heterogeneous research datasets.</p></details> |  |

By integrating these symbolic AI methods, we encode domain-specific constraints, rules, and logical reasoning directly into the model's learning process, thereby improving both performance and trustworthiness. The proposed approach is flexible and applicable to both regression and classification tasks, demonstrating generalizability across various fields such as healthcare, autonomous systems, engineering, and battery manufacturing applications. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, the strength of our approach lies in its scalability across different domains. The design allows for the automation of the loss function by simply updating the ASP rules, making the system highly scalable and user-friendly. This facilitates seamless adaptation to new domains without significant redesign, offering a practical solution for integrating expert knowledge into DL models in industrial settings such as battery manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well in generating accurate outputs, their "black box" nature poses significant challenges to transparency and trust. To address this, the paper proposes the TranspNet pipeline, which integrates symbolic AI with LLMs. By leveraging domain expert knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and formal reasoning frameworks like Answer Set Programming (ASP), TranspNet enhances LLM outputs with structured reasoning and verification.This approach strives to help AI systems deliver results that are as accurate, explainable, and trustworthy as possible, aligning with regulatory expectations for transparency and accountability. TranspNet provides a solution for developing AI systems that are reliable and interpretable, making it suitable for real-world applications where trust is critical.</p></details> |  |

However, an in-depth study on the relationship between knowledge proficiency, especially essential driving expertise, and closed-loop autonomous driving performance requires further exploration. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the depth and breadth of fundamental driving knowledge on closed-loop trajectory planning and introduce WiseAD, a specialized VLM tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving capable of driving reasoning, action justification, object recognition, risk analysis, driving suggestions, and trajectory planning across diverse scenarios. We employ joint training on driving knowledge and planning datasets, enabling the model to perform knowledge-aligned trajectory planning accordingly. Extensive experiments indicate that as the diversity of driving knowledge extends, critical accidents are notably reduced, contributing 11.9% and 12.4% improvements in the driving score and route completion on the Carla closed-loop evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, WiseAD also demonstrates remarkable performance in knowledge evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework with a new human-annotated dataset to pinpoint model strengths and weaknesses, advancing from single-skill tasks to multi-skill tasks, and ultimately to complex reasoning tasks that require the integration of multiple spatial and visual cues with logical reasoning. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source models reveal significant shortcomings, especially in the abilities to understand distance and proximity, to reason from both allocentric and egocentric viewpoints, and to perform complex reasoning in a physical context. This work underscores the need for more advanced approaches to spatial understanding and reasoning, paving the way for improvements in vision-language models and their alignment with human-like spatial capabilities. The dataset will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of using graph-based synthetic reasoning data as training signals to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our extensive experiments, conducted on two established natural language reasoning tasks -- inductive reasoning and spatial reasoning -- demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic graph-based reasoning data effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning performance without compromising their effectiveness on other standard evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Empowering Natural Language Proof Generation with Contrastive Stepwise Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06736v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning remains a pivotal component within the realm of artificial intelligence. The recent evolution of large language models (LLMs) has marked significant progress in this domain. The adoption of strategies like chain-of-thought (CoT) has enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, logical reasoning that involves proof planning, specifically those that necessitate the validation of explanation accuracy, continues to present stumbling blocks. In this study, we first evaluate the efficacy of LLMs with advanced CoT strategies concerning such tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs still struggle to navigate complex reasoning chains, which demand the meticulous linkage of premises to derive a cogent conclusion. To address this issue, we finetune a smaller-scale language model, equipping it to decompose proof objectives into more manageable subgoals. We also introduce contrastive decoding to stepwise proof generation, making use of negative reasoning paths to strengthen the model's capacity for logical deduction. Experiments on EntailmentBank underscore the success of our method in augmenting the proof planning abilities of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently undergoing extensive revisions and improvements</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Table Comprehension In The Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09884v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), while being increasingly dominant on a myriad of knowledge-intensive activities, have only had limited success understanding lengthy table-text mixtures, such as academic papers and financial reports. Recent advances of long-context LLMs have opened up new possibilities for this field. Nonetheless, we identify two roadblocks: (1) Prior benchmarks of table question answering (TableQA) have focused on isolated tables without context, making it hard to evaluate models in real-world scenarios. (2) Prior benchmarks have focused on some narrow skill sets of table comprehension such as table recognition, data manipulation/calculation, table summarization etc., while a skilled human employs those skills collectively. In this work, we introduce TableQuest, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the holistic table comprehension capabilities of LLMs in the natural table-rich context of financial reports. We employ a rigorous data processing and filtering procedure to ensure that the question-answer pairs are logical, reasonable, and diverse. We experiment with 7 state-of-the-art models, and find that despite reasonable accuracy in locating facts, they often falter when required to execute more sophisticated reasoning or multi-step calculations. We conclude with a qualitative study of the failure modes and discuss the challenges of constructing a challenging benchmark. We make the evaluation data, judging procedure and results of this study publicly available to facilitate research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TRL Workshop@Neurips 2024.

| **[Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04264v5)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dspy-based Neural-Symbolic Pipeline to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18564v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often struggle with spatial reasoning. This paper presents a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities through iterative feedback between LLMs and Answer Set Programming (ASP). We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting baseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with iterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP pipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82% accuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and 8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key innovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning through a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and ASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that addresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose Facts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance on complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis across different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini) demonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability, contributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. These results highlight significant challenges in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data and Codes are available at https://github.com/skyriver-2000/RuleArena</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning-Aware Query-Focused Summarization over Multi-Table Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08970v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-focused summarization over multi-table data is a challenging yet critical task for extracting precise and relevant information from structured data. Existing methods often rely on complex preprocessing steps and struggle to generalize across domains or handle the logical reasoning required for multi-table queries. In this paper, we propose QueryTableSummarizer++, an end-to-end generative framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced with table-aware pre-training, query-aligned fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with feedback. Our method eliminates the need for intermediate serialization steps and directly generates query-relevant summaries. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that QueryTableSummarizer++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-score. Additional analyses highlight its scalability, generalization across domains, and robust handling of complex queries. Human evaluation further validates the superior quality and practical applicability of the generated summaries, establishing QueryTableSummarizer++ as a highly effective solution for multi-table summarization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Categorical Syllogisms Revisited: A Review of the Logical Reasoning Abilities of LLMs for Analyzing Categorical Syllogism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18762v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There have been a huge number of benchmarks proposed to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) behave for logic inference tasks. However, it remains an open question how to properly evaluate this ability. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of prior works on the logical reasoning ability of LLMs for analyzing categorical syllogisms. We first investigate all the possible variations for the categorical syllogisms from a purely logical perspective and then examine the underlying configurations (i.e., mood and figure) tested by the existing datasets. Our results indicate that compared to template-based synthetic datasets, crowdsourcing approaches normally sacrifice the coverage of configurations (i.e., mood and figure) of categorical syllogisms for more language variations, thus bringing challenges to fully testing LLMs under different situations. We then proceed to summarize the findings and observations for the performances of LLMs to infer the validity of syllogisms from the current literature. The error rate breakdown analyses suggest that the interpretation of the quantifiers seems to be the current bottleneck that limits the performances of the LLMs and is thus worth more attention. Finally, we discuss several points that might be worth considering when researchers plan on the future release of categorical syllogism datasets. We hope our work will not only provide a timely review of the current literature regarding categorical syllogisms, but also motivate more interdisciplinary research between communities, specifically computational linguists and logicians.</p></details> | camera-ready version |
| **[Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08054v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents. The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data. However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions. The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters. Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL. In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods. Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithmic Phase Transitions in Language Models: A Mechanistic Case Study of Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07386v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot capabilities of large language models make them powerful tools for solving a range of tasks without explicit training. It remains unclear, however, how these models achieve such performance, or why they can zero-shot some tasks but not others. In this paper, we shed some light on this phenomenon by defining and investigating algorithmic stability in language models -- changes in problem-solving strategy employed by the model as a result of changes in task specification. We focus on a task where algorithmic stability is needed for generalization: two-operand arithmetic. Surprisingly, we find that Gemma-2-2b employs substantially different computational models on closely related subtasks, i.e. four-digit versus eight-digit addition. Our findings suggest that algorithmic instability may be a contributing factor to language models' poor zero-shot performance across certain logical reasoning tasks, as they struggle to abstract different problem-solving strategies and smoothly transition between them.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve. We perform our study on two fronts. First, we pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch and attains perfect test accuracy, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" mechanisms in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. Second, we study how pretrained LLMs, namely Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B, solve this problem. We characterize their reasoning circuits through causal intervention experiments, providing necessity and sufficiency evidence for the circuits. We find evidence suggesting that the two models' latent reasoning strategies are surprisingly similar, and human-like. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.</p></details> |  |

Using established benchmarks, we compared the o1-preview models's performance to human participants from diverse educational levels. o1-preview achieved a mean score of 24.33 on the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test (EWCTET), surpassing undergraduate (13.8) and postgraduate (18.39) participants (z = 1.60 and 0.90, respectively). In systematic thinking, it scored 46.1, SD = 4.12 on the Lake Urmia Vignette, significantly outperforming the human mean (20.08, SD = 8.13, z = 3.20). For data literacy, o1-preview scored 8.60, SD = 0.70 on Merk et al.'s "Use Data" dimension, compared to the human post-test mean of 4.17, SD = 2.02 (z = 2.19). On creative thinking tasks, the model achieved originality scores of 2.98, SD = 0.73, higher than the human mean of 1.74 (z = 0.71). In logical reasoning (LogiQA), it outperformed humans with average 90%, SD = 10% accuracy versus 86%, SD = 6.5% (z = 0.62). For scientific reasoning, it achieved near-perfect performance (mean = 0.99, SD = 0.12) on the TOSLS,, exceeding the highest human scores of 0.85, SD = 0.13 (z = 1.78). While o1-preview excelled in structured tasks, it showed limitations in problem-solving and adaptive reasoning. These results demonstrate the potential of AI to complement education in structured assessments but highlight the need for ethical oversight and refinement for broader applications.</p></details> |  |

Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04937v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |

To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as "The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Our approach leverages the concept of hot and cold tokens, where hot tokens are prioritized for their contextual relevance, while cold tokens provide supplementary information. This dynamic modulation of token importance enables the model to achieve superior logical reasoning capabilities compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that our temperature-guided attention mechanism converges to optimal reasoning paths with exponential guarantees. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across a wide range of tasks, making advanced AI reasoning accessible to a broader range of applications.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, researchers have employed carefully designed prompts and flowcharts, simulating human cognitive processes to enhance LLM performance, such as the Chain of Thought approach. In this paper, we introduce MTMT (Multi-thinking Modes Tree), a novel method that interacts with LLMs to construct a thought tree, simulating various advanced cognitive processes, including but not limited to association, counterfactual thinking, task decomposition, and comparison. By breaking down the original complex task into simpler sub-questions, MTMT facilitates easier problem-solving for LLMs, enabling more effective utilization of the latent knowledge within LLMs. We evaluate the performance of MTMT under different parameter configurations, using GPT-4o mini as the base model. Our results demonstrate that integrating multiple modes of thinking significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Multi-Hop Question Answering with Knowledge Graph Integration in Evolving Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15903v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The important challenge of keeping knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) up-to-date has led to the development of various methods for incorporating new facts. However, existing methods for such knowledge editing still face difficulties with multi-hop questions that require accurate fact identification and sequential logical reasoning, particularly among numerous fact updates. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straightforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03213v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recent techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, have significantly advanced multi-step reasoning by introducing step-by-step decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, these approaches often rely on static prompting templates that do not adapt to task complexity or errors during the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Prompting, a dynamic and iterative framework designed to enhance reasoning by incorporating real-time adjustments to prompt structures and validation mechanisms.Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Prompting significantly improves performance on diverse reasoning benchmarks, including arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, MultiArith), logical reasoning and commonsense tasks, achieving substantial accuracy gains compared to static prompting baselines. By integrating guided prompts, intermediate validation, and self-corrective steps, our approach enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger counterparts, such as GPT-4, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Humans excel at these tasks by leveraging deliberate planning with an internal world model to simulate the potential outcomes of various actions. Inspired by this, we propose a novel multi-step reasoning framework for LLMs, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with Accurate World Model (SWAP). Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in natural language, SWAP incorporates structural information to guide the reasoning process via a world model and provides a soft verification mechanism over the steps. Moreover, SWAP overcomes the challenge of accurate world state predictions in complex reasoning tasks by introducing a Generator-Discriminator architecture, which enables more reliable world modeling. Specifically, the generator predicts the next state, and the discriminator ensures alignment with the logical consistency required by the problem context. SWAP also encourages the policy model to explore a broad range of potential actions to prevent premature convergence. By resolving the bottlenecks of generation diversity for both actions and states using diversity-based modeling (DBM) and improving discrimination accuracy through contrastive ranking (CR), SWAP significantly enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP achieves substantial improvements over the baselines and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these benchmarks are limited to specific visual programming scenarios where the logic reasoning and the multimodal understanding capacities are split apart. To fill this gap, we propose ScratchEval, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the visual programming reasoning ability of LMMs. ScratchEval is based on Scratch, a block-based visual programming language widely used in children's programming education. By integrating visual elements and embedded programming logic, ScratchEval requires the model to process both visual information and code structure, thereby comprehensively evaluating its programming intent understanding ability.

| **[Learning for Long-Horizon Planning via Neuro-Symbolic Abductive Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18201v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent learning-to-imitation methods have shown promising results in planning via imitating within the observation-action space. However, their ability in open environments remains constrained, particularly in long-horizon tasks. In contrast, traditional symbolic planning excels in long-horizon tasks through logical reasoning over human-defined symbolic spaces but struggles to handle observations beyond symbolic states, such as high-dimensional visual inputs encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we draw inspiration from abductive learning and introduce a novel framework \textbf{AB}ductive \textbf{I}mitation \textbf{L}earning (ABIL) that integrates the benefits of data-driven learning and symbolic-based reasoning, enabling long-horizon planning. Specifically, we employ abductive reasoning to understand the demonstrations in symbolic space and design the principles of sequential consistency to resolve the conflicts between perception and reasoning. ABIL generates predicate candidates to facilitate the perception from raw observations to symbolic space without laborious predicate annotations, providing a groundwork for symbolic planning. With the symbolic understanding, we further develop a policy ensemble whose base policies are built with different logical objectives and managed through symbolic reasoning. Experiments show that our proposal successfully understands the observations with the task-relevant symbolics to assist the imitation learning. Importantly, ABIL demonstrates significantly improved data efficiency and generalization across various long-horizon tasks, highlighting it as a promising solution for long-horizon planning.

To address this, we propose the Sentiment Cross-Lingual Recognition and Logic Framework (SentiXRL), which incorporates two modules,an emotion retrieval enhancement module to improve sentiment classification accuracy in complex contexts through historical dialogue and logical reasoning,and a self-circulating analysis negotiation mechanism (SANM)to facilitates autonomous decision-making within a single model for classification tasks.We have validated SentiXRL's superiority on multiple standard datasets, outperforming existing models on CPED and CH-SIMS,and achieving overall better performance on MELD,Emorynlp and IEMOCAP. Notably, we unified labels across several fine-grained sentiment annotation datasets and conducted category confusion experiments, revealing challenges and impacts of class imbalance in standard datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIE: MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable AIGC Image Implausibility Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17261v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details; and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Visual Assessment for Text-to-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15509v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation models have achieved remarkable progress in computer graphics applications but still face significant challenges in real-world deployment. Current assessment approaches for visual generation tasks typically follow an isolated three-phase framework: test input collection, model output generation, and user assessment. These fashions suffer from fixed coverage, evolving difficulty, and data leakage risks, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively evaluating increasingly complex generation models. To address these limitations, we propose DyEval, an LLM-powered dynamic interactive visual assessment framework that facilitates collaborative evaluation between humans and generative models for text-to-image systems. DyEval features an intuitive visual interface that enables users to interactively explore and analyze model behaviors, while adaptively generating hierarchical, fine-grained, and diverse textual inputs to continuously probe the capability boundaries of the models based on their feedback. Additionally, to provide interpretable analysis for users to further improve tested models, we develop a contextual reflection module that mines failure triggers of test inputs and reflects model potential failure patterns supporting in-depth analysis using the logical reasoning ability of LLM. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DyEval can effectively help users identify max up to 2.56 times generation failures than conventional methods, and uncover complex and rare failure patterns, such as issues with pronoun generation and specific cultural context generation. Our framework provides valuable insights for improving generative models and has broad implications for advancing the reliability and capabilities of visual generation systems across various domains.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[XAgents: A Framework for Interpretable Rule-Based Multi-Agents Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13932v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting implicit knowledge and logical reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) has consistently been a significant challenge. The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p></details> |  |

This is motivated by the fact that the rich combinatorial nature of data in certain reasoning tasks (e.g., arithmetic/logic) makes representative data sampling challenging, and learning successfully under GOTU gives a first vignette of an 'extrapolating' or 'reasoning' learner. We study how different network architectures trained by (S)GD perform under GOTU and provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that for sparse functions and a class of network models including instances of Transformers, random features models, and linear networks, a min-degree-interpolator is learned on the unseen. More specifically, this means an interpolator of the training data that has minimal Fourier mass on the higher degree basis elements. These findings lead to two implications: (1) we provide an explanation to the length generalization problem for Boolean functions (e.g., Anil et al. 2022); (2) we introduce a curriculum learning algorithm called Degree-Curriculum that learns monomials more efficiently by incrementing supports. Finally, we discuss extensions to other models or non-sparse regimes where the min-degree bias may still occur or fade, as well as how it can be potentially corrected when undesirable.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended JMLR version of the original ICML 2023 paper</p></details> |
| **[Testing Uncertainty of Large Language Models for Physics Knowledge and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14465v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in recent years for their ability to answer questions in various fields. However, these models have a tendency to "hallucinate" their responses, making it challenging to evaluate their performance. A major challenge is determining how to assess the certainty of a model's predictions and how it correlates with accuracy. In this work, we introduce an analysis for evaluating the performance of popular open-source LLMs, as well as gpt-3.5 Turbo, on multiple choice physics questionnaires. We focus on the relationship between answer accuracy and variability in topics related to physics. Our findings suggest that most models provide accurate replies in cases where they are certain, but this is by far not a general behavior. The relationship between accuracy and uncertainty exposes a broad horizontal bell-shaped distribution. We report how the asymmetry between accuracy and uncertainty intensifies as the questions demand more logical reasoning of the LLM agent, while the same relationship remains sharp for knowledge retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for programs with effects, nondeterminism, and nontermination is difficult. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not executable code, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics. Reasoning about infinite traces and automata requires complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a structural approach to the verification of temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call Ticl. Using Ticl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform mechanized proofs of general temporal properties, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of ticl by giving short, structural proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with queues, secure memory, and distributed consensus.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

The study utilizes their logical reasoning, scene understanding, and decision-making capabilities to optimize throughput and provide feedback based on traffic conditions in real-time. LLMs centralize traditionally disconnected traffic control processes and can integrate traffic data from diverse sources to provide context-aware decisions. LLMs can also deliver tailored outputs using various means such as wireless signals and visuals to drivers, infrastructures, and autonomous vehicles. To evaluate LLMs ability as traffic controllers, this study proposed a four-stage methodology. The methodology includes data creation and environment initialization, prompt engineering, conflict identification, and fine-tuning. We simulated multi-lane four-leg intersection scenarios and generates detailed datasets to enable conflict detection using LLMs and Python simulation as a ground truth. We used chain-of-thought prompts to lead LLMs in understanding the context, detecting conflicts, resolving them using traffic rules, and delivering context-sensitive traffic management solutions. We evaluated the prformance GPT-mini, Gemini, and Llama as traffic controllers. Results showed that the fine-tuned GPT-mini achieved 83% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.84. GPT-mini model exhibited a promising performance in generating actionable traffic management insights, with high ROUGE-L scores across conflict identification of 0.95, decision-making of 0.91, priority assignment of 0.94, and waiting time optimization of 0.92. We demonstrated that LLMs can offer precise recommendations to drivers in real-time including yielding, slowing, or stopping based on vehicle dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The data and code that support the findings of this study are openly available in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14171745, reference number 14171745</p></details> |
| **[AutoIoT: Automated IoT Platform Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10665v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IoT platforms, particularly smart home platforms providing significant convenience to people's lives such as Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings, allow users to create automation rules through trigger-action programming. However, some users may lack the necessary knowledge to formulate automation rules, thus preventing them from fully benefiting from the conveniences offered by smart home technology. To address this, smart home platforms provide pre-defined automation policies based on the smart home devices registered by the user. Nevertheless, these policies, being pre-generated and relatively simple, fail to adequately cover the diverse needs of users. Furthermore, conflicts may arise between automation rules, and integrating conflict detection into the IoT platform increases the burden on developers. In this paper, we propose AutoIoT, an automated IoT platform based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and formal verification techniques, designed to achieve end-to-end automation through device information extraction, LLM-based rule generation, conflict detection, and avoidance. AutoIoT can help users generate conflict-free automation rules and assist developers in generating codes for conflict detection, thereby enhancing their experience. A code adapter has been designed to separate logical reasoning from the syntactic details of code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code for programming languages beyond their training data. Finally, we evaluated the performance of AutoIoT and presented a case study demonstrating how AutoIoT can integrate with existing IoT platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces a simulation framework utilizing the game Balderdash to evaluate both the creativity and logical reasoning of LLMs. In Balderdash, players generate fictitious definitions for obscure terms to deceive others while identifying correct definitions. Our framework enables multiple LLM agents to participate in this game, assessing their ability to produce plausible definitions and strategize based on game rules and history. We implemented a centralized game engine featuring various LLMs as participants and a judge LLM to evaluate semantic equivalence. Through a series of experiments, we analyzed the performance of different LLMs, examining metrics such as True Definition Ratio, Deception Ratio, and Correct Guess Ratio. The results provide insights into the creative and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Specifically, the study reveals that infrequent vocabulary in LLMs' input leads to poor reasoning on game rules and historical context (https://github.com/ParsaHejabi/Simulation-Framework-for-Multi-Agent-Balderdash).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Wordplay: When Language Meets Games @ ACL 2024</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks, were not designed to capture more than a few of these aspects. Whereas deep learning datasets focus on visually complex data but simple visual reasoning tasks, inductive logic datasets involve complex logical learning tasks, however, lack the visual component. To address this, we propose the diagnostic visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Train, - a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL-Train provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even SOTA AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations of each methodology. Overall, V-LoL opens up new avenues for understanding and enhancing current abilities in visual logical learning for AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689v3)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models. How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Unstructured Data to In-Context Learning: Exploring What Tasks Can Be Learned and When](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00131v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like transformers demonstrate impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, allowing them to make predictions for new tasks based on prompt exemplars without parameter updates. While existing ICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g., x-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on unstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks like word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models trained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements and training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities can emerge simply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured data; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through co-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms. However, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks requiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where ICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new, unseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs appear only in fixed training positions. These findings suggest that LLMs' ICL abilities depend heavily on the structural elements within their training data.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[Knowledge Authoring with Factual English, Rules, and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06253v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge representation and reasoning systems represent knowledge as collections of facts and rules. KRRs can represent complex concepts and relations, and they can query and manipulate information in sophisticated ways. Unfortunately, the KRR technology has been hindered by the fact that specifying the requisite knowledge requires skills that most domain experts do not have, and professional knowledge engineers are hard to find. Some recent CNL-based approaches, such as the Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine (KALM), have shown to have very high accuracy compared to others, and a natural question is to what extent the CNL restrictions can be lifted. Besides the CNL restrictions, KALM has limitations in terms of the types of knowledge it can represent. To address these issues, we propose an extension of KALM called KALM for Factual Language (KALMF). KALMF uses a neural parser for natural language, MS, to parse what we call factual English sentences, which require little grammar training to use. Building upon KALMF, we propose KALM for Rules and Actions (KALMR), to represent and reason with rules and actions. Furthermore, we identify the reasons behind the slow speed of KALM and make optimizations to address this issue. Our evaluation using multiple benchmarks shows that our approaches achieve a high level of correctness on fact and query authoring (95%) and on rule authoring (100%). When used for authoring and reasoning with actions, our approach achieves more than 99.3% correctness, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling more sophisticated knowledge representation and reasoning. We also illustrate the logical reasoning capabilities of our approach by drawing attention to the problems faced by the famous AI, ChatGPT. Finally, the evaluation of the newly proposed speed optimization points not only to a 68% runtime improvement but also yields better accuracy of the overall system.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

However, some suggest the excellence might be partially due to the model "memorizing" solutions, resulting in less satisfactory performance when prompted with problems not in the training data. We conduct a comparison experiment using two datasets: one consisting of International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) problems, which is easily accessible; the other one consisting of Chinese National Team Training camp (CNT) problems, which have similar difficulty but not as publically accessible. We label the response for each problem and compare the performance between the two datasets. We conclude that there is no significant evidence to show that the model relies on memorizing problems and solutions. Also, we perform case studies to analyze some features of the model's response.</p></details> |  |
