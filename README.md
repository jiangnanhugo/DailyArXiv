| **[An End-to-End Learning Approach for Solving Capacitated Location-Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02525v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve. With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants, while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper, we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP (OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and OCLRP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Untrained Message Passing Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTL-KD: Multi-Task Learning Via Knowledge Distillation for Generalizable Neural Vehicle Routing Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02935v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Investigation of Performance and Scalability of a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Optimizer (QIEO) on NVIDIA GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01298v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum inspired evolutionary optimization leverages quantum computing principles like superposition, interference, and probabilistic representation to enhance classical evolutionary algorithms with improved exploration and exploitation capabilities. Implemented on NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2 GPUs, this study systematically investigates the performance and scalability of a GPU-accelerated Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Optimizer applied to large scale 01 Knapsack problems. By exploiting CUDA`s parallel processing capabilities, particularly through optimized memory management and thread configuration, significant speedups and efficient utilization of GPU resources is demonstrated. The analysis covers various problem sizes, kernel launch configurations, and memory models including constant, shared, global, and pinned memory, alongside extensive scaling studies. The results reveal that careful tuning of memory strategies and kernel configurations is essential for maximizing throughput and efficiency, with constant memory providing superior performance up to hardware limits. Beyond these limits, global memory and strategic tiling become necessary, albeit with some performance trade offs. The findings highlight both the promise and the practical constraints of applying QIEO on GPUs for complex combinatorial optimization, offering actionable insights for future large scale metaheuristic implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at Super Computing India 2025 (SCI2025)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Maxflow Processing for Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01235v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Flow (Max-Flow) problem is a cornerstone in graph theory and combinatorial optimization, aiming to determine the largest possible flow from a designated source node to a sink node within a capacitated flow network. It has extensive applications across diverse domains such as computer networking, transportation systems, and image segmentation. The objective is to maximize the total throughput while respecting edge capacity constraints and maintaining flow conservation at all intermediate vertices. Among the various algorithms proposed for solving the Max-Flow problem, the Push--Relabel algorithm is particularly notable for its efficiency and suitability for parallelization, owing to its localized vertex-based operations. This property has motivated extensive research into GPU-accelerated Max-Flow computation, leveraging the high degree of parallelism inherent to modern GPU architectures. In this paper, we present a novel GPU-parallel Max-Flow algorithm capable of incrementally recomputing the maximum flow of a dynamic graph following a batch of edge updates. In addition, we introduce a high-performance static GPU algorithm designed for efficiently computing the initial Max-Flow on static graphs. We further describe a series of CUDA-specific implementation optimizations that enhance performance, scalability, and memory efficiency on GPU platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Credit Network Modeling and Analysis via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01136v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the application of large language models (LLMs) to construct credit networks from firms' textual financial statements and to analyze the resulting network structures. We start with using LLMs to translate each firm's financial statement into a credit network that pertains solely to that firm. These networks are then aggregated to form a comprehensive credit network representing the whole financial system. During this process, the inconsistencies in financial statements are automatically detected and human intervention is involved. We demonstrate that this translation process is effective across financial statements corresponding to credit networks with diverse topological structures. We further investigate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in analyzing credit networks and determining optimal strategies for executing financial operations to maximize network performance measured by the total assets of firms, which is an inherently combinatorial optimization challenge. To demonstrate this capability, we focus on two financial operations: portfolio compression and debt removal, applying them to both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our findings show that LLMs can generate coherent reasoning and recommend effective executions of these operations to enhance overall network performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Characterizing QUBO Reformulations of the Max-k-Cut Problem for Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01108v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers significant potential for solving NP-hard combinatorial (optimization) problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers. One way to tap into this potential is by reformulating combinatorial problems as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The solution of the QUBO reformulation can then be addressed using adiabatic quantum computing devices or appropriate quantum computing algorithms on gate-based quantum computing devices. In general, QUBO reformulations of combinatorial problems can be readily obtained by properly penalizing the violation of the problem's constraints in the original problem's objective. However, characterizing tight (i.e., minimal but sufficient) penalty coefficients for this purpose is critical for enabling the solution of the resulting QUBO in current and near-term quantum computing devices. Along these lines, we here focus on the (weighted) max $k$-cut problem, a fundamental combinatorial problem with wide-ranging applications that generalizes the well-known max cut problem. We present closed-form characterizations of tight penalty coefficients for two distinct QUBO reformulations of the max $k$-cut problem whose values depend on the (weighted) degree of the vertices of the graph defining the problem. These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to make quantum computing a viable tool for solving combinatorial problems at scale. We support our theoretical results with illustrative examples. Further, we benchmark the proposed QUBO reformulations to solve the max $k$-cut problem on a quantum computer simulator.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Fast Stochastic Greedy Algorithm for $k$-Submodular Cover Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00869v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the $k$-Submodular Cover ($kSC$) problem, a natural generalization of the classical Submodular Cover problem that arises in artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization tasks such as influence maximization, resource allocation, and sensor placement. Existing algorithms for $\kSC$ often provide weak approximation guarantees or incur prohibitively high query complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a \textit{Fast Stochastic Greedy} algorithm that achieves strong bicriteria approximation while substantially lowering query complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach dramatically reduces the number of function evaluations, making it highly scalable and practical for large-scale real-world AI applications where efficiency is essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Combinatorial Optimization of Design Structure Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex engineering systems, the dependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that rely solely on mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM sequencing-a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases demonstrate that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Non-Variational Quantum Approach to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26859v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problems with Different Constraint Tightness Degrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24627v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various constraint tightness degrees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Generalization of Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problems via Test-Time Projection Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02392v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data, rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.24627</p></details> |
| **[On the Dataless Training of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25962v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless application of neural network architectures in optimization by re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional, graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key (possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN) settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Algorithms for Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24039v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19053v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of combinatorial action spaces. We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a novel actor-critic paradigm that embeds combinatorial optimization-layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope. Across six environments with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty, SRL matches or surpasses the performance of unstructured RL and imitation learning on static tasks and improves over these baselines by up to 92% on dynamic problems, with improved stability and convergence speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, accepted at the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23419v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MOOSE-Chem2: Exploring LLM Limits in Fine-Grained Scientific Hypothesis Discovery via Hierarchical Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19209v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Transformation Invariant Geometric Deep Learning: An Initial Representation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12345v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in the last decade. When designing neural networks to handle the ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, it is critical that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Most existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. In this paper, we revisit why general neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general plug-in for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling and feed the representations into existing neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method. We also extend our method into equivariance cases. Based on the results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered as an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |
| **[Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. II. Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed. In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers. Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularized Langevin Dynamics for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00277v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a simple yet effective sampling framework for combinatorial optimization (CO). Our method builds on discrete Langevin dynamics (LD), an efficient gradient-guided generative paradigm. However, we observe that directly applying LD often leads to limited exploration. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Regularized Langevin Dynamics (RLD), which enforces an expected distance between the sampled and current solutions, effectively avoiding local minima. We develop two CO solvers on top of RLD, one based on simulated annealing (SA), and the other one based on neural network (NN). Empirical results on three classic CO problems demonstrate that both of our methods can achieve comparable or better performance against the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) SA- and NN-based solvers. In particular, our SA algorithm reduces the runtime of the previous SOTA SA method by up to 80\%, while achieving equal or superior performance. In summary, RLD offers a promising framework for enhancing both traditional heuristics and NN models to solve CO problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shengyu-Feng/RLD4CO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Complexity Scaling Laws for Neural Models using Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12932v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 46 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |
| **[Probing Neural Combinatorial Optimization Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22131v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance, yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing (CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights for the NCO community.

| **[Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural TSP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21693v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique, to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

| **[A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response, enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA, routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm, requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10 seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 8 figures,9 tables</p></details> |

While this generalizes the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards. Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in time, with strong theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Adaptive Non-uniform Timestep Sampling for Accelerating Diffusion Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09998v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.</p></details> |  |

GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions. For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance, GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances where classical exact methods become infeasible.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Optimizing Feature Ordering in Radar Charts for Multi-Profile Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20738v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness'' across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial (exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity, practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement. Keywords: data visualization, radar charts, combinatorial optimization, minimax optimization, feature ordering</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 0-1 Integer Programs with Unknown Knapsack Constraints Using Membership Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14090v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with unknown knapsack constraints using a membership oracle for each unknown constraint such that, given a solution, the oracle determines whether the constraint is satisfied or not with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning for binary classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we devise a framework to solve the problem by learning and exploiting surrogate linear constraints. The framework includes training linear separators on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, a natural choice would be SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin, for each unknown constraint. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on classical problems and variants inspired by realistic applications to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of several metrics including objective value, dual bound and running time.</p></details> |  |

These approaches require sending messages of unlimited size, so they do not extend to the CONGEST model, which restricts the message size to be $O(\log n)$ bits. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for obtaining $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$-round $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for many combinatorial optimization problems, including maximum weighted matching, maximum independent set, and correlation clustering, in graphs excluding a fixed minor in the CONGEST model. This class of graphs covers many sparse network classes that have been studied in the literature, including planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, and bounded-treewidth graphs. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be applied to give an efficient distributed property testing algorithm for an arbitrary minor-closed graph property that is closed under taking disjoint union, significantly generalizing the previous distributed property testing algorithm for planarity in [Levi, Medina, and Ron, PODC 2018 & Distributed Computing 2021]. Our framework uses distributed expander decomposition algorithms [Chang and Saranurak, FOCS 2020] to decompose the graph into clusters of high conductance. We show that any graph excluding a fixed minor admits small edge separators. Using this result, we show the existence of a high-degree vertex in each cluster in an expander decomposition, which allows the entire graph topology of the cluster to be routed to a vertex. Similar to the use of network decompositions in the LOCAL model, the vertex will be able to perform any local computation on the subgraph induced by the cluster and broadcast the result over the cluster.</p></details> |  |

While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 ma...</summary><p>13 main pages, 6 main figures. 4 supplementary pages, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[A Probabilistic Computing Approach to the Closest Vector Problem for Lattice-Based Factoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19390v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The closest vector problem (CVP) is a fundamental optimization problem in lattice-based cryptography and its conjectured hardness underpins the security of lattice-based cryptosystems. Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring algorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems, including RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a heuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring algorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic optimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a hardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial optimization. In this work we investigate the application of probabilistic computing to the heuristic optimization task of CVP approximation refinement in lattice-based factoring. We present the design of a probabilistic computing algorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and experimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for solving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based factoring. The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding the maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem size and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice parameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number using up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical methods.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Network Prebunking Problem: Optimizing Prebunking Targets to Suppress the Spread of Misinformation in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01124v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as \textit{prebunking} has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the \textit{network prebunking problem}, which aims to select optimal prebunking targets that minimizes the spread of misinformation in a social network under limited intervention budgets. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that its objective function is monotone and submodular, which provides a theoretical foundation for approximation guarantees of greedy algorithms. However, since the greedy algorithm is computationally expensive and does not scale to large networks, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</p></details> |  |

A key factor influencing the performance of B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions. Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics. Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalization, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose PARCO (Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization), a general reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key novel components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities. We evaluate PARCO in multi-agent vehicle routing and scheduling problems, where our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods, demonstrating strong generalization ability and remarkable computational efficiency.

Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and computer science applications.

In this context, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem for a mode-switching discrete-phase shifters simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided multi-antenna access point network, emphasizing hardware efficiency and reduced cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear optimization framework is formulated for joint optimization of the active beamforming matrix, user power allocation, and STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, including binary transmission/reflection amplitudes and discrete phase shifters. To solve the formulated problem, we employ a block coordinate descent method, dividing it into three subproblems tackled using difference-of-concave programming and combinatorial optimization techniques. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization approach, consistently achieving superior sum rate performance compared to partial optimization methods, thereby underscoring its potential for efficient and scalable 6G IoT systems.</p></details> | accepted by IEEE WCL |

This setting arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions. This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 19 figures, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme that obtains provably near-optimal solutions, building on the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. For a given $n \times m$ semi-orthogonal matrix, we derive a purely multiplicative approximation ratio for our algorithm, and show that it is never worse than $\max(2/(\pi m), 1/(\pi(\log (2m)+1)))$. We also show how to compute a tighter constant for a finite $(n,m)$ by solving a univariate optimization problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Overh...</summary><p>Overhauled approximation algorithm in orthogonally constrained case; now guarantee is purely multiplicative and logarithmic in number of columns</p></details> |

These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework.

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</p></details> |  |

The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Despite strong empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and the ability to learn coordinated behavior. We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries, we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared to standard self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thin Trees via $k$-Respecting Cut Identities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12050v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thin spanning trees lie at the intersection of graph theory, approximation algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. They are central to the long-standing \emph{thin tree conjecture}, which asks whether every $k$-edge-connected graph contains an $O(1/k)$-thin tree, and they underpin algorithmic breakthroughs such as the $O(\log n/\log\log n)$-approximation for ATSP. Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \emph{verifying} that a given tree is thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about exponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known. We introduce a new machinery of \emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which express the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$ edges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a tree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in $O_k(1)$ time. Building on this oracle, we give the first procedure to compute the exact $k$-thinness certificate $\Theta_k(T)$ of any spanning tree for fixed $k$ in time $\tilde O(n^2+n^k)$, outputting both the certificate value and a witnessing cut. Beyond general graphs, our framework yields sharper guarantees in structured settings. In planar graphs, duality with cycles and dual girth imply that every spanning tree admits a verifiable certificate $\Theta_k(T)\le k/\lambda$ (hence $O(1/\lambda)$ for constant $k$). In graphs embedded on a surface of genus $\gamma$, refined counting gives certified (per-cut) bounds $O((\log n+\gamma)/\lambda)$ via the same ensemble coverage.</p></details> |  |

Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization.

| **[Hot-Starting Quantum Portfolio Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11153v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization with a smooth and convex objective function arises naturally in applications such as discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization, where assets must be traded in integer quantities. Although optimal solutions to the associated smooth problem can be computed efficiently, existing adiabatic quantum optimization methods cannot leverage this information. Moreover, while various warm-starting strategies have been proposed for gate-based quantum optimization, none of them explicitly integrate insights from the relaxed continuous solution into the QUBO formulation. In this work, a novel approach is introduced that restricts the search space to discrete solutions in the vicinity of the continuous optimum by constructing a compact Hilbert space, thereby reducing the number of required qubits. Experiments on software solvers and a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17200v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent line of structured learning methods has advanced the practical state-of-the-art for combinatorial optimization problems with complex, application-specific objectives. These approaches learn policies that couple a statistical model with a tractable surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle, so as to exploit the distribution of problem instances instead of solving each instance independently. A core obstacle is that the empirical risk is then piecewise constant in the model parameters. This hinders gradient-based optimization and only few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. We address this issue by analyzing smoothed (perturbed) policies: adding controlled random perturbations to the direction used by the linear oracle yields a differentiable surrogate risk and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that decomposes the excess risk into perturbation bias, statistical estimation error, and optimization error. The analysis hinges on a new Uniform Weak (UW) property capturing the geometric interaction between the statistical model and the normal fan of the feasible polytope; we show it holds under mild assumptions, and automatically when a minimal baseline perturbation is present. The framework covers, in particular, contextual stochastic optimization. We illustrate the scope of the results on applications such as stochastic vehicle scheduling, highlighting how smoothing enables both tractable training and controlled generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main document, 3 pages supplement.

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO, a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, code available in https://github.com/jsalvasoler/difusco_ddea</p></details> |
| **[Lagrange Oscillatory Neural Networks for Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07179v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-inspired computing paradigms are receiving renewed attention to enhance efficiency in compute-intensive tasks such as artificial intelligence and optimization. Similar to Hopfield neural networks, oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) minimize an Ising energy function that embeds the solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite their success in solving unconstrained optimization problems, Ising machines still face challenges with constrained problems as they can become trapped in infeasible local minima. In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange ONN (LagONN) designed to escape infeasible states based on the theory of Lagrange multipliers. Unlike existing oscillatory Ising machines, LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to guide the system towards feasible states in an augmented energy landscape, settling only when constraints are met. Taking the maximum satisfiability problem with three literals as a use case (Max-3-SAT), we harness LagONN's constraint satisfaction mechanism to find optimal solutions for random SATlib instances with up to 200 variables and 860 clauses, which provides a deterministic alternative to simulated annealing for coupled oscillators. We benchmark LagONN with SAT solvers and further discuss the potential of Lagrange oscillators to address other constraints, such as phase copying, which is useful in oscillatory Ising machines with limited connectivity.</p></details> |  |

The framework consists of three sequential stages: broad exploration of the parameter space, exploitation of top-performing parameters, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess the reliability of results. As a case study, we apply ACO to the TSPLIB berlin52 dataset, which has a known optimal tour length of 7542. Using our framework, we calculate that the probability of ACO finding the global optimum is approximately 1/40 in a single run and improves to 1/5 when aggregated over ten runs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHARME: A chain-based reinforcement learning approach for the minor embedding problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07124v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) has great potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolyNet: Learning Diverse Solution Strategies for Neural Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14048v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based methods for constructing solutions to combinatorial optimization problems are rapidly approaching the performance of human-designed algorithms. To further narrow the gap, learning-based approaches must efficiently explore the solution space during the search process. Recent approaches artificially increase exploration by enforcing diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules, however, these rules can impair solution quality and are difficult to design for more complex problems. In this paper, we introduce PolyNet, an approach for improving exploration of the solution space by learning complementary solution strategies. In contrast to other works, PolyNet uses only a single-decoder and a training schema that does not enforce diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules. We evaluate PolyNet on four combinatorial optimization problems and observe that the implicit diversity mechanism allows PolyNet to find better solutions than approaches that explicitly enforce diverse solution generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Streaming Max-Cut in General Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04435v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Max-Cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that has been studied in various computational settings. In this work, we initiate the study of its streaming complexity in general metric spaces with access to distance oracles. We give a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for estimating the Max-Cut value sliding-window streams using only poly-logarithmic space. This is the first sliding-window algorithm for Max-Cut even in Euclidean spaces, and it achieves a similar error-space tradeoff as the state-of-the-art insertion-only algorithms in Euclidean settings [Chen, Jiang, Krauthgamer, STOC'23], but without relying on Euclidean structures. In sharp contrast, we prove a polynomial-space lower bound for any $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-approximation in the dynamic streaming setting. This yields a separation from the Euclidean case, where the polylogarithmic-space $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation extends to dynamic streams. On the technical side, our sliding-window algorithm builds on the smooth histogram framework of [Braverman and Ostrovsky, SICOMP'10]. To make this framework applicable, we establish the first smoothness bound for metric Max-Cut. Moreover, we develop a streaming algorithm for metric Max-Cut in insertion-only streams, whose key ingredient is a new metric reservoir sampling technique.</p></details> |  |

CVRP plays an essential position in logistics systems, and it is the most intensively studied problem in combinatorial optimization. In complexity, CVRP with k $\ge$ 3 is an NP-hard problem, and it is APX-hard as well. We already knew that it could not be approximated in metric space. Moreover, it is the first problem resisting Arora's famous approximation framework. So, whether there is, a polynomial-time (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation for the Euclidean CVRP for any $\epsilon>0$ is still an open problem. This paper will summarize the research progress from history to up-to-date developments. The survey will be updated periodically.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[MG2FlowNet: Accelerating High-Reward Sample Generation via Enhanced MCTS and Greediness Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00805v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at https://github.com/ZRNB/MG2FlowNet.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83.

| **[Short circuit walks in fixed dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01916v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit augmentation schemes are a family of combinatorial algorithms for linear programming that generalize the simplex method. To solve the linear program, they construct a so-called monotone circuit walk: They start at an initial vertex of the feasible region and traverse a discrete sequence of points on the boundary, while moving along certain allowed directions (circuits) and improving the objective function at each step until reaching an optimum. Since the existence of short circuit walks has been conjectured (Circuit Diameter Conjecture), several works have investigated how well one can efficiently approximate shortest monotone circuit walks towards an optimum. A first result addressing this question was given by De Loera, Kafer, and Sanit\`a [SIAM J. Opt., 2022], who showed that given as input an LP and the starting vertex, finding a $2$-approximation for this problem is NP-hard. Cardinal and the third author [Math. Prog. 2023] gave a stronger lower bound assuming the exponential time hypothesis, showing that even an approximation factor of $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ is intractable for LPs defined by $m$ inequalities. Both of these results were based on reductions from highly degenerate polytopes in combinatorial optimization with high dimension. In this paper, we significantly strengthen the aforementioned hardness results by showing that for every fixed $\varepsilon>0$ approximating the problem on polygons with $m$ edges to within a factor of $O(m^{1-\varepsilon})$ is NP-hard. This result is essentially best-possible, as it cannot be improved beyond $o(m)$. In particular, this implies hardness for simple polytopes and in fixed dimension.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization with Order-Invariant Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01824v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs, which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies, improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Configuration Allocation in Pre-Production Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05147v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments. Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.</p></details> |  |

The resulting circuit is composed of a polynomial number of Pauli rotations without ancilla qubit. Extending this result, we prove that for sufficiently large qubit number, any quantum state can be approximately prepared with a constant (polynomial) number of Pauli rotations to constant (inverse-polynomial) precision. Our theoretical findings reveal exponential quantum advantages in the prominent applications: ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lower Bound for the Max Entropy Algorithm for TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01950v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most famous conjectures in combinatorial optimization is the four-thirds conjecture, which states that the integrality gap of the subtour LP relaxation of the TSP is equal to $\frac43$. For 40 years, the best known upper bound was 1.5, due to Wolsey (1980). Recently, Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan (2022) showed that the max entropy algorithm for the TSP gives an improved bound of $1.5 - 10^{-36}$. In this paper, we show that the approximation ratio of the max entropy algorithm is at least 1.375, even for graphic TSP. Thus the max entropy algorithm does not appear to be the algorithm that will ultimately resolve the four-thirds conjecture in the affirmative, should that be possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Census Data Generation via Multidimensional Multiset Sum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The US Decennial Census provides valuable data for both research and policy purposes. Census data are subject to a variety of disclosure avoidance techniques prior to release in order to preserve respondent confidentiality. While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by a critical lack of data: The underlying "microdata," which serve as necessary input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting. While the problem we study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance. Finally, we verify that the data we produce are "close" to the desired ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to enhance their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal and is under review</p></details> |

Building on recent advances in optimizing such discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its $L_\infty$ counterpart.</p></details> |  |

The focus is on enhancing radar sensing performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 14 figures.

In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |

We model the observed outcome vector as a partially observed latent realization from a multivariate linear regression model. Our goal is to estimate simultaneously a sparse matrix ($B$) of latent regression coefficients (i.e., partial covariate effects) and a sparse latent residual precision matrix ($\Omega$), which induces partial correlations between the observed outcomes. To this end, we specify continuous spike-and-slab priors on all entries of $B$ and off-diagonal elements of $\Omega$ and introduce a Monte Carlo Expectation-Conditional Maximization algorithm to compute the maximum a posterior estimate of the model parameters. Under a set of mild assumptions, we derive the posterior contraction rate for our model in the high-dimensional regimes where both $p$ and $q$ diverge with the sample size $n$ and establish a sure screening property, which implies that, as $n$ increases, we can recover all truly non-zero elements of $B$ with probability tending to one. We demonstrate the excellent finite-sample properties of our proposed method, which we call mixed-mSSL, using extensive simulation studies and three applications spanning medicine to ecology.</p></details> |  |

The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Copula-Based Outage Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems: Channel Coefficient- or Envelope-Level Correlation Matrix?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09411v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian copula has been employed to evaluate the outage performance of Fluid Antenna Systems (FAS), with the covariance matrix reflecting the dependence among multivariate normal random variables (RVs). While prior studies approximate this matrix using the channel coefficient correlation matrix from Jake's model, this work instead employs the channel envelope correlation matrix, motivated by the fact that the multivariate normal RVs are generated by transforming correlated channel envelopes. This raises an open question of whether using the coefficient- or envelope-level correlation matrix yields better accuracy in accessing FAS performance. Toward this end, this paper explores the benefits of using the envelope-level correlation matrix under fully correlated Nakagami-m fading, and develops a method for generating such fading channels for Monte Carlo simulations, which serve as a benchmark for validating the theoretical results. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed channel modeling approach and demonstrate the superior accuracy of using the envelope-level correlation matrix, particularly in sparse port deployment and low-outage regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-vs-Many Missile Guidance via Virtual Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02526v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using virtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory predictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets through conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a centralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing probabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is guided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse flight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal interception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as many-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by distributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than pursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across various target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors) demonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line prediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to 5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable effective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing interception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics as Technical Note</p></details> |

The proposed GSC framework generalizes the definition of Grid-Forming (GFM) control schemes and exploits the coupling between active and reactive power dynamics. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct extensive time-domain simulations and small-signal analysis using a modified version of the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus dynamic model of the all-island Irish transmission system. The case studies focus on evaluating the dynamic performance of the proposed framework under different configurations, including Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM), coupled-VSM and dual-VSM schemes. To address the nonlinear nature of power system dynamics, sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo methods are employed to improve parameter tuning and assess the stability of GSC configurations in the studied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Multi-UAV 3D Deployment for Energy-Efficient Sensing over Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02368v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we consider a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative sensing system where UAVs are deployed to sense multiple targets in terrain-aware line of sight (LoS) conditions in uneven terrain equipped with directional antennas. To mitigate terrain-induced LoS blockages that degrade detection performance, we incorporate a binary LoS indicator and propose a bounding volume hierarchy (BHV)-based adaptive scheme for efficient LoS evaluation. We formulate a bi-objective problem that maximizes the probability of cooperative detection with minimal hover energy constraints governing spatial, orientational, and safety constraints. To address the problem, which is inherently non-convex, we propose a hierarchical heuristic framework that combines exploration through a genetic algorithm (GA) with per-UAV refinement via particle swarm optimization (PSO), where a penalty-based fitness evaluation guides solutions toward feasibility, bounded within constraints. The proposed methodology is an effective trade-off method of traversing through a complex search space and maintaining terrain-aware LoS connectivity and energy aware deployment. Monte Carlo simulations on real-world terrain data show that the proposed GA+PSO framework improves detection probability by 37.02% and 36.5% for 2 and 3 UAVs, respectively, while reducing average excess hover energy by 45.0% and 48.9% compared to the PSO-only baseline. Relative to the non-optimized scheme, it further achieves 59.5% and 54.2% higher detection probability with 59.8% and 65.9% lower excess hover energy, thereby showing its effectiveness with a small number of UAVs over uneven terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in part for presentation at IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC), Las Vegas, USA, Jan. 2026. 6 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

| **[Explainable Graph Neural Architecture Search via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (Full version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15734v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of graph neural network (GNN) architectures has increased rapidly due to the growing adoption of graph analysis. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate modeling of Cellular-Potts Agent-Based Models as a segmentation task using the U-Net neural network architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00316v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Mechanisms from Heterogeneous Effects: An Identification Strategy for Mediation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04131v6)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal mechanisms is crucial for explaining and generalizing empirical phenomena. Causal mediation analysis offers statistical techniques to quantify the mediation effects. Although numerous methods have been developed for causal inference more broadly, the methodological toolkit for causal mediation analysis remains limited. Current methods often require multiple ignorability assumptions or sophisticated research designs. In this paper, we introduce an alternative identification strategy that enables the simultaneous identification and estimation of treatment and mediation effects. By combining explicit and implicit mediation analysis, this strategy leverages heterogeneous treatment effects and does not require addressing some unobserved confounders. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the method is more accurate and precise across various scenarios. To illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method, we apply it to estimate the causal mediation effects in two studies with distinct data structures, focusing on common pool resource governance and voting information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of Beam Misalignment Effect in Inter-Satellite FSO Links](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02189v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology for inter-satellite links (ISLs) due to its high data rate, low power consumption, and reduced interference. However, the performance of inter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While pointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness of PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment hardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and misalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation with a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis more practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo simulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite FSO systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC)</p></details> |
| **[Variance-Bounded Evaluation of Entity-Centric AI Systems Without Ground Truth: Theory and Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22751v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable evaluation of AI systems remains a fundamental challenge when ground truth labels are unavailable, particularly for systems generating natural language outputs like AI chat and agent systems. Many of these AI agents and systems focus on entity-centric tasks. In enterprise contexts, organizations deploy AI systems for entity linking, data integration, and information retrieval where verification against gold standards is often infeasible due to proprietary data constraints. Academic deployments face similar challenges when evaluating AI systems on specialized datasets with ambiguous criteria. Conventional evaluation frameworks, rooted in supervised learning paradigms, fail in such scenarios where single correct answers cannot be defined. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation framework for entity-centric AI systems that operates without ground truth by jointly measuring effectiveness and robustness. Given system inputs, VB-Score enumerates plausible interpretations through constraint relaxation and Monte Carlo sampling, assigning probabilities that reflect their likelihood. It then evaluates system outputs by their expected success across interpretations, penalized by variance to assess robustness of the system. We provide formal theoretical analysis establishing key properties including range, monotonicity, and stability along with concentration bounds for Monte Carlo estimation. Through case studies on AI systems with ambiguous inputs, we demonstrate that VB-Score reveals robustness differences hidden by conventional evaluation frameworks, offering a principled measurement framework for assessing AI system reliability in label-scarce domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v6)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Change-in-velocity detection for multidimensional data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27150v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce CPLASS (Continuous Piecewise-Linear Approximation via Stochastic Search), an algorithm for detecting changes in velocity within multidimensional data. The one-dimensional version of this problem is known as the change-in-slope problem (see Fearnhead & Grose (2022), Baranowski et al. (2019)). Unlike traditional changepoint detection methods that focus on changes in mean, detecting changes in velocity requires a specialized approach due to continuity constraints and parameter dependencies, which frustrate popular algorithms like binary segmentation and dynamic programming. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a specialized penalty function to balance improvements in likelihood due to model complexity, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based approach with tailored proposal mechanisms for efficient parameter exploration. Our method is particularly suited for analyzing intracellular transport data, where the multidimensional trajectories of microscale cargo are driven by teams of molecular motors that undergo complex biophysical transitions. To ensure biophysical realism in the results, we introduce a speed penalty that discourages overfitted of short noisy segments while maintaining consistency in the large-sample limit. Additionally, we introduce a summary statistic called the Cumulative Speed Allocation, which is robust with respect to idiosyncracies of changepoint detection while maintaining the ability to discriminate between biophysically distinct populations.</p></details> |  |

The method is applied to the generation of Compton Form Factors for simulation and analysis of nuclear femtography, as enabled by high energy exclusive processes such as electron-proton scattering producing just an electron, proton, and gamma-ray in the final state. While producing tessellations with only a 1% mean interpolation error, our results show that the use of such tessellations can significantly decrease the computation time for Monte Carlo event generation by $\sim23$ times for $10^{7}$ events (and using extrapolation, by $\sim955$ times for $10^{10}$ events).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sufficient conditions for QMC analysis of finite elements for parametric differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01703v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parametric regularity of discretizations of flux vector fields satisfying a balance law is studied under some assumptions on a random parameter that links the flux with an unknown primal variable (often through a constitutive law). In the primary example of the stationary diffusion equation, the parameter corresponds to the inverse of the diffusivity. The random parameter is modeled here as a Gevrey-regular random field. Specific focus is on random fields expressible as functions of countably infinite sequences of independent random variables, which may be uniformly or normally distributed. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) error bounds for some quantity of interest that depends on the flux are then derived using the parametric regularity. It is shown that the QMC method converges optimally if the quantity of interest depends continuously on the primal variable, its flux, or its gradient. A series of assumptions are introduced with the goal of encompassing a broad class of discretizations by various finite element methods. The assumptions are verified for the diffusion equation discretized using conforming finite elements, mixed methods, and hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin schemes. Numerical experiments confirm the analytical findings, highlighting the role of accurate flux approximation in QMC methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solution Space Topology Guides CMTS Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01701v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental question in search-guided AI: what topology should guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in puzzle solving? Prior work applied topological features to guide MCTS in ARC-style tasks using grid topology -- the Laplacian spectral properties of cell connectivity -- and found no benefit. We identify the root cause: grid topology is constant across all instances. We propose measuring \emph{solution space topology} instead: the structure of valid color assignments constrained by detected pattern rules. We build this via compatibility graphs where nodes are $(cell, color)$ pairs and edges represent compatible assignments under pattern constraints. Our method: (1) detect pattern rules automatically with 100\% accuracy on 5 types, (2) construct compatibility graphs encoding solution space structure, (3) extract topological features (algebraic connectivity, rigidity, color structure) that vary with task difficulty, (4) integrate these features into MCTS node selection via sibling-normalized scores. We provide formal definitions, a rigorous selection formula, and comprehensive ablations showing that algebraic connectivity is the dominant signal. The work demonstrates that topology matters for search -- but only the \emph{right} topology. For puzzle solving, this is solution space structure, not problem space structure.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Sampling by averaging: A multiscale approach to score estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15069v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex, unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics. Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework: MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff, based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics. Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and efficiency, without the need for learned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-Adapted Neural Network Wavefunctions in Real Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01671v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin plays a fundamental role in understanding electronic structure, yet many real-space wavefunction methods fail to adequately consider it. We introduce the Spin-Adapted Antisymmetrization Method (SAAM), a general procedure that enforces exact total spin symmetry for antisymmetric many-electron wavefunctions in real space. In the context of neural network-based quantum Monte Carlo (NNQMC), SAAM leverages the expressiveness of deep neural networks to capture electron correlation while enforcing exact spin adaptation via group representation theory. This framework provides a principled route to embed physical priors into otherwise black-box neural network wavefunctions, yielding a compact representation of correlated system with neural network orbitals. Compared with existing treatments of spin in NNQMC, SAAM is more accurate and efficient, achieving exact spin purity without any additional tunable hyperparameters. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply SAAM to study the spin ladder of iron-sulfur clusters, a long-standing challenge for many-body methods due to their dense spectrum of nearly degenerate spin states. Our results reveal accurate resolution of low-lying spin states and spin gaps in [Fe$_2$S$_2$] and [Fe$_4$S$_4$] clusters, offering new insights into their electronic structures. In sum, these findings establish SAAM as a robust, hyperparameter-free standard for spin-adapted NNQMC, particularly for strongly correlated systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[$L_2$-approximation using median lattice algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15331v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the problem of multivariate $L_2$-approximation of functions belonging to a weighted Korobov space. We propose and analyze a median lattice-based algorithm, inspired by median integration rules, which have attracted significant attention in the theory of quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Our algorithm approximates the Fourier coefficients associated with a suitably chosen frequency index set, where each coefficient is estimated by taking the median over approximations from randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules with independently chosen generating vectors. We prove that the algorithm achieves, with high probability, a convergence rate of the $L_2$-approximation error that is arbitrarily close to optimal with respect to the number of function evaluations. Furthermore, we show that the error bound depends only polynomially on the dimension, or is even independent of the dimension, under certain summability conditions on the weights. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed median lattice-based algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification of wave propagation and scattering problems modelled by the Helmholtz equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12451v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyse and implement a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) finite element method (FEM) for the forward problem of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for the Helmholtz equation with random coefficients, both in the second-order and zero-order terms of the equation, thus modelling wave scattering in random media. The problem is formulated on the infinite propagation domain, after scattering by the heterogeneity, and also (possibly) a bounded impenetrable scatterer. The spatial discretization scheme includes truncation to a bounded domain via a perfectly matched layer (PML) technique and then FEM approximation. A special case is the problem of an incident plane wave being scattered by a bounded sound-soft impenetrable obstacle surrounded by a random heterogeneous medium, or more simply, just scattering by the random medium. The random coefficients are assumed to be affine separable expansions with infinitely many independent uniformly distributed and bounded random parameters. As quantities of interest for the UQ, we consider the expectation of general linear functionals of the solution, with a special case being the far-field pattern of the scattered field. The numerical method consists of (a) dimension truncation in parameter space, (b) application of an adapted QMC method to compute expected values, and (c) computation of samples of the PDE solution via PML truncation and FEM approximation. Our error estimates are explicit in $s$ (the dimension truncation parameter), $N$ (the number of QMC points), $h$ (the FEM grid size) and (most importantly), $k$ (the Helmholtz wavenumber). The method is also exponentially accurate with respect to the PML truncation radius. Illustrative numerical experiments are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[Numerically Efficient and Stable Algorithms for Kernel-Based Regularized System Identification Using Givens-Vector Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01534v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerically efficient and stable algorithms are essential for kernel-based regularized system identification. The state of art algorithms exploit the semiseparable structure of the kernel and are based on the generator representation of the kernel matrix. However, as will be shown from both the theory and the practice, the algorithms based on the generator representation are sometimes numerically unstable, which limits their application in practice. This paper aims to address this issue by deriving and exploiting an alternative Givens-vector representation of some widely used kernel matrices. Based on the Givens-vector representation, we derive algorithms that yield more accurate results than existing algorithms without sacrificing efficiency. We demonstrate their usage for the kernel-based regularized system identification. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithms admit the same order of computational complexity as the state-of-the-art ones based on generator representation, but without issues with numerical stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Non-Terrestrial Network Performance with Free Space Optical Links and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01484v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which include high altitude platform (HAP) stations and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) into communication infrastructures has become a crucial area of research to address the increasing requirements for connectivity and performance in the post-5G era. This paper presents a comprehensive performance study of a new NTN architecture, which enables communication from the optical ground station (OGS) to end users through the utilization of HAP and terrestrial IRS nodes. In this configuration, the HAP acts as an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay terminal between the free-space optical (FSO) link and the RF links. Specifically, the RF links are modeled using the Shadowed Rician and the generalized Nakagami-$m$ models, where the FSO link is characterized by the Gamma-Gamma distribution with generalized pointing errors. The FSO system operates under either intensity modulation with direct detection or heterodyne detection. Using the mixture Gamma model, we approximate the non-centered chi-square distribution that describes the total fading of the RF link, and we assess the performance of the end-to-end system by analyzing the ergodic capacity, the average bit-error rate (BER), and the outage probability, calculated using the bivariate Fox-H function. We also provide simple asymptotic expressions for the average BER and the outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, the proposed analysis is validated with numerical and Monte-Carlo simulation results, showing an exact match.</p></details> |  |
| **[bayesCureRateModel: Bayesian Cure Rate Modeling for Time to Event Data in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10221v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of cure models provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously model both the proportion of cured subjects (those not facing the event of interest) and the distribution function of time-to-event for susceptibles (those facing the event). In practice, the application of cure models is mainly facilitated by the availability of various R packages. However, most of these packages primarily focus on the mixture or promotion time cure rate model. This article presents a fully Bayesian approach implemented in R to estimate a general family of cure rate models in the presence of covariates. It builds upon the work by Papastamoulis and Milienos (2024) by additionally considering various options for describing the promotion time, including the Weibull, exponential, Gompertz, log-logistic and finite mixtures of gamma distributions, among others. Moreover, the user can choose any proper distribution function for modeling the promotion time (provided that some specific conditions are met). Posterior inference is carried out by constructing a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, which combines Gibbs sampling for the latent cure indicators and Metropolis-Hastings steps with Langevin diffusion dynamics for parameter updates. The main MCMC algorithm is embedded within a parallel tempering scheme by considering heated versions of the target posterior distribution. The package is illustrated on a real dataset analyzing the duration of the first marriage under the presence of various covariates such as the race, age and the presence of kids.</p></details> | revised version |
| **[Understanding and Using the Relative Importance Measures Based on Orthogonalization and Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13389v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A class of relative importance measures based on orthogonalization and reallocation, ORMs, has been found to effectively approximate the General Dominance index (GD). In particular, Johnson's Relative Weight (RW) has been deemed the most successful ORM in the literature. Nevertheless, the theoretical foundation of the ORMs remains unclear. To further understand the ORMs, we provide a generalized framework that breaks down the ORM into two functional steps: orthogonalization and reallocation. To assess the impact of each step on the performance of ORMs, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations under various predictors' correlation structures and response variable distributions. Our findings reveal that Johnson's minimal transformation consistently outperforms other common orthogonalization methods. We also summarize the performance of reallocation methods under four scenarios of predictors' correlation structures in terms of the first principal component and the variance inflation factor (VIF).

| **[Spherical Point Process with Random Heights: New Approach for Modeling and Analysis of Downlink Satellite Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03343v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite industry is undergoing rapid expansion, with operators competitively launching satellites due to the first-come, first-served principle governing orbital rights. This has led to the formation of increasingly large-scale, volumetric constellation where satellites operate across a diverse range of altitudes. To address the need for analyzing such complex networks, this paper establishes a new analytical framework for LEO constellations by leveraging a 3D Poisson point process (PPP). Specifically, we introduce a random height model (RHM) that can capture various altitude distributions by applying a random radial displacement to points generated by a homogeneous PPP on a nominal shell. Building on this, we derive an analytical expression for the downlink coverage probability. To motivate our model, we show that the altitude distributions of several leading satellite constellations, including Starlink, align with our model's assumptions. We then demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations that the coverage probability of our RHM closely matches that of these real-world networks. Finally, we confirm the accuracy of our analytical expressions by showing their agreement with simulation results. Our work thereby provides a powerful tool for understanding and predict how the statistical distribution of satellite altitudes impacts network performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Characterizing the Effects of Environmental Exposures on Social Mobility: Bayesian Semi-parametrics for Principal Stratification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00311v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the causal effects of air pollution exposures on social mobility is attracting increasing attention. At the same time, education is widely recognized as a key driver of social mobility. However, the causal pathways linking fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, educational attainment, and social mobility remain largely unexplored. To address this, we adopt the principal stratification approach, which rigorously defines causal effects when a post-treatment variable--educational attainment--is affected by exposure--PM2.5--and may, in turn, affect the primary outcome--social mobility. To estimate the causal effects, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric method leveraging infinite mixtures for modeling the primary outcome. The proposed method (i) allows flexible modeling of the distribution of the primary potential outcomes, (ii) improves the accuracy of counterfactual imputation--a fundamental problem in causal inference framework--, and (iii) enables the characterization of treatment effects across different values of the post-treatment variable. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through a Monte Carlo simulation study, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches. Finally, we apply our method to a national dataset of 3,009 counties in the United States to estimate the causal effect of PM2.5 on social mobility, taking into account educational attainment as a post-treatment variable. Our findings indicate that in counties where higher PM2.5 exposure significantly reduces educational attainment social mobility decreases by approximately 5% compared to counties with lower PM2.5 exposure. We also find that in counties where exposure to PM2.5 does not affect educational attainment, social mobility is reduced by approximately 2% hinting at the possibility of further, yet unexplored, pathways connecting air pollution and social mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Nonparametrics for Principal Stratification with Continuous Post-Treatment Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17669v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal stratification provides a causal inference framework for investigating treatment effects in the presence of a post-treatment variable. Principal strata play a key role in characterizing the treatment effect by identifying groups of units with the same or similar values for the potential post-treatment variable at all treatment levels. The literature has focused mainly on binary post-treatment variables. Few papers considered continuous post-treatment variables. In the presence of a continuous post-treatment, a challenge is how to identify and characterize meaningful coarsening of the latent principal strata that lead to interpretable principal causal effects. This paper introduces the Confounders-Aware SHared atoms BAyesian mixture (CASBAH), a novel approach for principal stratification with binary treatment and continuous post-treatment variables. CASBAH leverages Bayesian nonparametric priors with an innovative hierarchical structure for the potential post-treatment outcomes that overcomes some of the limitations of previous works. Specifically, the novel features of our method allow for (i) identifying coarsened principal strata through a data-adaptive approach and (ii) providing a comprehensive quantification of the uncertainty surrounding stratum membership. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed methodology performs better than existing methods in characterizing the principal strata and estimating principal effects of the treatment. Finally, CASBAH is applied to a case study in which we estimate the causal effects of US national air quality regulations on pollution levels and health outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of Random Batch Method with replacement for interacting particle systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19315v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Random Batch Method (RBM) proposed in [Jin et al. J Comput Phys, 2020] is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems (IPS). In this paper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which is the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise interacting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly picks a small batch of size $p \ll N$, and only the particles in the picked batch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the weak interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is replaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one repeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an unbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting particle system. We give a rigorous proof of this approximation with an explicit convergence rate. In detail, we show that the Wasserstein-2 distance between first marginal distributions of IPS and RBM-r has an $O(\kappa^{1/4})$ upper bound, where $\kappa$ is the time step for choosing the random batch and the bound is independent of $N$. An improved $O(\kappa^{1/2})$ rate is also obtained when there is no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can potentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic Ising spin system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Flow Sampler-based Distributionally Robust Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25956v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory, we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO. While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm is based on multi-Bernoulli filtering and selects the actions that solve a non-myopic minimisation problem, where the cost function is the mean square generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) error, over a future time window. For tractability, the sensor management algorithm actually uses an upper bound of the GOSPA error and is implemented via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The sensors have the ability to jointly optimise and select their actions with the considerations of all other sensors in the surveillance area. The benefits of the proposed algorithm are analysed via simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems November 2025</p></details> |
| **[Differential privacy guarantees of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17150v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In a first part, we establish DP guarantees on samples output by MCMC algorithms as well as Monte Carlo estimators associated with these methods under assumptions on the convergence properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is released, (ii) bounds on the privacy of the entire chain trajectory. These findings provide concrete guidelines for privacy-preserving MCMC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Piecewise deterministic sampling with splitting schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02537v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms based on numerical approximations of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes obtained with the framework of splitting schemes. We present unadjusted as well as adjusted algorithms, for which the asymptotic bias due to the discretisation error is removed applying a non-reversible Metropolis-Hastings filter. In a general framework we demonstrate that the unadjusted schemes have weak error of second order in the step size, while typically maintaining a computational cost of only one gradient evaluation of the negative log-target function per iteration. Focusing then on unadjusted schemes based on the Bouncy Particle and Zig-Zag samplers, we provide conditions ensuring geometric ergodicity and consider the expansion of the invariant measure in terms of the step size. We analyse the dependence of the leading term in this expansion on the refreshment rate and on the structure of the splitting scheme, giving a guideline on which structure is best. Finally, we illustrate promising results for our samplers with numerical experiments on a Bayesian imaging inverse problem and a system of interacting particles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper to ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[HEATNETs: Explainable Random Feature Neural Networks for High-Dimensional Parabolic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00886v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We deal with the solution of the forward problem for high-dimensional parabolic PDEs with random feature (projection) neural networks (RFNNs). We first prove that there exists a single-hidden layer neural network with randomized heat-kernels arising from the fundamental solution (Green's functions) of the heat operator, that we call HEATNET, that provides an unbiased universal approximator to the solution of parabolic PDEs in arbitrary (high) dimensions, with the rate of convergence being analogous to the ${O}(N^{-1/2})$, where $N$ is the size of HEATNET. Thus, HEATNETs are explainable schemes, based on the analytical framework of parabolic PDEs, exploiting insights from physics-informed neural networks aided by numerical and functional analysis, and the structure of the corresponding solution operators. Importantly, we show how HEATNETs can be scaled up for the efficient numerical solution of arbitrary high-dimensional parabolic PDEs using suitable transformations and importance Monte Carlo sampling of the integral representation of the solution, in order to deal with the singularities of the heat kernel around the collocation points. We evaluate the performance of HEATNETs through benchmark linear parabolic problems up to 2,000 dimensions. We show that HEATNETs result in remarkable accuracy with the order of the approximation error ranging from $1.0E-05$ to $1.0E-07$ for problems up to 500 dimensions, and of the order of $1.0E-04$ to $1.0E-03$ for 1,000 to 2,000 dimensions, with a relatively low number (up to 15,000) of features.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Distributed Plug-and-Play MCMC Algorithm for High-Dimensional Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00870v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are standard approaches to solve imaging inverse problems and quantify estimation uncertainties, a key requirement in absence of ground-truth data. To improve estimation quality, Plug-and-Play MCMC algorithms, such as PnP-ULA, have been recently developed to accommodate priors encoded by a denoising neural network. Designing scalable samplers for high-dimensional imaging inverse problems remains a challenge: drawing and storing high-dimensional samples can be prohibitive, especially for high-resolution images. To address this issue, this work proposes a distributed sampler based on approximate data augmentation and PnP-ULA to solve very large problems. The proposed sampler uses lightweight denoising convolutional neural network, to efficiently exploit multiple GPUs on a Single Program Multiple Data architecture. Reconstruction performance and scalability are evaluated on several imaging problems. Communication and computation overheads due to the denoiser are carefully discussed. The proposed distributed approach noticeably combines three very precious qualities: it is scalable, enables uncertainty quantification, for a reconstruction performance comparable to other PnP methods.</p></details> |  |

We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Modularity in Multi-View Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00455v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we consider the problem of clustering multi-view data, that is, information associated to individuals that form heterogeneous data sources (the views). We adopt a Bayesian model and in the prior structure we assume that each individual belongs to a baseline cluster and conditionally allow each individual in each view to potentially belong to different clusters than the baseline. We call such a structure ''latent modularity''. Then for each cluster, in each view we have a specific statistical model with an associated prior. We derive expressions for the marginal priors on the view-specific cluster labels and the associated partitions, giving several insights into our chosen prior structure. Using simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, we consider our model in a simulation study, along with a more detailed case study that requires several modeling innovations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sherlock: Reliable and Efficient Agentic Workflow Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00330v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLM), agentic workflows, which compose multiple LLM calls with tools, retrieval, and reasoning steps, are increasingly replacing traditional applications. However, such workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct output at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages, compounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating verifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate, or LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant latency and cost overheads. In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a workflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to select the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification with minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using counterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and selectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime, Sherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead, while verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is rolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying baseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across benchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over non-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the Monte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware verification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal BESS Sizing and Placement for Mitigating EV-Induced Voltage Violations: A Scalable Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Targeting Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00297v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing demand for charging solutions are driving a surge in EV charger installations in distribution networks. However, this rising EV load strains the distribution grid, causing severe voltage drops, particularly at feeder extremities. This study proposes a proactive voltage management (PVM) framework that can integrate Monte Carlo-based simulations of varying EV charging loads to (i) identify potential voltage violations through a voltage violation analysis (VVA) model, and (ii) then mitigate those violations with optimally-invested battery energy storage systems (BESS) through an optimal expansion planning (OEP) model. A novel spatio-temporal adaptive targeting (STAT) strategy is proposed to alleviate the computational complexity of the OEP model by defining a targeted OEP (T-OEP) model, solved by applying the OEP model to (i) a reduced set of representative critical time periods and (ii) candidate BESS installation nodes. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed approach are validated on 33-bus, 69-bus, and a large-scale 240-bus system. Results demonstrate that the strategic sizing and placement of BESS not only effectively mitigate voltage violations but also yield substantial cost savings on electricity purchases under time-of-use tariffs. This research offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for integrating high penetrations of EVs, providing crucial insights for future distribution network planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural SDE Training using Wiener-Space Cubature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12395v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and diffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for neural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network) parameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on infinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods to efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with respect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the gradient expectation. In this work we introduce a novel training technique which bypasses and improves upon this Monte-Carlo simulation; we extend results in the theory of Wiener space cubature to approximate the expected objective functional value by a weighted sum of functional evaluations of deterministic ODE solutions. Our main mathematical contribution enabling this approximation is an extension of cubature bounds to the setting of Lipschitz-nonlinear functionals acting on path-space. Our resulting constructive algorithm allows for more computationally efficient training along several lines. First, it circumvents Brownian motion simulation and enables the use of efficient parallel ODE solvers, thus decreasing the complexity of path-functional evaluation. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that the number of paths required to achieve a given (expected loss functional oracle value) approximation can be reduced in this deterministic cubature regime. Specifically, we show that under reasonable regularity assumptions we can observe a O(1/n) convergence rate, where n is the number of path evaluations; in contrast with the standard O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of naive Monte-Carlo or the O(log(n)^d /n) rate of quasi-Monte-Carlo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Centered MA Dirichlet ARMA for Financial Compositions: Theory & Empirical Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18903v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation-driven Dirichlet models for compositional time series commonly use the additive log-ratio (ALR) link and include a moving-average (MA) term based on ALR residuals. In the standard Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (B-DARMA) recursion, this MA regressor has a nonzero conditional mean under the Dirichlet likelihood, which biases the mean path and complicates interpretation of the MA coefficients. We propose a minimal change: replace the raw regressor with a centered innovation equal to the ALR residual minus its conditional expectation, computable in closed form using digamma functions. Centering restores mean-zero innovations for the MA block without altering either the likelihood or the ALR link. We provide closed-form identities for the conditional mean and forecast recursion, show first-order equivalence to a digamma-link DARMA while retaining a simple inverse back to the mean composition, and supply ready-to-use code. In a weekly application to the Federal Reserve H.8 bank-asset composition, the centered specification improves log predictive scores with virtually identical point accuracy and markedly cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[pDANSE: Particle-based Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation from Nonlinear Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27503v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05655v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where multiple satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions on transmit and received signals, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in fading scenarios, considering significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, the number of UTs, the number of SAPs, the orbital altitude, and the service range affected by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results indicate that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT result in a higher coverage probability, despite the presence of multi-user interference (MUI). Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs that maximize system capacity for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, providing valuable insights for system design.</p></details> |  |

Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal; and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.</p></details> |  |

However, outside a handful of data rich cities, such data is rarely available. We introduce MOVEOD, an open-source pipeline that synthesizes public data into commuter OD flows with fine-grained spatial and temporal departure times for any county in the United States. MOVEOD combines five open data sources: American Community Survey (ACS) departure time and travel time distributions, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES) residence-to-workplace flows, county geometries, road network information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), and building footprints from OSM and Microsoft, into a single OD dataset. We use a constrained sampling and integer-programming method to reconcile the OD dataset with data from ACS and LODES. Our approach involves: (1) matching commuter totals per origin zone, (2) aligning workplace destinations with employment distributions, and (3) calibrating travel durations to ACS-reported commute times. This ensures the OD data accurately reflects commuting patterns. We demonstrate the framework on Hamilton County, Tennessee, where we generate roughly 150,000 synthetic trips in minutes, which we feed into a benchmark suite of classical and learning-based vehicle-routing algorithms. The MOVEOD pipeline is an end-to-end automated system, enabling users to easily apply it across the United States by giving only a county and a year; and it can be adapted to other countries with comparable census datasets. The source code and a lightweight browser interface are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures (including 3 validation charts and 1 map visualization).

| **[SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample-then-Filter in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Dikin-Langevin diffusion for polyhedra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04582v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interior-point geometry offers a straightforward approach to constrained sampling and optimization on polyhedra, eliminating reflections and ad hoc projections. We exploit the Dikin log-barrier to define a Dikin--Langevin diffusion whose drift and noise are modulated by the inverse barrier Hessian. In continuous time, we establish a boundary no-flux property; trajectories started in the interior remain in $U$ almost surely, so feasibility is maintained by construction. For computation, we adopt a discretize-then-correct design: an Euler--Maruyama proposal with state-dependent covariance, followed by a Metropolis--Hastings correction that targets the exact constrained law and reduces to a Dikin random walk when $f$ is constant. Numerically, the unadjusted diffusion exhibits the expected first-order step size bias, while the MH-adjusted variant delivers strong convergence diagnostics on anisotropic, box-constrained Gaussians (rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ concentrated near $1$) and higher inter-well transition counts on a bimodal target, indicating superior cross-well mobility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that coupling calibrated stochasticity with interior-point preconditioning provides a practical, reflection-free approach to sampling and optimization over polyhedral domains, offering clear advantages near faces, corners, and in nonconvex landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |

In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |
| **[ABS: Enforcing Constraint Satisfaction On Generated Sequences Via Automata-Guided Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09701v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence generation and prediction form a cornerstone of modern machine learning, with applications spanning natural language processing, program synthesis, and time-series forecasting. These tasks are typically modeled in an autoregressive fashion, where each token is generated conditional on the preceding ones, and beam search is commonly used to balance exploration and fluency during decoding. While deep learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing statistical patterns in this setting, they remain ill-equipped to guarantee compliance with formal constraints. In this paper, we introduce ABS: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with any constraint that can be compiled into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), without requiring retraining. ABS leverages the DFA to guide a constrained variant of beam search: at each decoding step, transitions leading to violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked according to both the model's probabilities and the automaton's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that ABS also improves output quality. We validate our approach on three distinct tasks: constrained image-stream classification, controlled text generation, and text infilling. In all settings, ABS achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art baselines on standard quality metrics and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of aerial vehicles is a key requirement in applications ranging from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. While most prediction methods assume deterministic target motion, real-world targets often exhibit stochastic behaviors such as evasive maneuvers or random gliding patterns. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework based on Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to model and predict such stochastic dynamics directly from trajectory data. The learned model generates probability distributions of future target positions conditioned on initial states and dynamic parameters, enabling efficient sampling and exact density evaluation. To provide deterministic surrogates compatible with existing guidance and planning algorithms, sampled trajectories are clustered using a time series k-means approach, yielding a set of representative "virtual target" trajectories. The method is target-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only trajectory data for training, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement for deterministic predictors. Simulated scenarios with maneuvering and ballistic targets demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between deterministic assumptions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI for Mobile Network RAN Management and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02532v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals, retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a universally accepted definition. This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based autonomous decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our UIST'25 paper "HAGI: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation for Mobile Eye Trackers"</p></details> |

However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

| **[Federated Quantum Kernel Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02301v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Precipitation Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for GNSS-based Precipitation Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation Nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like precipitation nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for precipitation nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focusing on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at hourly intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 140 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation protocols to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, including multi-scale prediction, multi-resolution forecasting, and extreme rainfall events, benchmarking 17 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> | 13 pages,11 figures |

Our methodology uses a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined with a wide range of neural network architectures. DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. ProbHardE2E optimizes a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general framework that connects these seemingly disparate domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The demand for algorithms that not only exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper, we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable results accessible to domain experts.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

We present DoFlow, a flow based generative model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions. Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |

The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.

The aim of this research is to further a machine's understanding of user knowledge, skill, and behavior in pursuit of implicit coordination. A task explorer pipeline was developed that uses clustering techniques, paired with factor analysis and string edit distance, to automatically identify key global and local strategies that are used to complete tasks. Global strategies identify generalized sets of actions used to complete tasks, while local strategies identify sequences that used those sets of actions in a similar composition. Additionally, meaningful subtasks of various lengths are identified within the tasks. The task explorer pipeline was able to automatically identify key strategies used to complete tasks and encode user runs with hierarchical subtask structures. In addition, a Task Explorer application was developed to easily review pipeline results. The task explorer pipeline can be easily modified to any action-based time-series data and the identified strategies and subtasks help to inform humans and machines on user knowledge, skill, and behavior.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the streamlined integration of time series with textual information.

| **[Theoretical analysis of phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01659v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is a widely used algorithm to analyze nonstationary biomedical time series. The method operates by identifying hinge points in the time series according to prescribed rules, extracting segments centered at these points (with overlap permitted), and then averaging the segments. The resulting output is intended to capture the underlying quasi-oscillatory pattern of the signal, which can subsequently serve as input for further scientific analysis. However, a theoretical analysis of PRSA is lacking. In this paper, we investigate PRSA under two settings. First, when the input consists of a superposition of two oscillatory components, $\cos(2\pi t)+A\cos(2\pi (\xi t+\phi))$, where $A>0$, $\xi\in (0,1)$ and $\phi\in [0,1)$, we show that, asymptotically when the sample size $n\to \infty$, the PRSA output takes the form $A'\sin(2\pi t)+B'\sin(2\pi \xi t)$, where $A',B'\neq 0$. Second, when the input is a stationary Gaussian random process, we establish a central limit theorem: under mild regularity conditions, the averaged vector produced by PRSA converges in distribution to a Gaussian random vector as $n\to \infty$ with mean determined by the covariance structure of the random process. These results indicate that caution is warranted when interpreting PRSA outputs for scientific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining Energy Indicators for Impact Identification on Aerospace Composites: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01592v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy estimation is critical to impact identification on aerospace composites, where low-velocity impacts can induce internal damage that is undetectable at the surface. Current methodologies for energy prediction are often constrained by data sparsity, signal noise, complex feature interdependencies, non-linear dynamics, massive design spaces, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. This study introduces a physics-informed framework that embeds domain knowledge into machine learning through a dedicated input space. The approach combines observational biases, which guide the design of physics-motivated features, with targeted feature selection to retain only the most informative indicators. Features are extracted from time, frequency, and time-frequency domains to capture complementary aspects of the structural response. A structured feature selection process integrating statistical significance, correlation filtering, dimensionality reduction, and noise robustness ensures physical relevance and interpretability. Exploratory data analysis further reveals domain-specific trends, yielding a reduced feature set that captures essential dynamic phenomena such as amplitude scaling, spectral redistribution, and transient signal behaviour. Together, these steps produce a compact set of energy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical significance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable and traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input space, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with experimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and damaged states. The resulting model demonstrates significantly improved impact energy prediction accuracy, reducing errors by a factor of three compared to conventional time-series techniques and purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods-including HIVE-COTE, Proximity Forest, and TS-CHIEF-exhibit high computational complexity, coupled with lengthy parameter tuning and training cycles. In contrast, lightweight solutions like ROCKET (Random Convolutional Kernel Transform) offer greater efficiency but leave substantial room for improvement in kernel selection and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a feature extraction approach based on Hadamard convolutional transform, utilizing column or row vectors of Hadamard matrices as convolution kernels with extended lengths of varying sizes. This enhancement maintains full compatibility with existing methods (e.g., ROCKET) while leveraging kernel orthogonality to boost computational efficiency, robustness, and adaptability. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain datasets-focusing on the UCR time series dataset-demonstrate SOTA performance: F1-score improved by at least 5% vs. ROCKET, with 50% shorter training time than miniROCKET (fastest ROCKET variant) under identical hyperparameters, enabling deployment on ultra-low-power embedded devices.

| **[NeuroClean: A Generalized Machine-Learning Approach to Neural Time-Series Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01951v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications. However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline. NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover, in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97% accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

We begin by introducing a max-$L_2$-norm based test procedure, which demonstrates strong performance under dense alternatives. We then establish the asymptotic independence between our proposed statistic and the two max-$L_\infty$-based statistics introduced by Wang and Feng (2023). Building on this result, we develop an adaptive inference approach by applying the Cauchy combination method to integrate these tests. This combined procedure exhibits robust performance across varying levels of sparsity. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis further confirm the superior effectiveness of our proposed methods in the high-dimensional setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[50 Years of Water Body Monitoring: The Case of Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24413v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation, and machine learning to estimate the reservoir's surface area and, subsequently, its volume in near real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 1-9 images are processed, where surface water is delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume derived from a reservoir bathymetric survey. The model is then able to estimate the water body's volume solely from the extracted water surface, without the need for any ground-based measurements. Water segmentation using the proposed index aligns with ground truth for over 95% of the shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR performance, with an error below 1.5% of the full reservoir capacity and coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the method's robustness and cost-effectiveness, offering a practical solution for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The proposed methodology is applicable to other water bodies and generates over five decades of time-series data, offering valuable insights into climate change and environmental dynamics, with an emphasis on capturing temporal trends rather than exact water volume measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks for Epileptic Seizure Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01275v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting epileptic seizures from multivariate EEG signals represents a critical challenge in healthcare time series prediction, requiring high sensitivity, low false alarm rates, and subject-specific adaptability. We present STAN, an Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Network that jointly models spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics through cascaded attention blocks with alternating spatial and temporal modules. Unlike existing approaches that assume fixed preictal durations or separately process spatial and temporal features, STAN captures bidirectional dependencies between spatial and temporal patterns through a unified cascaded architecture. Adversarial training with gradient penalty enables robust discrimination between interictal and preictal states learned from clearly defined 15-minute preictal windows. Continuous 90-minute pre-seizure monitoring reveals that the learned spatio-temporal attention patterns enable early detection: reliable alarms trigger at subject-specific times (typically 15-45 minutes before onset), reflecting the model's capacity to capture subtle preictal dynamics without requiring individualized training. Experiments on two benchmark EEG datasets (CHB-MIT scalp: 8 subjects, 46 events; MSSM intracranial: 4 subjects, 14 events) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: 96.6% sensitivity with 0.011 false detections per hour and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063 false detections per hour, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency (2.3M parameters, 45 ms latency, 180 MB memory) for real-time edge deployment. Beyond epilepsy, the proposed framework provides a general paradigm for spatio-temporal forecasting in healthcare and other time series domains where individual heterogeneity and interpretability are crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hi-WaveTST: A Hybrid High-Frequency Wavelet-Transformer for Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01254v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become state-of-the-art (SOTA) for time-series classification, with models like PatchTST demonstrating exceptional performance. These models rely on patching the time series and learning relationships between raw temporal data blocks. We argue that this approach is blind to critical, non-obvious high-frequency information that is complementary to the temporal dynamics. In this letter, we propose Hi-WaveTST, a novel Hybrid architecture that augments the original temporal patch with a learnable, High-Frequency wavelet feature stream. Our wavelet stream uses a deep Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) on each patch and extracts features using a learnable Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling layer. On the UCI-HAR benchmark dataset, our hybrid model achieves a mean accuracy of 93.38 percent plus-minus 0.0043, significantly outperforming the SOTA PatchTST baseline (92.59 percent plus-minus 0.0039). A comprehensive ablation study proves that every component of our design-the hybrid architecture, the deep high-frequency wavelet decomposition, and the learnable GeM pooling-is essential for this state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Understanding how key events shape SMs is key to the achievement of the SDGs. We have developed SMART (Social Media Analysis & Reasoning Tool) to track social movements related to the SDGs. SMART was designed by a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers, journalists, communications scholars and legal experts. This paper describes SMART's transformer-based multivariate time series Discourse Evolution Engine for Predictions about Social Movements (DEEP) to predict the volume of future articles/posts and the emotions expressed.

| **[TSVer: A Benchmark for Fact Verification Against Time-Series Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01101v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over temporal and numerical data, such as time series, is a crucial aspect of fact-checking. While many systems have recently been developed to handle this form of evidence, their evaluation remains limited by existing datasets, which often lack structured evidence, provide insufficient justifications for verdicts, or rely on synthetic claims. In this paper, we introduce TSVer, a new benchmark dataset for fact verification focusing on temporal and numerical reasoning with time-series evidence. TSVer contains 287 real-world claims sourced from 38 fact-checking organizations and a curated database of 400 time series covering diverse domains. Each claim is annotated with time frames across all pertinent time series, along with a verdict and justifications reflecting how the evidence is used to reach the verdict. Using an LLM-assisted multi-step annotation process, we improve the quality of our annotations and achieve an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745 on verdicts. We also develop a baseline for verifying claims against time-series evidence and show that even the state-of-the-art reasoning models like Gemini-2.5-Pro are challenged by time series, achieving a 63.37 accuracy score on verdicts and an Ev2R score of 48.63 on verdict justifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Standard Dirichlet time series models assume constant precision and therefore miss these episodes. We introduce B-DARMA-DARCH, a Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average model with a Dirichlet ARCH component, which lets the precision parameter follow an ARMA recursion. The specification preserves the Dirichlet likelihood so forecasts remain valid compositions while capturing clustered volatility. Simulations and out-of-sample tests show that B-DARMA-DARCH lowers forecast error and improves interval calibration relative to Dirichlet ARMA and log-ratio VARMA benchmarks, providing a concise framework for settings where both the level and the volatility of proportions matter.</p></details> |  |

The article presents SliceVision-F2I, a dataset of synthetic samples for studying feature visualization in network slicing for next-generation networking systems. The dataset transforms multivariate Key Performance Indicator (KPI) vectors into visual representations through four distinct encoding methods: physically inspired mappings, Perlin noise, neural wallpapering, and fractal branching. For each encoding method, 30,000 samples are generated, each comprising a raw KPI vector and a corresponding RGB image at low-resolution pixels. The dataset simulates realistic and noisy network conditions to reflect operational uncertainties and measurement imperfections. SliceVision-F2I is suitable for tasks involving visual learning, network state classification, anomaly detection, and benchmarking of image-based machine learning techniques applied to network data. The dataset is publicly available and can be reused in various research contexts, including multivariate time series analysis, synthetic data generation, and feature-to-image transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23719v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hydra: Dual Exponentiated Memory for Multivariate Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00989v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, effectively modeling multivariate time series has gained significant popularity, mainly due to its wide range of applications, ranging from healthcare to financial markets and energy management. Transformers, MLPs, and linear models as the de facto backbones of modern time series models have shown promising results in single-variant and/or short-term forecasting. These models, however: (1) are permutation equivariant and so lack temporal inductive bias, being less expressive to capture the temporal dynamics; (2) are naturally designed for univariate setup, missing the inter-dependencies of temporal and variate dimensions; and/or (3) are inefficient for Long-term time series modeling. To overcome training and inference efficiency as well as the lack of temporal inductive bias, recently, linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have gained attention as an alternative to Transformer-based models. These models, however, are inherently limited to a single sequence, missing inter-variate dependencies, and can propagate errors due to their additive nature. In this paper, we present Hydra, a by-design two-headed meta in-context memory module that learns how to memorize patterns at test time by prioritizing time series patterns that are more informative about the data. Hydra uses a 2-dimensional recurrence across both time and variate at each step, which is more powerful than mixing methods. Although the 2-dimensional nature of the model makes its training recurrent and non-parallelizable, we present a new 2D-chunk-wise training algorithm that approximates the actual recurrence with $\times 10$ efficiency improvement, while maintaining the effectiveness. Our experimental results on a diverse set of tasks and datasets, including time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection show the superior performance of Hydra compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We present an interactive application that enables end-to-end data-driven slug detection through a compact and user-friendly interface. The system integrates data exploration and labeling, configurable model training and evaluation with multiple classifiers, visualization of classification results with time-series overlays, and a real-time inference module that generates persistence-based alerts when slug events are detected. The demo supports seamless workflows from labeled CSV uploads to live inference on unseen datasets, making it lightweight, portable, and easily deployable. By combining domain-relevant analytics with novel UI/UX features such as snapshot persistence, visual labeling, and real-time alerting, our tool adds significant dissemination value as both a research prototype and a practical industrial application.

| **[Enhancing Sequential Model Performance with Squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) Activation Under Data Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09034v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation functions enable neural networks to learn complex representations by introducing non-linearities. While feedforward models commonly use rectified linear units, sequential models like recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) still rely on Sigmoid and TanH activation functions. However, these classical activation functions often struggle to model sparse patterns when trained on small sequential datasets to effectively capture temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) activation specifically tailored to enhance the learning capability of sequential models under data constraints. SST applies mathematical squaring to amplify differences between strong and weak activations as signals propagate over time, facilitating improved gradient flow and information filtering. We evaluate SST-powered LSTMs and GRUs for diverse applications, such as sign language recognition, regression, and time-series classification tasks, where the dataset is limited. Our experiments demonstrate that SST models consistently outperform RNN-based models with baseline activations, exhibiting improved test accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |
| **[SST: Multi-Scale Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Experts for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14757v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has made significant advances, including with Transformer-based models. The attention mechanism in Transformer effectively captures temporal dependencies by attending to all past inputs simultaneously. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length limits the scalability for long-range modeling. Recent state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative by achieving linear complexity without attention. Yet, Mamba compresses historical information into a fixed-size latent state, potentially causing information loss and limiting representational effectiveness. This raises a key research question: Can we design a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture that is both effective and efficient for time series forecasting? To address it, we adapt a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture Mambaformer, originally proposed for language modeling, to the time series domain. Preliminary experiments reveal that naively stacking Mamba and Transformer layers in Mambaformer is suboptimal for time series forecasting, due to an information interference problem. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new time series decomposition strategy that separates time series into long-range patterns and short-range variations. Then we show that Mamba excels at capturing long-term structures, while Transformer is more effective at modeling short-term dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose State Space Transformer (SST), a multi-scale hybrid model with expert modules: a Mamba expert for long-range patterns and a Transformer expert for short-term variations. SST also employs a multi-scale patching mechanism to adaptively adjust time series resolution: low resolution for long-term patterns and high resolution for short-term variations. Experiments show that SST obtains SOTA performance with linear scalability. The code is at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/SST.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |
| **[Effective Series Decomposition and Components Learning for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00747v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation focuses on modeling the underlying data distribution and resampling to produce authentic time series data. Key components, such as trend and seasonality, drive temporal fluctuations, yet many existing approaches fail to employ interpretative decomposition methods, limiting their ability to synthesize meaningful trend and seasonal patterns. To address this gap, we introduce Seasonal-Trend Diffusion (STDiffusion), a novel framework for multivariate time series generation that integrates diffusion probabilistic models with advanced learnable series decomposition techniques, enhancing the interpretability of the generation process. Our approach separates the trend and seasonal learning into distinct blocks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) structure captures the trend, while adaptive wavelet distillation facilitates effective multi-resolution learning of seasonal components. This decomposition improves the interpretability of the model on multiple scales. In addition, we designed a comprehensive correction mechanism aimed at ensuring that the generated components exhibit a high degree of internal consistency and preserve meaningful interrelationships with one another. Our empirical studies on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series generation tasks. Furthermore, we extend the model's application to multi-window long-sequence time series generation, which delivered reliable results and highlighted its robustness and versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025).

Privacy-aware synthetic time series generation addresses this challenge by enforcing noise during training, inherently introducing a trade-off between privacy and utility. In many cases, sensitive sequences is correlated with publicly available, non-sensitive contextual metadata (e.g., household electricity consumption may be influenced by weather conditions and electricity prices). However, existing privacy-aware data generation methods often overlook this opportunity, resulting in suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs. In this paper, we present Pub2Priv, a novel framework for generating private time series data by leveraging heterogeneous public knowledge. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism to encode public data into temporal and feature embeddings, which serve as conditional inputs for a diffusion model to generate synthetic private sequences. Additionally, we introduce a practical metric to assess privacy by evaluating the identifiability of the synthetic data. Experimental results show that Pub2Priv consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in improving the privacy-utility trade-off across finance, energy, and commodity trading domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

| **[Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Interpretable Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14904v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a relevant step supporting decision-making processes in various domains, and deep neural models have shown promising performance in this respect. Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to deep learning. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time series classification utilising 117 datasets from UCR benchmark archive, from multiple different domains. More specifically, we investigate a) the transferability of reference architectures designed for regression to classification tasks, b) identifying the hyperparameter and implementation configurations for an architecture that best generalizes across 117 datasets, c) the associated complexity trade-offs and d) evaluate KANs interpretability. Our results demonstrate that (1) the Efficient KAN outperforms MLPs in both performance and training times, showcasing its suitability for classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN exhibits greater stability than the original KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, especially when lower learning rates are employed. (3) KAN achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as HIVE-COTE2 and InceptionTime, while maintaining smaller architectures and faster training times, highlighting its favorable balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model, as confirmed by SHAP analysis, reinforces its capacity for transparent decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional lead-lag detection methods are limited by their reliance on statistical analysis methods and by the assumption of persistent lead-lag patterns, which are often invalid in dynamic market conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{DeltaLag}, the first end-to-end deep learning method that discovers and exploits dynamic lead-lag structures with pair-specific lag values in financial markets for portfolio construction. Specifically, DeltaLag employs a sparsified cross-attention mechanism to identify relevant lead-lag pairs. These lead-lag signals are then leveraged to extract lag-aligned raw features from the leading stocks for predicting the lagger stock's future return. Empirical evaluations show that DeltaLag substantially outperforms both fixed-lag and self-lead-lag baselines. In addition, its adaptive mechanism for identifying lead-lag relationships consistently surpasses precomputed lead-lag graphs based on statistical methods. Furthermore, DeltaLag outperforms a wide range of temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning models designed for stock prediction or time series forecasting, offering both better trading performance and enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A systematic evaluation of uncertainty quantification techniques in deep learning: a case study in photoplethysmography signal analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00301v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In principle, deep learning models trained on medical time-series, including wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor data, can provide a means to continuously monitor physiological parameters outside of clinical settings. However, there is considerable risk of poor performance when deployed in practical measurement scenarios leading to negative patient outcomes. Reliable uncertainties accompanying predictions can provide guidance to clinicians in their interpretation of the trustworthiness of model outputs. It is therefore of interest to compare the effectiveness of different approaches. Here we implement an unprecedented set of eight uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to models trained on two clinically relevant prediction tasks: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection (classification), and two variants of blood pressure regression. We formulate a comprehensive evaluation procedure to enable a rigorous comparison of these approaches. We observe a complex picture of uncertainty reliability across the different techniques, where the most optimal for a given task depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessed. We find that assessing local calibration and adaptivity provides practically relevant insights about model behaviour that otherwise cannot be acquired using more commonly implemented global reliability metrics. We emphasise that criteria for evaluating UQ techniques should cater to the model's practical use case, where the use of a small number of measurements per patient places a premium on achieving small-scale reliability for the chosen expression of uncertainty, while preserving as much predictive performance as possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-TRACK: Physics-Aware xLSTM for Realistic Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00266v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, particularly the Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM), have addressed the limitations of traditional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks by introducing exponential gating and enhanced memory structures. These improvements make xLSTM suitable for time-series prediction tasks as they exhibit the ability to model long-term temporal dependencies better than LSTMs. Despite their potential, these xLSTM-based models remain largely unexplored in the context of vehicle trajectory prediction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel xLSTM-based vehicle trajectory prediction framework, X-TRAJ, and its physics-aware variant, X-TRACK (eXtended LSTM for TRAjectory prediction Constraint by Kinematics), which explicitly integrates vehicle motion kinematics into the model learning process. By introducing physical constraints, the proposed model generates realistic and feasible trajectories. A comprehensive evaluation on the highD and NGSIM datasets demonstrates that X-TRACK outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.

| **[Evaluating Simplification Algorithms for Interpretability of Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08846v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time series in the context of interpretability of a TSC -- a Time Series Classifier. Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to text and image data, are not intuitively under- standable to humans. These metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications -- how many segments they contain -- and to their loyalty -- how likely they are to maintain the classification of the original time series. We focus on simplifications that select a subset of the original data points, and show that these typically have high Shapley value, thereby aiding interpretability. We employ these metrics to experimentally evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long. We subsequently perform a human-grounded evaluation with forward simulation, that confirms also the practical utility of the introduced metrics to evaluate the use of simplifications in the context of interpretability of TSC. Our findings are summarized in a framework for deciding, for a given TSC, if the various simplifications are likely to aid in its interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Robotic Upper-Limb Assessment Time While Maintaining Precision: A Time Series Foundation Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00193v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Visually Guided Reaching (VGR) on the Kinarm robot yields sensitive kinematic biomarkers but requires 40-64 reaches, imposing time and fatigue burdens. We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace unrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the reliability of standard Kinarm parameters. Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control participants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the first 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models, fine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We recomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time, posture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and compared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1). Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only 8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded reaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA improvements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials replaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability. Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR assessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5 minutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This forecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for assessing motor impairments following stroke.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Centered MA Dirichlet ARMA for Financial Compositions: Theory & Empirical Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18903v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation-driven Dirichlet models for compositional time series commonly use the additive log-ratio (ALR) link and include a moving-average (MA) term based on ALR residuals. In the standard Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (B-DARMA) recursion, this MA regressor has a nonzero conditional mean under the Dirichlet likelihood, which biases the mean path and complicates interpretation of the MA coefficients. We propose a minimal change: replace the raw regressor with a centered innovation equal to the ALR residual minus its conditional expectation, computable in closed form using digamma functions. Centering restores mean-zero innovations for the MA block without altering either the likelihood or the ALR link. We provide closed-form identities for the conditional mean and forecast recursion, show first-order equivalence to a digamma-link DARMA while retaining a simple inverse back to the mean composition, and supply ready-to-use code. In a weekly application to the Federal Reserve H.8 bank-asset composition, the centered specification improves log predictive scores with virtually identical point accuracy and markedly cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MapSAM2: Adapting SAM2 for Automatic Segmentation of Historical Map Images and Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27547v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video, enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations. Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code to support future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Generic Time Series Foundation Models for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27522v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance, consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the broader time series literature.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a robust fuzzy clustering framework in the spectral domain that leverages Kendall's tau-based canonical coherence to extract frequency-specific monotonic relationships across variables. Our method takes advantage of dominant frequency-based cross-regional connectivity patterns to improve clustering accuracy while remaining resilient to outliers, making the approach broadly applicable to noisy, high-dimensional MTS. Each series is projected onto vectors generated from a spectral matrix specifically tailored to capture the underlying fuzzy partitions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods. As a flagship application, we analyze electroencephalogram recordings, where our approach uncovers frequency- and connectivity-specific markers of latent cognitive states such as alertness and drowsiness, revealing discriminative patterns and ambiguous transitions.</p></details> |  |

We propose MedM2T, a time-aware multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction; an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising tool in clinical prediction.

| **[Modeling US Climate Policy Uncertainty: From Causal Identification to Probabilistic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12276v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is critical for designing effective climate strategies that balance economic growth with environmental objectives. Elevated CPU levels deter investment in green technologies, delay regulatory implementation, and amplify public resistance to policy reforms, particularly during economic stress. Despite the growing literature highlighting the economic relevance of CPU, the mechanisms through which macroeconomic and financial conditions influence its fluctuations remain insufficiently explored. This study addresses this gap by integrating four complementary causal inference techniques to identify statistically and economically significant determinants of the United States (US) CPU index. Impulse response analysis confirms their dynamic effects on CPU, highlighting the role of housing market activity, credit conditions, and financial market sentiment in shaping CPU fluctuations. The identified predictors, along with sentiment based Google Trends indicators, are incorporated into a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) framework for probabilistic forecasting. The inclusion of Google Trends data captures behavioral and attention based dynamics, leading to notable improvements in forecast accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of BSTS over state of the art classical and modern architectures for medium and long term forecasts, which are most relevant for climate policy implementation. The feature importance plot provides evidence that the spike-and-slab prior mechanism provides interpretable variable selection. The credible intervals quantify forecast uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's transparency and policy relevance by enabling strategic decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Invariant Feature Decoupling in Source-free Time Series Forecasting with Proxy Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05589v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.</p></details> |  |

The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IAU Symposium 397: Exploring the Universe with Artificial Intelligence (UniversAI 2025), Cambridge University Press.

| **[SVTime: Small Time Series Forecasting Models Informed by "Physics" of Large Vision Model Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09780v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF -- and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets, SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training and inference in low-resource settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal View Enhanced Large Vision Models for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24003v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LVM-based forecaster poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast-residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 SOTA models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.

| **[Robust fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional multivariate time series with outlier detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26982v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzy clustering provides a natural framework for modeling partial memberships, particularly important in multivariate time series (MTS) where state boundaries are often ambiguous. For example, in EEG monitoring of driver alertness, neural activity evolves along a continuum (from unconscious to fully alert, with many intermediate levels of drowsiness) so crisp labels are unrealistic and partial memberships are essential. However, most existing algorithms are developed for static, low-dimensional data and struggle with temporal dependence, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and contamination by noise or artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce RFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method explicitly tailored to MTS that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to simultaneously: (i) learn membership-informed subspaces, (ii) accommodate unequal lengths and moderately high dimensions, (iii) achieve robustness through trimming, exponential reweighting, and a dedicated noise cluster, and (iv) automatically select all required hyperparameters. These components enable RFCPCA to capture latent temporal structure, provide calibrated membership uncertainty, and flag series-level outliers while remaining stable under contamination. On driver drowsiness EEG, RFCPCA improves clustering accuracy over related methods and yields a more reliable characterization of uncertainty and outlier structure in MTS.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

With sensors and devices capturing every operational detail, the volume of time-series data has become a critical challenge for storage and processing systems. Efficient data management is essential to ensure scalability, cost-effectiveness, and timely analytics. To minimize storage expenses and optimize performance, data compression algorithms are frequently utilized in data historians and acquisition systems. However, compression comes with trade-offs that may compromise the accuracy and reliability of engineering analytics that depend on this compressed data. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for developing data strategies that support both operational efficiency and accurate, reliable analytics. This paper assesses the relation of common compression mechanisms used in real-time and historical data systems and the accuracy of analytical solutions, including statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning models. Through theoretical analysis, simulated signal compression, and empirical assessment, we illustrate that excessive compression can lose critical patterns, skew statistical measures, and diminish predictive accuracy. The study suggests optimum methods and best practices for striking a compromise between analytical integrity and compression efficiency.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSAD: A Deep Dive into Model Selection for Time series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26643v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

Recent quantum machine learning approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits, have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models. Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware, where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Causal Relationships Between Time Series With Spatial Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26485v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is the subfield of causal inference concerned with estimating the structure of cause-and-effect relationships in a system of interrelated variables, as opposed to quantifying the strength of causal effects. As interest in causal discovery builds in fields such as ecology, public health, and environmental sciences where data is regularly collected with spatial and temporal structures, approaches must evolve to manage autocorrelation and complex confounding. As it stands, the few proposed causal discovery algorithms for spatiotemporal data require summarizing across locations, ignore spatial autocorrelation, and/or scale poorly to high dimensions. Here, we introduce our developing framework that extends time-series causal discovery to systems with spatial structure, building upon work on causal discovery across contexts and methods for handling spatial confounding in causal effect estimation. We close by outlining remaining gaps in the literature and directions for future research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

In the classical univariate case, the latter is based on fitting an extreme-value distribution to the sample of (annual) block maxima. Mathematically, the target parameters of the extreme-value distribution also show up in limit results for other high order statistics, which suggests estimation based on blockwise large order statistics. It is shown that a naive approach based on maximizing an independence log-likelihood yields an estimator that is inconsistent in general. A consistent, bias-corrected estimator is proposed, and is analyzed theoretically and in finite-sample simulation studies. The new estimator is shown to be more efficient than traditional counterparts, for instance for estimating large return levels or return periods.</p></details> | 92 pages |

However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents AIMeter, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, AIMeter offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By addressing critical limitations in existing tools, AIMeter encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI" practices.

We evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features, clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for presentation at the IEEE SAMI 2026 Conference</p></details> |

By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72 studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation. We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data solutions for the financial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 5 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (e.g., weather and location). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata. Additionally, the heterogeneity in metadata poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce TIME WEAVER, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that TIME WEAVER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 30% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\sim100$) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 70\% and 22\%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator, and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures with Tikhonov regularization. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance, and study some of its finite-sample concentration properties. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for arbitrary time-point sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

We present RailEstate, a novel web based system that integrates spatial analytics, natural language interfaces, and interactive forecasting to analyze how proximity to metro stations influences residential property prices in the Washington metropolitan area. Unlike static mapping tools or generic listing platforms, RailEstate combines 25 years of historical housing data with transit infrastructure to support low latency geospatial queries, time series visualizations, and predictive modeling. Users can interactively explore ZIP code level price patterns, investigate long term trends, and forecast future housing values around any metro station. A key innovation is our natural language chatbot, which translates plain-English questions e.g., What is the highest price in Falls Church in the year 2000? into executable SQL over a spatial database. This unified and interactive platform empowers urban planners, investors, and residents to derive actionable insights from metro linked housing data without requiring technical expertise.</p></details> |  |

To allay stress, expecting parents seek advice and share experiences in a variety of venues, from in-person birth education classes and parenting groups to virtual communities, for example, BabyCenter, a moderated online forum community with over 4 million members in the United States alone. In this study, we aim to understand how parents talk about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by analyzing 5.43M posts and comments from the April 2017--January 2024 cohort of 331,843 BabyCenter "birth club" users (that is, users who participate in due date forums or "birth clubs" based on their babies' due dates). Using BERTopic to locate breastfeeding threads and LDA to summarize themes, we compare documents in breastfeeding threads to all other birth-club content. Analyzing time series of word rank, we find that posts and comments containing anxiety-related terms increased steadily from April 2017 to January 2024. We used an ensemble of topic models to identify dominant breastfeeding topics within birth clubs, and then explored trends among all user content versus those who posted in threads related to breastfeeding topics. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify the most common topics in the full population, as well as within the subset breastfeeding population. We find that the topic of sleep dominates in content generated by the breastfeeding population, as well anxiety-related and work/daycare topics that are not predominant in the full BabyCenter birth club dataset.</p></details> |  |

Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU.

Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50% in R^2 and 12% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods primarily focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Access.

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation.

| **[Personalized Decision Modeling: Utility Optimization or Textualized-Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02194v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process, shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences (e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration. ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices. Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling human-centric decisions.

| **[Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures from Histogram Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01838v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs) are a family of information representation techniques which enable composition, i.e., creating complex information structures from atomic vectors via binding and superposition, and have recently found wide ranging applications in various neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Recently, Raviv proposed the use of random linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables efficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary for neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under noise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery, i.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy compositional representation. In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First, we argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable for VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a folklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional representations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In histogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given as input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length $N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms. We present an optimal solution to the histogram recovery problem by using algorithms related to list-decoding, and analyze the resulting noise resilience. Our results give rise to a noise-resilient VSA with formal guarantees regarding efficient encoding, quasi-orthogonality, and recovery, without relying on any heuristics or training, and while operating at improved parameters relative to similar solutions such as the Hadamard code.</p></details> |  |

While current benchmarks assess language understanding, factual recall, mathematics or code generation, none capture the integrative reasoning central to engineering where scientific principles, quantitative modeling and practical constraints must converge. To address this gap, we introduce EngChain, a benchmark for verifiable multi-step engineering problem-solving. EngChain contains 90 problems spanning three engineering branches, organized into 9 domains and 20 distinct areas. The problems are generated from symbolic templates with a high degree of randomization to ensure diversity and eliminate the risk of contamination. With this benchmark, we move beyond final answer accuracy with a two-stage evaluation: we first quantitatively verify the numerical and semantic validity of each reasoning step and then introduce LLM-As-A-Judge, an automated system to qualitatively categorize the identified reasoning errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, includes figures and tables; introduces the EngChain benchmark</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21406v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Equality Graph Assisted Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01009v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Symbolic Regression (SR), Genetic Programming (GP) is a popular search algorithm that delivers state-of-the-art results in term of accuracy. Its success relies on the concept of neutrality, which induces large plateaus that the search can safely navigate to more promising regions. Navigating these plateaus, while necessary, requires the computation of redundant expressions, up to 60% of the total number of evaluation, as noted in a recent study. The equality graph (e-graph) structure can compactly store and group equivalent expressions enabling us to verify if a given expression and their variations were already visited by the search, thus enabling us to avoid unnecessary computation. We propose a new search algorithm for symbolic regression called SymRegg that revolves around the e-graph structure following simple steps: perturb solutions sampled from a selection of expressions stored in the e-graph, if it generates an unvisited expression, insert it into the e-graph and generates its equivalent forms. We show that SymRegg is capable of improving the efficiency of the search, maintaining consistently accurate results across different datasets while requiring a choice of a minimalist set of hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbol Detection in a MIMO Wireless Communication System Using a FeFET-coupled CMOS Ring Oscillator Array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00479v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbol decoding in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems requires the deployment of fast, energy-efficient computing hardware deployable at the edge. The brute-force, exact maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, solved on conventional classical digital hardware, has exponential time complexity. Approximate classical solvers implemented on the same hardware have polynomial time complexity at the best. In this article, we design an alternative ring-oscillator-based coupled oscillator array to act as an oscillator Ising machine (OIM) and heuristically solve the ML-based MIMO detection problem. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is used to design the ring oscillators, and ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) technology is chosen as the coupling element (X) between the oscillators in this CMOS + X OIM design. For this purpose, we experimentally report high linear range of conductance variation (1 micro-S to 60 micro-S) in a FeFET device fabricated at 28 nm high-K/ metal gate (HKMG) CMOS technology node. We incorporate the conductance modulation characteristic in SPICE simulation of the ring oscillators connected in an all-to-all fashion through a crossbar array of these FeFET devices. We show that the above range of conductance variation of the FeFET device is suitable to obtain optimum OIM performance with no significant performance drop up to a MIMO size of 100 transmitting and 100 receiving antennas, thereby making FeFET a suitable device for this application. Our simulations and associated analysis using the Kuramoto model of oscillators also predict that this designed classical analog OIM, if implemented experimentally, will offer logarithmic scaling of computation time with MIMO size, thereby offering a huge improvement (in terms of computation speed) over aforementioned MIMO decoders run on conventional digital hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages including supplementary information, 5 main figures, 4 main tables, 2 supplementary figures, 2 supplementary tables</p></details> |

Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</p></details> |  |

The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges for internally decomposed polyhedra with the minimal number of added internal edges. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26340v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection, while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5 degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed. SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA estimation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Towards Scaling Laws for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26064v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of $\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of SR models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Math-AI Workshop</p></details> |

We introduce a symbolic scaffolding method paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which prompt-level cognitive scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Yet it remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience. We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern: scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC) gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Translate Human Instructions into a Reinforcement Learning Agent's Internal Emergent Symbolic Representation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24259v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further research on robust alignment between language and internal agent representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymMaP: Improving Computational Efficiency in Linear Solvers through Symbolic Preconditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24170v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of linear systems, where performance heavily depends on the selection of preconditioning parameters. Traditional parameter selection approaches often define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML) approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning (SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making it simple and reliable for deployment. Experimental results show that SymMaP consistently outperforms traditional strategies across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Without architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness: identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and +10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+ formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios. These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments.

| **[Symbolic Neural Generation with Applications to Lead Discovery in Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23379v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and \textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures; partial overlap of experimental results with https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.14.634875</p></details> |

| **[ENTP: Enhancing Low-Quality SFT Data via Neural-Symbolic Text Purge-Mix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23160v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP (Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction alignment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at the 10th International Workshop on Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Perception and Reasoning: Dual-Pipeline Neuro-Symbolic Landing for UAVs in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22204v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor) environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline, where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations (adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps, and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.</p></details> |  |

Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems. Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy. Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.</p></details> |  |

However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources, and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation. However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR. These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data. Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data. As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods. We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in GECCO '24</p></details> |

For research and assessment purposes, so-called embedding models are typically employed to generate numeric representations of text that capture its semantic content for use in subsequent quantitative analyses. Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing research studies and practical applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased research findings and diminished performance of practical applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: 1) similarity-based analyses and 2) integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Overall, this study underscores the importance for educational data mining researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions.

In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data, supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks. SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets. Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in SheetBench.

Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures.

While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> | version2 |
| **[A Unified Formal Theory on the Logical Limits of Symbol Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Hardness of Learning Regular Languages in the Next Symbol Prediction Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18634v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP) setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Apple's Find My is perhaps the most ubiquitous such system which can even locate devices which do not possess any cellular support or GPS, running on millions of devices worldwide. Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks. In this paper, we present a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties, and provide automated, machine-checkable proofs of these properties in the Tamarin prover.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Series-Symbol Data Generation for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08445v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.

| **[From Equations to Insights: Unraveling Symbolic Structures in PDEs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09986v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse fields, the application of AI to solve scientific problems, often formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs), has garnered increasing attention. While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of symbolic machine learning for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hey Pentti, We Did It Again!: Differentiable vector-symbolic types that prove polynomial termination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16533v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card, 1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000), exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020; Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hey Pentti, We Did It!: A Fully Vector-Symbolic Lisp](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17889v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kanerva (2014) suggested that it would be possible to construct a complete Lisp out of a vector-symbolic architecture. We present the general form of a vector-symbolic representation of the five Lisp elementary functions, lambda expressions, and other auxiliary functions, found in the Lisp 1.5 specification McCarthy (1960), which is near minimal and sufficient for Turing-completeness. Our specific implementation uses holographic reduced representations Plate (1995), with a lookup table cleanup memory. Lisp, as all Turing-complete languages, is a Cartesian closed category, unusual in its proximity to the mathematical abstraction. We discuss the mathematics, the purpose, and the significance of demonstrating vector-symbolic architectures' Cartesian-closure, as well as the importance of explicitly including cleanup memories in the specification of the architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATA: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Implement Autonomous and Trustworthy Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16381v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuseTok: Symbolic Music Tokenization for Generation and Semantic Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16273v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete representation learning has shown promising results across various domains, including generation and understanding in image, speech and language. Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, includes figures and tables; introduces the FinChain benchmark and ChainEval metric</p></details> |
| **[Point or Line? Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23395v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13796v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the generation of realistic, handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic score generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at ICDAR workshop GREC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbol Grounding in Neuro-Symbolic AI: A Gentle Introduction to Reasoning Shortcuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14538v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.</p></details> |  |

Existing DJSCC approaches focus primarily on point-to-point wireless communication scenarios, while neglecting end-to-end communication efficiency in hybrid wireless-wired networks such as 5G and 6G communication systems. Considerable redundancy in DJSCC symbols against wireless channels becomes inefficient for long-distance wired transmission. Furthermore, DJSCC symbols must adapt to the varying transmission rate of the wired network to avoid congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed for efficient wired transmission of DJSCC symbols within hybrid wireless-wired networks, namely Rate-Controllable Wired Adaptor (RCWA). RCWA achieves redundancy-aware coding for DJSCC symbols to improve transmission efficiency, which removes considerable redundancy present in DJSCC symbols for wireless channels and encodes only source-relevant information into bits. Moreover, we leverage the Lagrangian multiplier method to achieve controllable and continuous variable-rate coding, which can encode given features into expected rates, thereby minimizing end-to-end distortion while satisfying given constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior RD performance and robustness of RCWA compared to existing baselines, validating its potential for wired resource utilization in hybrid transmission scenarios. Specifically, our method can obtain peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of up to 0.7dB and 4dB compared to neural network-based methods and digital baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn after identifying that results in Section 5 require additional re-analysis before public dissemination</p></details> |

Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://onelife-worldmodel.github.io/; 39 pages</p></details> |

This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3figures.

| **[Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.</p></details> |  |

We propose logistic-gated operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness -- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, individuals with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the "digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models (LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts. Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200 semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves underprivileged populations with limited formal education.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |

The proposed approach learns simultaneously the partition of the input domain (splitting logic) as well as local nonlinear expressions for predicting the control action leading to interpretable piecewise nonlinear control laws. The local nonlinear expressions are determined by the learning problem and are modeled using a set of basis functions. The learning task is posed as a mixed integer optimization, which is solved to global optimality with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers. We apply the proposed approach to a case study regarding the control of an isothermal reactor. The results show that the proposed approach can learn the control law accurately, leading to closed-loop performance comparable to that of a standard model predictive controller. Finally, comparison with existing interpretable models shows that the symbolic trees achieve both lower prediction error and superior closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proof Strategy Extraction from LLMs for Enhancing Symbolic Provers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10131v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One important approach to software verification is interactive theorem proving. However, writing formal proofs often requires substantial human effort, making proof automation highly important. Traditionally, proof automation has relied on symbolic provers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in theorem proving, complementing symbolic provers. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs can be expensive and may pose security risks for confidential codebases. As a result, purely symbolic approaches remain important even in the LLM era, as they are cost-effective, secure, and complement the strengths of LLMs. Motivated by these considerations, we ask a new research question: can we extract the internal strategies of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of symbolic provers? As an initial attempt to answer this question, we propose Strat2Rocq, which extracts proof strategies from LLMs and formalizes them as lemmas in Rocq. These lemmas are accessible to symbolic provers such as CoqHammer. With the addition of these LLM-extracted lemmas, CoqHammer is able to prove more theorems. The knowledge extraction process involves analyzing the proof trajectories of LLMs on a training set of proved theorems. For each theorem, we prompt the LLM to generate a natural language proof, then ask it to summarize this proof into formalized lemmas with proofs. We also employ a standard agentic approach to mitigate errors during formalization. Our evaluation demonstrates that, on open-source Rocq projects for software verification, Strat2Rocq enhances the success rate of CoqHammer by 13.41%.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[NL2GenSym: Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules for SOAR Cognitive Architecture via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09355v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning LLM+PDDL Symbolic Plans with Human Objective Specifications through Evolutionary Algorithm Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00300v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated planning using a symbolic planning language, such as PDDL, is a general approach to producing optimal plans to achieve a stated goal. However, creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored utilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to generate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human (LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to a set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. We account for this using an evolutionary approach to generate a population of symbolic goal specifications with slight differences from the initial translation, and utilize a trained LSTM-based validation model to assess whether each induced plan in the population adheres to the natural language specifications. We evaluate our approach on a collection of prototypical specifications in a notional naval disaster recovery task, and demonstrate that our evolutionary approach improve adherence of generated plans to natural language specifications when compared to plans generated using only LLM translations. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/owenonline/PlanCritic.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Iterated Agent for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08317v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing, RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both the C and Rust functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages to appear in Proceedings of ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic-Diffusion: Deep Learning Based Symbolic Regression with D3PM Discrete Token Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07570v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently, neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures. We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based symbolic regression.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 3 Figurees |
| **[Tempo: Compiled Dynamic Deep Learning with Symbolic Dependence Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05408v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of temporal relationships: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such dynamic dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while eager DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; graph-based systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs. We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with recurrent tensors, which include explicit temporal dimensions. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using symbolic expressions to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a symbolic dependence graph, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 24 figures, 3 bibliography pages</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06774v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive, multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods, yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement. Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06635v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws. However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN. Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[BACHI: Boundary-Aware Symbolic Chord Recognition Through Masked Iterative Decoding on Pop and Classical Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06528v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module.</p></details> | Under review |

To address this, we introduce AGENT+P, a novel framework that leverages symbolic planning to guide LLM-based UI agents. Specifically, we model an app's UI transition structure as a UI Transition Graph (UTG), which allows us to reformulate the UI automation task as a pathfinding problem on the UTG. This further enables an off-the-shelf symbolic planner to generate a provably correct and optimal high-level plan, preventing the agent from redundant exploration and guiding the agent to achieve the automation goals. AGENT+P is designed as a plug-and-play framework to enhance existing UI agents. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark demonstrates that AGENT+P improves the success rates of state-of-the-art UI agents by up to 14% and reduces the action steps by 37.7%.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages double column; two figures</p></details> |

We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.</p></details> |  |

Exploring How Humans and AI Interact with Symbols and Meanings in Their Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05378v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction, AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation. Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols, suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.</p></details> | CHI 2026 Papers |

Investigating Memorization, Emergence, and Symbolic Processing in In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11004v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more informed guidelines.</p></details> | TMLR |

We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LLMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. Conceptually, SymPlanner operationalizes two cognitive faculties: (i) error monitoring and repair via externalized feedback (IC) and (ii) preference formation among alternatives via pairwise comparison (CR), advancing cognitively plausible, symbol-grounded planning aligned with the rich structure in intelligent systems. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Twelfth Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems</p></details> |

The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-interactive reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, Symbolic-Aided CoT preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning tasks and scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 39th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 39)</p></details> |

To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |

Identifying vulnerable functions in target binaries alone is insufficient; it is also crucial to determine whether these functions have been patched. Existing methods, however, suffer from limited usability and accuracy. They often depend on the compilation process to extract features, requiring substantial manual effort and failing for certain software. Moreover, they cannot reliably differentiate between code changes caused by patches or compilation variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lares, a scalable and accurate method for patch presence testing. Lares introduces Code Slice Semantic Search, which directly extracts features from the patch source code and identifies semantically equivalent code slices in the pseudocode of the target binary. By eliminating the need for the compilation process, Lares improves usability, while leveraging large language models (LLMs) for code analysis and SMT solvers for logical reasoning to enhance accuracy. Experimental results show that Lares achieves superior precision, recall, and usability. Furthermore, it is the first work to evaluate patch presence testing across optimization levels, architectures, and compilers. The datasets and source code used in this article are available at https://github.com/Siyuan-Li201/Lares.</p></details> |  |

We propose MiRAGE - Misconception Detection with Retrieval-Guided Multi-Stage Reasoning and Ensemble Fusion, a novel framework for automated misconception detection in mathematics. MiRAGE operates in three stages: (1) a Retrieval module narrows a large candidate pool to a semantically relevant subset; (2) a Reasoning module employs chain-of-thought generation to expose logical inconsistencies in student solutions; and (3) a Reranking module refines predictions by aligning them with the reasoning. These components are unified through an ensemble-fusion strategy that enhances robustness and interpretability. On mathematics datasets, MiRAGE achieves Mean Average Precision scores of 0.82/0.92/0.93 at levels 1/3/5, consistently outperforming individual modules. By coupling retrieval guidance with multi-stage reasoning, MiRAGE reduces dependence on large-scale language models while delivering a scalable and effective solution for educational assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically constrained to reason in the language space, where they express the reasoning process through a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve complex problems. However, the language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. Most word tokens primarily ensure textual coherence and are not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of reasoning beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm called Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). Coconut utilizes the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state, termed "continuous thought." Instead of decoding this state into words, we feed it back to the model as the next input embedding directly in the continuous space. This latent reasoning paradigm enables an advanced reasoning pattern, where continuous thoughts can encode multiple alternative next steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) rather than committing prematurely to a single deterministic path as in CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT on logical reasoning tasks that require substantial search during planning and achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing AI models rely on predefined objectives, static training data, and externally supplied feedback, which restrict their ability to adapt, reflect, and improve independently. In this paper, we propose the Active Thinking Model (ATM)- a unified cognitive framework that integrates goal reasoning, dynamic task generation, and self-reflective learning into an adaptive architecture. Unlike conventional systems that passively execute fixed procedures, ATM actively evaluates its performance through logical reasoning and environmental indicators, reuses effective methods to solve new problems, and generates novel strategies for unseen situations via a continuous self-improvement loop. A mathematically grounded theoretical analysis demonstrates that ATM can autonomously evolve from suboptimal to optimal behavior without external supervision and maintain bounded tracking regret under changing environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning. Within- and between-model performance varied heavily across tasks, indicating room for significant improvement in language model reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peer-...</summary><p>Peer-reviewed workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[From Memorization to Reasoning in the Spectrum of Loss Curvature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Abductive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12275v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs, which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex knowledge setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025, 22 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables.

Exploring the Frontiers of ChatGPT Atlas Agent in Web Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26298v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction, enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic, interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

Empowering Natural Language Proof Generation by Stepwise Decoding with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06736v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a pivotal component in the field of artificial intelligence. Proof planning, particularly in contexts requiring the validation of explanation accuracy, continues to present challenges. The recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant progress in natural language proof planning, evolving from one-stage generators to more complex three-stage systems that include additional searchers or verifiers. While these assisted methods improve the quality of generated results, they also introduce increased search efforts and computational costs. Furthermore, the generative process itself remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a stepwise decoding approach augmented by contrastive learning to address two common errors encountered during the LLM generator's decoding process. We fine-tune the language model using both vanilla and enhanced hard negatives to mitigate these decoding errors. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy. Additionally, our further analysis reveals that even larger LLMs still struggle to generate rigorous logical chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables.

Evaluating Interventions for Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15584v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust. Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with 400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making wrong reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance interventions in human-LLM collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25369v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that neither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of arbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce grounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation for formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive definitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e., "bottom") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing" terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar classical rules. A mechanically-checked consistency proof in Isabelle/HOL exists for the basic quantifier-free fragment of GA. Quantifiers may be added atop this foundation as ordinary computations, whose inference rules are thus admissible and do not introduce new inconsistency risks. While GA is only a first step towards richly-typed grounded deduction practical for everyday use in manual or automated computational reasoning, it shows the promise that the expressive freedom of arbitrary recursive definition can in principle be incorporated into formal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[p-less Sampling: A Robust Hyperparameter-Free Approach for LLM Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23234v4)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |

While many works have largely assumed well-defined tasks, real-world queries are often underspecified and only solvable by acquiring missing information. We formalize this information-gathering problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with partially-observed initial states, (3) GSM-Q: human-annotated grade school math problems with one unknown variable, and (4) GSME-Q: equation-based version of GSM-Q. The LLM must select the correct clarification question from multiple options. While current models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, they achieve only 40-50% accuracy on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis shows that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems is not sufficient for success on our benchmark: models struggle to identify the right question even when they can solve the fully specified version. This highlights the need for specifically optimizing models' information acquisition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/google-deepmind/questbench}</p></details> |

However, their application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks, with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.</p></details> |  |

Using the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) and its open-source implementation, PyETR, we programmatically generate 383 formally specified reasoning problems and evaluate 38 models. For each response, we judge logical correctness and, when incorrect, whether it matches an ETR-predicted fallacy. Two results stand out: (i) as a capability proxy (Chatbot Arena Elo) increases, a larger share of a model's incorrect answers are ETR-predicted fallacies $(\rho=0.360, p=0.0265)$, while overall correctness on this dataset shows no correlation with capability; (ii) reversing premise order significantly reduces fallacy production for many models, mirroring human order effects. Methodologically, PyETR provides an open-source pipeline for unbounded, synthetic, contamination-resistant reasoning tests linked to a cognitive theory, enabling analyses that focus on error composition rather than error rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightPlanner: Unleashing the Reasoning Capabilities of Lightweight Large Language Models in Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08508v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full research paper at K-CAP 2025</p></details> |

Existing recurrent state-space model (RSSM)-based world models depend on single-step statistical inference to capture the environment dynamics, and, hence, they are unable to perform long-term imagination tasks due to the accumulation of prediction errors. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose a novel dual-mind world model (DMWM) framework that integrates logical reasoning to enable imagination with logical consistency. DMWM is composed of two components: an RSSM-based System 1 (RSSM-S1) component that handles state transitions in an intuitive manner and a logic-integrated neural network-based System 2 (LINN-S2) component that guides the imagination process through hierarchical deep logical reasoning. The inter-system feedback mechanism is designed to ensure that the imagination process follows the logical rules of the real environment. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark tasks that require long-term planning from the DMControl suite. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields significant improvements in terms of logical coherence, trial efficiency, data efficiency and long-term imagination over the state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CreativityPrism: A Holistic Benchmark for Large Language Model Creativity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20091v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text, there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e., divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other - whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast, approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

| **[SimKO: Simple Pass@K Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14807v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (20 pages, 10 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/simko/)</p></details> |
