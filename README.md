| **[Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums. We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes. To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds. Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, includes full algorithmic framework and empirical validation.

| **[Quantum HyperNetworks: Training Binary Neural Networks in Quantum Superposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08292v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary neural networks, i.e., neural networks whose parameters and activations are constrained to only two possible values, offer a compelling avenue for the deployment of deep learning models on energy- and memory-limited devices. However, their training, architectural design, and hyperparameter tuning remain challenging as these involve multiple computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems. Here we introduce quantum hypernetworks as a mechanism to train binary neural networks on quantum computers, which unify the search over parameters, hyperparameters, and architectures in a single optimization loop. Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits. We represent our quantum hypernetworks as variational quantum circuits, and find that an optimal circuit depth maximizes the probability of finding performant binary neural networks. Our unified approach provides an immense scope for other applications in the field of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures including appendices.

| **[Cross-Problem Parameter Transfer in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: A Machine Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10733v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Approximation in Lattices and Semigroups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23990v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper deals with the following question: Suppose that there exist an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is $n$. The target is, for a given natural number $k < n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$. This paper is a complete version of an extended abstract that appeared at the 26th International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO).</p></details> |  |
| **[Multipass Linear Sketches for Geometric LP-Type Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11484v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LP-type problems such as the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB), Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Programming (LP), and Semidefinite Programming (SDP) are fundamental combinatorial optimization problems, with many important applications in machine learning applications such as classification, bioinformatics, and noisy learning. We study LP-type problems in several streaming and distributed big data models, giving $\varepsilon$-approximation linear sketching algorithms with a focus on the high accuracy regime with low dimensionality $d$, that is, when ${d < (1/\varepsilon)^{0.999}}$. Our main result is an $O(ds)$ pass algorithm with $O(s( \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)^{3d/s}) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d, \log (1/\varepsilon))$ space complexity in words, for any parameter $s \in [1, d \log (1/\varepsilon)]$, to solve $\varepsilon$-approximate LP-type problems of $O(d)$ combinatorial and VC dimension. Notably, by taking $s = d \log (1/\varepsilon)$, we achieve space complexity polynomial in $d$ and polylogarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$, presenting exponential improvements in $1/\varepsilon$ over current algorithms. We complement our results by showing lower bounds of $(1/\varepsilon)^{\Omega(d)}$ for any $1$-pass algorithm solving the $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation MEB and linear SVM problems, further motivating our multi-pass approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in APPROX 2025, 45 pages; Updated author information in v2</p></details> |
| **[Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator Can Solve Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization More Efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08053v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g., chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna, an open-source framework for HPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AutoML Conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Algorithms with Computational Language Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03190v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens. This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely classes.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[ProvideQ: A Quantum Optimization Toolbox](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07649v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted and accepted at the IEEE QSW 2025.

| **[Finding One Local Optimum Is Easy -- But What about Two?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07524v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class PLS (Polynomial Local Search) captures the complexity of finding a solution that is locally optimal and has proven to be an important concept in the theory of local search. It has been shown that local search versions of various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Graph Convolutional Branch and Bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03099v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article explores the integration of deep learning models into combinatorial optimization pipelines, specifically targeting NP-hard problems. Traditional exact algorithms for such problems often rely on heuristic criteria to guide the exploration of feasible solutions. In this work, we propose using neural networks to learn informative heuristics-most notably, an optimality score that estimates a solution's proximity to the optimum. This score is used to evaluate nodes within a branch-and-bound framework, enabling a more efficient traversal of the solution space. Focusing on the Traveling Salesman Problem, we describe two exact solvers-1-tree branch-and-bound and Concorde-and introduce a hybrid approach called Graph Convolutional Branch and Bound, which augments these solvers with a graph convolutional neural network along with a novel unsupervised training strategy that facilitates generalization to graphs of varying sizes without requiring labeled data. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a significant reduction in the number of explored branch-and-bound nodes and overall computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to European Journal of Operational Research</p></details> |
| **[Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005v5)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dataless Neural Networks for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05322v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem, our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling, traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120) are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated version of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure.

By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combination generators with optimal cache utilization and communication free parallel execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03980v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an efficient and elegant combination generator for producing all combinations of size less than or equal to K, designed for exhaustive generation and combinatorial optimization tasks. This generator can be implemented to achieve what we define as optimal efficiency: constant amortized time, optimal cache utilization, embarrassingly parallel execution, and a recursive structure compatible with pruning-based search. These properties are difficult to satisfy simultaneously in existing generators. For example, classical Gray code or lexicographic generators are typically list-based and sequentially defined, making them difficult to vectorized, inefficient in cache usage, and inherently hard to parallelize. Generators based on unranking methods, while easy to parallelize, are non-recursive. These limitations reduce their applicability in our target applications, where both computational efficiency and recursion are crucial. We adapt Bird's algebra of programming-style calculation to derive our algorithms, a formalism for developing correct-by-construction programs from specifications. As a result, all generators in this paper are first formulated in their clearest specification, and efficient definitions are derived constructively through equational reasoning, resulting in concise and elegant divide-and-conquer definitions. Beyond presenting a combination generator, we extend our approach to construct generators for K-permutations, nested combinations of combinations, and nested permutation-combination structures. To the best of our knowledge, the literature has not previously reported generators for these nested structures. We also develop sequential variants that produce configurations in Gray code-compatible orders -- such as the revolving door ordering -- which are particularly useful for constructing nested generators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Combinatorial Optimization: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03637v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This systematic review explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Combinatorial Optimization (CO). We report our findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We conduct a literature search via Scopus and Google Scholar, examining over 2,000 publications. We assess publications against four inclusion and four exclusion criteria related to their language, research focus, publication year, and type. Eventually, we select 103 studies. We classify these studies into semantic categories and topics to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, including the tasks performed by LLMs, the architectures of LLMs, the existing datasets specifically designed for evaluating LLMs in CO, and the field of application. Finally, we identify future directions for leveraging LLMs in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Approximation Algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing with Fixed Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16534v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is one of the most extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization. Based on customer demand, we distinguish three variants of CVRP: unit-demand, splittable, and unsplittable. In this paper, we consider $k$-CVRP in general metrics and on general graphs, where $k$ is the vehicle capacity. All three versions are APX-hard for any fixed $k\geq3$. Assume that the approximation ratio of metric TSP is $\frac{3}{2}$. We present a $(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm for the splittable and unit-demand cases, and a $(\frac{5}{2}+\ln2-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm for the unsplittable case. Our approximation ratio is better than the previous results when $k$ is less than a sufficiently large value, approximately $1.7\times10^7$. For small values of $k$, we design independent and elegant algorithms with further improvements. For the splittable and unit-demand cases, we improve the approximation ratio from $1.792$ to $1.500$ for $k=3$, and from $1.750$ to $1.500$ for $k=4$. For the unsplittable case, we improve the approximation ratio from $1.792$ to $1.500$ for $k=3$, from $2.051$ to $1.750$ for $k=4$, and from $2.249$ to $2.157$ for $k=5$. The approximation ratio for $k=3$ surprisingly achieves the same value as in the splittable case. Our techniques, such as EX-ITP -- an extension of the classic ITP method, have the potential to improve algorithms for other routing problems as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in MFCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LRM-1B: Towards Large Routing Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03300v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Dispatch for Job Shop Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10589v4)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated environments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex scheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD), an offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these limitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions are available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with simulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable variants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN (mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to learn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we present a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action spaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in an offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms online RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100 solutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset yields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the same amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications, where data is inherently noisy and imperfect.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Machine Learning</p></details> |

In this paper, we examine the robustness of FALQON against coherent control errors, a class of multiplicative errors that affect the control input. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically robust with respect to systematic errors, and we derive robustness bounds for independent errors. Finally, we propose a robust version of FALQON which minimizes a regularized Lyapunov function. Our theoretical results are supported through simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Running-time Analysis of ($μ+λ$) Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization Based on Multiple-gain Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02381v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights, a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Experimental Approach for Running-Time Estimation of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Numerical Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02372v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D, AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality Diversity Genetic Programming for Learning Scheduling Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02235v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions. Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges. This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the distribution of solutions unfolds over time.

In contrast to prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized) approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting, alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traveling Purchaser Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02476v6)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traveling purchaser problem (TPP) is an important combinatorial optimization problem with broad applications. Due to the coupling between routing and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route construction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to exact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated design but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction and purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution from a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a bipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product relations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite graph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant advantage of our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the policy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing plan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, by leveraging DRL, we can train the policy network towards optimizing the global solution objective. Furthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be trained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across instances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances that are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP instances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can significantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the optimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially on large-sized instances.</p></details> |  |

We consider features from the recently proposed compressed Pareto Local Optimal Solutions Networks (C-PLOS-net) model of combinatorial landscapes. The benchmark instances are a set of rmnk-landscapes with 2 and 3 objectives and various levels of ruggedness and objective correlation. We consider the performance of three algorithms -- Pareto Local Search (PLS), Global Simple EMO Optimizer (GSEMO), and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - using the resolution and hypervolume metrics. Our tailored analysis reveals feature combinations that influence algorithm performance specific to certain landscapes. This study provides deeper insights into feature importance, tailored to specific rmnk-landscapes and algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Initialization Method for Factorization Machine Based on Low-Rank Approximation for Constructing a Corrected Approximate Ising Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12747v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an initialization method that can approximate a given approximate Ising model with a high degree of accuracy using a factorization machine (FM), a machine learning model. The construction of an Ising models using an FM is applied to black-box combinatorial optimization problems using factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA). It is anticipated that the optimization performance of FMQA will be enhanced through an implementation of the warm-start method. Nevertheless, the optimal initialization method for leveraging the warm-start approach in FMQA remains undetermined. Consequently, the present study compares initialization methods based on random initialization and low-rank approximation, and then identifies a suitable one for use with warm-start in FMQA through numerical experiments. Furthermore, the properties of the initialization method by the low-rank approximation for the FM are analyzed using random matrix theory, demonstrating that the approximation accuracy of the proposed method is not significantly influenced by the specific Ising model under consideration. The findings of this study will facilitate advancements of research in the field of black-box combinatorial optimization through the use of Ising machines.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

These problems are often nuanced, their optimal solutions might not be efficiently obtainable, and they may require lots of time and compute resources to solve (they are NP-hard). It follows that the best course of action for solving these problems is to use general optimization algorithm paradigms to quickly and easily develop algorithms that are customized to these problems and can produce good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we present optimizn, a Python library for developing customized optimization algorithms under general optimization algorithm paradigms (simulated annealing, branch and bound). Additionally, optimizn offers continuous training, with which users can run their algorithms on a regular cadence, retain the salient aspects of previous runs, and use them in subsequent runs to potentially produce solutions that get closer and closer to optimality.

Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models, there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide future research and address emerging VRP variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review</p></details> |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |
| **[Alleviating CoD in Renewable Energy Profile Clustering Using an Optical Quantum Computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23569v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model. Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard clustering problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Courcelle's Theorem for Lipschitz Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21118v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lipschitz continuity of algorithms, introduced by Kumabe and Yoshida (FOCS'23), measures the stability of an algorithm against small input perturbations. Algorithms with small Lipschitz continuity are desirable, as they ensure reliable decision-making and reproducible scientific research. Several studies have proposed Lipschitz continuous algorithms for various combinatorial optimization problems, but these algorithms are problem-specific, requiring a separate design for each problem. To address this issue, we provide the first algorithmic meta-theorem in the field of Lipschitz continuous algorithms. Our result can be seen as a Lipschitz continuous analogue of Courcelle's theorem, which offers Lipschitz continuous algorithms for problems on bounded-treewidth graphs. Specifically, we consider the problem of finding a vertex set in a graph that maximizes or minimizes the total weight, subject to constraints expressed in monadic second-order logic (MSO_2). We show that for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with a polylogarithmic Lipschitz constant on bounded treewidth graphs. On such graphs, our result outperforms most existing Lipschitz continuous algorithms in terms of approximability and/or Lipschitz continuity. Further, we provide similar results for problems on bounded-clique-width graphs subject to constraints expressed in MSO_1. Additionally, we construct a Lipschitz continuous version of Baker's decomposition using our meta-theorem as a subroutine.</p></details> | ESA 2025, 27 pages |
| **[Time to Rethink AI for Combinatorial Optimization: Classical Algorithms Remain Tough to Match](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03669v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that the machine learning community should fundamentally rethink how AI-inspired methods are developed and evaluated for combinatorial optimization (CO). We present comprehensive empirical benchmarks comparing various recent AI-inspired GPU-based methods with several classical CPU-based solvers on the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Strikingly, even on in-distribution random graphs, leading AI-inspired methods are consistently outperformed by the state-of-the-art classical solver KaMIS, and some AI-inspired methods frequently fail to surpass even the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic. To better understand the source of these failures, we introduce a novel analysis, serialization, which reveals that non-backtracking AI methods, such as LTFT (based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic, and thus worse than KaMIS. Our findings reveal three core issues: (1) Limited benchmarks and evaluation - AI-inspired methods are often tested only on small instances with very limited inference time, which covers up issues with scalability and resource usage; (2) Intrinsic hardness and learning limits - even under ideal, in-distribution conditions, learning-based approaches lag behind classical heuristics, highlighting inherent barriers that receive little attention; and (3) Insufficient use and understanding of classical heuristics - current learning frameworks often neglect to incorporate effective classical techniques. Although we use MIS as a testbed, similar gaps and challenges have been reported in other combinatorial optimization problems, suggesting broader relevance for our recommendations. We propose that future research must address these issues by rigorous benchmarking, deepening understanding of learning limitations, and integrating classical heuristics into AI-inspired methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, 98 tables</p></details> |

As a combinatorial optimization problem, VRP plays a crucial role in a wide range of real world applications, particularly in transportation, logistics, and delivery systems, due to its diverse formulations and numerous extensions. Over the years, researchers have introduced various VRP variants to address specific operational constraints, emerging industry requirements and optimize specific objectives, making it one of the most extensively studied problems in operations research. This article provides a comprehensive overview of VRP by exploring its theoretical foundations, discussing the limitations of its classical model, and introducing its key extensions. By systematically reviewing the diverse constraints, objectives, and variants examined in recent literature, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of VRP while highlighting its ongoing evolution and relevance in modern optimization and decision making processes.</p></details> | 22 pages, 21 figures |

We investigate what Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of food production. We define a typology of design and prediction tasks based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with domain experts, and evaluate six LLMs on four tasks in our typology. For example, for a sustainable protein design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM can reduce time spent by 45% on average, compared to 22% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. However, for a sustainable menu design task, LLMs produce suboptimal solutions when instructed to consider both human satisfaction and climate impacts. We propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization to improve reasoning capabilities. Our approach decreases emissions of food choices by 79% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. Our results demonstrate LLMs' potential, supported by optimization techniques, to accelerate sustainable food development and adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML camera ready version</p></details> |

The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |

Building on a probabilistic interpretation via agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables, we derive an explicit closed-form formula for enumerating the vertices of the related polytope $1$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$. Our approach is based on a natural binary encoding of cut vectors and introduces the alternating cycle function, a map that generates integer sequences with palindromic and recursive structure. This encoding directly captures the vertex structure and reveals that the scaled encoded vertices, perhaps unexpectedly, exhibit an almost-linear behaviour. This work provides the first explicit vertex enumeration formula for this classical polytope family.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, models operating on Euclidean coordinates are ill-suited for non-Euclidean, asymmetric problem instances that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based solvers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Edge Clique Partition and Cover Beyond Independence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21216v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covering and partitioning the edges of a graph into cliques are classical problems at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and graph theory, having been studied through a range of algorithmic and complexity-theoretic lenses. Despite the well-known fixed-parameter tractability of these problems when parameterized by the total number of cliques, such a parameterization often fails to be meaningful for sparse graphs. In many real-world instances, on the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition can be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \alpha(G). Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \alpha parameterizations of the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and study Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\alpha) and Edge Clique Partition Above Independent Set (ECP/\alpha), where the goal is to cover or partition all edges of a graph using at most \alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is the parameter. Our main results reveal a distinct complexity landscape for the two variants. We show that ECP/\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas ECC/\alpha is NP-complete for all k \geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial time for k \in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between the two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a natural lower bound. Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k + \omega(G), where \omega(G) is the size of a maximum clique of the graph G. This result is particularly relevant for sparse graphs, in which \omega is typically small. For H-minor free graphs, we design a subexponential algorithm of running time f(H)^{\sqrt{k}}n^{O(1)}.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended abstract of this paper appears in the proceedings of ESA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Explainable quantum regression algorithm with encoded data structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03334v5)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising for solving practical problems such as combinatorial optimization, quantum chemistry simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum error correction on noisy quantum computers. However, with typical random ansatz or quantum alternating operator ansatz, derived variational quantum algorithms become a black box that cannot be trusted for model interpretation, not to mention deploying as applications in informing critical decisions: the results of these variational parameters are just rotational angles for the quantum gates and have nothing to do with interpretable values that a model can provide directly. In this paper, we construct the first interpretable quantum regression algorithm, in which the quantum state exactly encodes the classical data table and the variational parameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients, which are real numbers by construction, providing a high degree of model interpretability and minimal cost to optimize due to the right expressiveness. We also take advantage of the encoded data structure to reduce the time complexity of computing the regression map. To shorten the circuit depth for nonlinear regression, our algorithm can be extended by building nonlinear features by classical preprocessing as the independent encoded column vectors. Even though the realization of compressed encoding in superconducting qubits has been achieved by the less noisy compressed encoding recently by the authors, we envision potential quantum utilities with multi-qubit gates implemented in neutral cold atoms and ions.</p></details> |  |

At the core of the proposed machine is an asynchronous autoencoder architecture that captures higher-order interactions by directly manipulating Ising clauses instead of Ising spins, thereby maintaining resource complexity independent of interaction order. Asymptotic convergence to the Ising ground state is ensured by sampling the autoencoder latent space defined by the spins, based on the annealing dynamics of the Fowler-Nordheim quantum mechanical tunneling. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-SAT, comparing the results to those obtained using a second-order Ising machine employing the same annealing process. Our findings indicate that the proposed architecture consistently provides higher quality solutions in shorter time frames compared to the second-order model across multiple runs. Additionally, we show that the techniques based on the sparsity of the interconnection matrix, such as graph coloring, can be effectively applied to higher-order neuromorphic Ising machines, enhancing the solution quality and the time-to-solution. The time-to-solution can be further improved through hardware co-design, as demonstrated in this paper using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The results presented in this paper provide further evidence that autoencoders and Fowler-Nordheim annealers are sufficient to achieve reliability and scaling of any-order neuromorphic Ising machines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/HeurAgenix.</p></details> | 27 pages,9 figures |

Most existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various constraint tightness degrees.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.13904</p></details> |

However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values. Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority and strong generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Since Large Language Models~(LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content with a knowledge base that covers various domains, they offer potential ways to automatically optimize heuristics. To this end, we propose Planning of Heuristics~(PoH), an optimization method that integrates LLM self-reflection with Monte Carlo Tree Search, a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics~(states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions~(actions) and evaluation results~(rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The experimental results show that PoH outperforms hand-crafted heuristics and other Automatic Heuristic Design methods based on LLMs, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve tested COPs, especially with large sizes.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a nested NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI '25), Montreal, Canada, August 2025</p></details> |

At the test time, for each test instance, starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods. Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases. We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd W...</summary><p>2nd Workshop on Test-Time Adaptation: Putting Updates to the Test @ ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Breaking the O(mn)-Time Barrier for Vertex-Weighted Global Minimum Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11926v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem: given an undirected vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a minimum-weight subset of its vertices whose removal disconnects $G$. The problem is closely related to Global Minimum Edge-Cut, where the weights are on the graph edges instead of vertices, and the goal is to compute a minimum-weight subset of edges whose removal disconnects the graph. Global Minimum Cut is one of the most basic and extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. While an almost-linear time algorithm was known for the edge version of the problem for awhile (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), the fastest previous algorithm for the vertex version (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) achieves a running time of $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. For the special case of unit vertex weights, this bound was broken only recently (Li {et al.}, STOC 2021); their result, combined with the recent breakthrough almost-linear time algorithm for Maximum $s$-$t$ Flow (Chen {et al.}, FOCS 2022, van den Brand {et al.}, FOCS 2023), yields an almost-linear time algorithm for Global Minimum Vertex-Cut with unit vertex weights. In this paper we break the $28$ years old bound of Henzinger {et al.} for the general weighted Global Minimum Vertex-Cut, by providing a randomized algorithm for the problem with running time $O(\min\{mn^{0.99+o(1)},m^{1.5+o(1)}\})$.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the solvable-unsolvable transition due to noise-induced chaos in digital memcomputing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14928v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have been designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Generalization in Diffusion-Based Neural Combinatorial Solver via Inference Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12188v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GreedyPrune: Retenting Critical Visual Token Set for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13166v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image understanding tasks, their computational efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly on resource-constrained devices due to the high cost of processing large numbers of visual tokens. Recently, training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity. We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complexity Scaling Laws for Neural Models using Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12932v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.</p></details> | 45 pages, 20 figures |

However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages,5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Lifting Theorems for One-Way Number-on-Forehead Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12420v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifting theorems are one of the most powerful tools for proving communication lower bounds, with numerous downstream applications in proof complexity, monotone circuit lower bounds, data structures, and combinatorial optimization. However, to the best of our knowledge, prior lifting theorems have primarily focused on the two-party communication. In this paper, we propose a new lifting theorem that establishes connections between two-party communication and the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) communication model. Specifically, we present a deterministic lifting theorem that translates one-way two-party communication lower bounds into one-way NOF lower bounds. Our lifting theorem yields two applications. First, we obtain an optimal explicit separation between randomized and deterministic one-way NOF communication, even in the multi-player setting. This improves the prior square-root vs. constant separation for three players established by Kelley and Lyu (arXiv 2025). Second, we achieve optimal separations between one-round and two-round deterministic NOF communication, improving upon the previous separation of $\Omega(\frac{n^{1/(k-1)}}{k^k})$ vs. $O(\log n)$ for $k$ players, as shown by Viola and Wigderson (FOCS 2007). Beyond the lifting theorems, we also apply our techniques to the disjointness problem. In particular, we provide a new proof that the deterministic one-way three-party NOF communication complexity of set disjointness is $\Omega(n)$, further demonstrating the broader applicability of our methods.</p></details> | 16 pages |

These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, extended version of the presented and published at the 1st International Conference on Quantum Software (IQSOFT)</p></details> |

To overcome these limitations, QPanda3 has been extensively optimized as a high-performance quantum programming framework tailored for the demands of the NISQ era and quantum-classical hybrid workflows. It features optimized circuit compilation, a custom binary instruction stream (OriginBIS), and hardware-aware execution strategies to significantly reduce latency and communication overhead. OriginBIS achieves up to 86.9$\times$ faster encoding and 35.6$\times$ faster decoding than OpenQASM 2.0, addressing critical bottlenecks in hybrid quantum systems. Benchmarks show 10.7$\times$ compilation speedup and up to 597$\times$ acceleration in compiling large-scale circuits (e.g., a 118-qubit W-state) compared to Qiskit. n high-performance simulation, QPanda3 excels in variational quantum algorithms, achieving up to 26$\times$ faster gradient computation than Qiskit, with minimal time-complexity growth across circuit depths. These capabilities make QPanda3 well-suited for scalable quantum algorithm development in finance, materials science, and combinatorial optimization, while supporting industrial deployment and cloud-based execution in quantum-classical hybrid computing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

While traditional solvers dominate, large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for structured reasoning, yet struggle with complex GCO tasks requiring rigorous combinatorial analysis and multi-step deduction, often producing hallucinated steps. We first formalize the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem, which provides a structured guidance for producing high-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Building on this formulation, we introduce GraphThought, a novel framework that generates effective reasoning sequences through either heuristic-guided forward search or solver-aligned backward reasoning. By fine-tuning LLMs on these structured thought sequences, we develop Llama-GT, an 8B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraphArena benchmark, outperforming significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3. Our results demonstrate that when scaffolded with structured reasoning priors, principled thought generation can significantly enhance LLM performance on GCO tasks without requiring increased model scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

The Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DQAOA) addresses high-dimensional, dense problems using current quantum computing techniques and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. In this work, we improve the scalability and efficiency of DQAOA through advanced problem decomposition and parallel execution using message passing on the Frontier CPU/GPU supercomputer. Our approach ensures efficient quantum-classical workload management by distributing large problem instances across classical and quantum resources. Experimental results demonstrate that enhanced decomposition strategies and GPU-accelerated quantum simulations significantly improve DQAOA's performance, achieving up to 10x speedup over CPU-based simulations. This advancement enables better scalability for large problem instances, supporting the practical deployment of GPU systems for hybrid quantum-classical applications. We also highlight ongoing integration efforts using the Quantum Framework (QFw) to support future HPC-quantum computing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Min-Max Control Barrier Functions For Switched Affine Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10296v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of synthesizing non-smooth control barrier functions (CBFs) for continuous-time switched affine systems. Switched affine systems are defined by a set of affine dynamical modes, wherein the control consists of a state-based switching signal that determines the current operating mode. The control barrier functions seek to maintain the system state inside a control invariant set that excludes a given set of unsafe states. We consider CBFs that take the form of pointwise minima and maxima over a finite set of affine functions. Our approach uses ideas from nonsmooth analysis to formulate conditions for min- and max- affine control barrier functions. We show how a feedback switching law can be extracted from a given CBF. Next, we show how to automate the process of synthesizing CBFs given a system description through a tree-search algorithm inspired by branch-and-cut methods from combinatorial optimization. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a series of interesting examples of switched affine systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14409v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |

While the QAOA is well studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes) required for the QAOA. For our main result, we (i) leverage a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of the QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds of the QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii) show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective functions, and when the problem can be modeled as a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the conventional transverse-field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded-occurrence local cost problems and for all strictly $k$-local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with a constant-round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. Using our proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound for unstructured search and, with small modification, show that our bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, comments welcome, close to the published version</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Design Structure Matrix Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an extended version of our papers presented at the 38th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2022) and the 24th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2022), accepted for publication in Logical Methods in Computer Science journal</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Heuristics Generation for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12627v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies exploited Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate heuristics for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), by prompting LLMs to first provide search directions and then derive heuristics accordingly. However, the absence of task-specific knowledge in prompts often leads LLMs to provide unspecific search directions, obstructing the derivation of well-performing heuristics. Moreover, evaluating the derived heuristics remains resource-intensive, especially for those semantically equivalent ones, often requiring omissible resource expenditure. To enable LLMs to provide specific search directions, we propose the Hercules algorithm, which leverages our designed Core Abstraction Prompting (CAP) method to abstract the core components from elite heuristics and incorporate them as prior knowledge in prompts. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of CAP in reducing unspecificity and provide empirical results in this work. To reduce computing resources required for evaluating the derived heuristics, we propose few-shot Performance Prediction Prompting (PPP), a first-of-its-kind method for the Heuristic Generation (HG) task. PPP leverages LLMs to predict the fitness values of newly derived heuristics by analyzing their semantic similarity to previously evaluated ones. We further develop two tailored mechanisms for PPP to enhance predictive accuracy and determine unreliable predictions, respectively. The use of PPP makes Hercules more resource-efficient and we name this variant Hercules-P. Extensive experiments across four HG tasks, five COPs, and eight LLMs demonstrate that Hercules outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based HG algorithms, while Hercules-P excels at minimizing required computing resources. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of CAP, PPP, and the other proposed mechanisms by conducting relevant ablation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

One nice property of their clustering, shown in previous work by Chang, Dani, Hayes, and Pettie (PODC 2020), is that distances in the cluster graph are rescaled versions of distances in the original graph, up to an $O(\log n)$ distortion factor and rounding issues. Minimizing this distortion factor is important for efficiency in computing the clustering, as well as in further applications, once the clustering has been constructed. We prove that there exist graphs for which an $\Omega((\log n)^{1/3})$ distortion factor is necessary for any clustering. We also consider a class of nice graphs which we call uniformly bounded independence graphs. These include, for example, paths, lattice graphs, and "dense" unit disk graphs. For these graphs, we prove that clusterings of constant distortion always exist, and moreover, we give an efficient distributed algorithm to construct them. Our clustering algorithm is based on Voronoi cells centered at the vertices of a maximal independent set in a suitable power graph. Applications of our new clustering include low-energy simulation of distributed algorithms in the LOCAL, CONGEST, and RADIO-CONGEST models, as well as efficient approximate solutions to distributed combinatorial optimization problems. We complement these results with matching or nearly matching lower bounds.</p></details> |  |

| **[N Bugs on a Circle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13333v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe and analyze a generalization of the classic ``Four Bugs on a Square'' cyclic pursuit problem. Instead of allowing the bugs to spiral towards one another, we constrain $N$ bugs to the perimeter of the unit circle. Depending on their configuration, each bug moves either clockwise or counterclockwise with a constant angular speed, or remains stationary. Unlike the original problem where bugs always coalesce, this generalization produces three possible steady states: all bugs coalescing to a single point, clusters of bugs located at two antipodal points, or bugs entering a stable infinite chase cycle where they never meet. We analyze the stability of these steady states and calculate the probability that randomly initialized bugs reach each state. For $N \leq 4$, we derive exact analytical expressions for these probabilities. For larger values, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of coalescing, finding it approximately follows an inverse square root relationship with the number of bugs. This generalization reveals rich dynamical behaviors that are absent in the classic problem. Our analysis provides insight into how restricting the bugs to the circle's perimeter fundamentally alters the long-term behavior of pursuing agents compared to unrestricted pursuit problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Accelerated Mixing of the No-U-turn Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13259v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress on the theory of variational hypocoercivity established that Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo -- at criticality -- can achieve pronounced acceleration in its convergence and hence sampling performance over diffusive dynamics. Manual critical tuning being unfeasible in practice has motivated automated algorithmic solutions, notably the No-U-turn Sampler. Beyond its empirical success, a rigorous study of this method's ability to achieve accelerated convergence has been missing. We initiate this investigation combining a concentration of measure approach to examine the automatic tuning mechanism with a coupling based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In certain Gaussian target distributions, this yields a precise characterization of the sampler's behavior resulting, in particular, in rigorous mixing guarantees describing the algorithm's ability and limitations in achieving accelerated convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relation-Aware Slicing in Cross-Domain Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13194v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

This validation is usually done by historical control limits (HCL), which should cover the observations of the concurrent control with a predefined level of confidence. In many applications, HCL are applied to dichotomous data, e.g. the number of rats with a tumor vs. the number of rats without a tumor (carcinogenicity studies) or the number of cells with a micronucleus out of a total number of cells. Dichotomous HCD may be overdispersed and can be heavily right- (or left-) skewed, which is usually not taken into account in the practical applications of HCL. To overcome this problem, four different prediction intervals (two frequentist, two Bayesian), that can be applied to such data, are proposed. Based on comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations, the coverage probabilities of the proposed prediction intervals were compared to heuristical HCL typically used in daily toxicological routine (historical range, limits of the np-chart, mean plus minus 2 SD). Our simulations reveal, that frequentist bootstrap calibrated prediction intervals control the type-1-error best, but, also prediction intervals calculated based on Bayesian generalized linear mixed models appear to be practically applicable. Contrary, all heuristics fail to control the type-1-error. The application of HCL is demonstrated based on a real life data set containing historical controls from long-term carcinogenicity studies run on behalf of the U.S. National Toxicology Program. The proposed frequentist prediction intervals are publicly available from the R package predint, whereas R code for the computation of the two Bayesian prediction intervals is provided via GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[MC$^2$A: Enabling Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design for Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12935v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units, reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$, $1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures, IEEE journal paper</p></details> |

Borrowing techniques from Malliavin calculus, we compute estimates for the Radon-Nikodym derivative for processes on $L^2([0, T); \mathbb{R}^d)$ which may anticipate the Brownian motion, in the sense that they may not be adapted to the filtration at the same time. Applying these to various popular midpoint discretizations, we are able to improve the regularity and cross-regularity results in the literature on sampling methods. We also obtain a query complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\kappa^{5/4} d^{1/4}}{\varepsilon^{1/2}})$ for obtaining a $\varepsilon^2$-accurate sample in $\mathsf{KL}$ divergence, under log-concavity and strong smoothness assumptions for $\nabla^2 V$.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIDEE: Visual and Interactive Decomposition, Execution, and Evaluation of Text Analytics with Intelligent Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21582v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service. Using this framework, we propose several solutions to achieve a reduction in both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that model predictive control using a time series forecast can significantly reduce station operator costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Approach to Design Bayesian Platform Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12647v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Platform trials evaluate multiple experimental treatments against a common control group (and/or against each other), which often reduces the trial duration and sample size. Bayesian platform designs offer several practical advantages, including the flexible addition or removal of experimental arms using posterior probabilities and the incorporation of prior/external information. Regulatory agencies require that the operating characteristics of Bayesian designs are assessed by estimating the sampling distribution of posterior probabilities via Monte Carlo simulation. It is computationally intensive to repeat this simulation process for all design configurations considered, particularly for platform trials with complex interim decision procedures. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to assess operating characteristics and determine sample sizes as well as other design parameters for Bayesian platform trials. We prove theoretical results that allow us to model the joint sampling distribution of posterior probabilities across multiple endpoints and trial stages using simulations conducted at only two sample sizes. This work is motivated by design complexities in the SSTARLET trial, an ongoing Bayesian adaptive platform trial for tuberculosis preventive therapies (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06498414). Our proposed design method is not only computationally efficient but also capable of accommodating intricate, real-world trial constraints like those encountered in SSTARLET.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Fast Approximate Rank Determination and Selection with Group Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12634v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppose that a group test operation is available for checking order relations in a set, can this speed up problems like finding the minimum/maximum element, rank determination and selection? We consider a one-sided group test to be available, where queries are of the form $u \le_Q V$ or $V \le_Q u$, and the answer is `yes' if and only if there is some $v \in V$ such that $u \le v$ or $v \le u$, respectively. We restrict attention to total orders and focus on query-complexity; for min or max finding, we give a Las Vegas algorithm that makes $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 n)$ expected queries. We also give randomized approximate algorithms for rank determination and selection; we allow a relative error of $1 \pm \delta$ for $\delta > 0$ in the estimated rank or selected element. In this case, we give a Monte Carlo algorithm for approximate rank determination with expected query complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\delta^2 - \log \epsilon)$, where $1-\epsilon$ is the probability that the algorithm succeeds. We also give a Monte Carlo algorithm for approximate selection that has expected query complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(-\log( \epsilon \delta^2) / \delta^4)$; it has probability at least $\frac{1}{2}$ to output an element $x$, and if so, $x$ has the desired approximate rank with probability $1-\epsilon$.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Basket Trial Design Using Local Power Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15352v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, basket trials, which allow the evaluation of an experimental therapy across multiple tumor types within a single protocol, have gained prominence in early-phase oncology development. Unlike traditional trials, which evaluate each tumor type separately and often face challenges with limited sample sizes, basket trials offer the advantage of borrowing information across various tumor types to enhance statistical power. However, a key challenge in designing basket trials is determining the appropriate extent of information borrowing while maintaining an acceptable type I error rate control. In this paper, we propose a novel 3-component local power prior (local-PP) framework that introduces a dynamic and flexible approach to information borrowing. The framework consists of three components: global borrowing control, pairwise similarity assessments, and a borrowing threshold, allowing for tailored and interpretable borrowing across heterogeneous tumor types. Unlike many existing Bayesian methods that rely on computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the proposed approach provides a closed-form solution, significantly reducing computation time in large-scale simulations for evaluating operating characteristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed local-PP framework performs comparably to more complex methods while significantly shortening computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Biometrical Journal</p></details> |
| **[Fast Variational Bayes for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12251v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent variational Bayes methods for geospatial regression, proposed as an alternative to computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, have leveraged Nearest Neighbor Gaussian processes (NNGP) to achieve scalability. Yet, these variational methods remain inferior in accuracy and speed compared to spNNGP, the state-of-the-art MCMC-based software for NNGP. We introduce spVarBayes, a suite of fast variational Bayesian approaches for large-scale geospatial data analysis using NNGP. Our contributions are primarily computational. We replace auto-differentiation with a combination of calculus of variations, closed-form gradient updates, and linear response corrections for improved variance estimation. We also accommodate covariates (fixed effects) in the model and offer inference on the variance parameters. Simulation experiments demonstrate that we achieve comparable accuracy to spNNGP but with reduced computational costs, and considerably outperform existing variational inference methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. Analysis of a large forest canopy height dataset illustrates the practical implementation of proposed methods and shows that the inference results are consistent with those obtained from the MCMC approach. The proposed methods are implemented in publicly available Github R-package spVarBayes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Impact of Covariate Distribution and Positivity Violation on Weighting-Based Indirect Comparisons: a Simulation Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12241v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons (PAICs) are used to estimate treatment effects when direct comparisons are infeasible and individual patient data (IPD) are only available for one trial. Among PAIC methods, Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) is the most widely used. However, little is known about how MAIC performs under challenging conditions such as limited covariate overlap or markedly non-normal covariate distributions. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study comparing three estimators: (i) MAIC matching first moment (MAIC-1), (ii) MAIC matching first and second moments (MAIC-2), and (iii) a benchmark method leveraging full IPD -- Propensity Score Weighting (PSW). We examined eight scenarios ranging from ideal conditions to situations with positivity violations and non-normal (including bimodal) covariate distributions. We assessed both anchored and unanchored estimators and examined the impact of adjustment model misspecification. We also applied these estimators to real-world data from the AKIKI and AKIKI-2 trials, comparing renal replacement therapy strategies in critically ill patients. MAIC-1 demonstrated robust performance, remaining unbiased in the presence of moderate positivity violations and non-normal covariates, while MAIC-2 and PSW appeared more sensitive to positivity violations. All methods showed substantial bias when key confounders were omitted, emphasizing the importance of correct model specification. In real-world data, a consistent trend was found with MAIC-1 showing narrower confidence intervals with positivity violation. Our findings support the cautious use of unanchored MAICs and highlight MAIC-1's resilience across moderate violations of assumptions. However, the method's limited flexibility underscores the need for careful use in real-world settings.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

It proposes a generative model that integrates effects of spatially-varying inputs and a network-valued input using deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear and spatial associations with the output. The method models spatial smoothness, accounts for subject heterogeneity and complex associations between network and spatial images at different scales, enables accurate inference of each images effect on the output image, and allows prediction with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout, contributing to one of the first Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks for heterogeneous imaging data. The model is highly scalable to high-resolution data without the heavy pre-processing or summarization often required by Bayesian methods. Empirical results demonstrate its strong performance compared to existing statistical and deep learning methods. We applied the XAI model to the ABCD data which revealed associations between cortical features and ALFF throughout the entire brain. Our model performed comparably to existing methods in predictive accuracy but provided superior uncertainty quantification and faster computation, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale neuroimaging analysis. Open-source software in Python for XAI is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatRL: Provably Generalizable Iterative Algorithm Discovery via Monte-Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03833v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that outperform various baselines in the literature.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.</p></details> |  |

This scaling challenge limits the efficiency of Euclidean-based approximate inference methods. Motivated by the geometric connections between trees and hyperbolic space, we develop novel hyperbolic extensions of two sequential search algorithms: Combinatorial and Nested Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (\textsc{Csmc} and \textsc{Ncsmc}). Our approach introduces consistent and unbiased estimators, along with variational inference methods (\textsc{H-Vcsmc} and \textsc{H-Vncsmc}), which outperform their Euclidean counterparts. Empirical results demonstrate improved speed, scalability and performance in high-dimensional phylogenetic inference tasks.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Training neural control variates using correlated configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07719v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the 3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of 1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures.

We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains. Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Variational Inference for Multinomial Probit Models under Large Choice Sets and Sample Sizes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10945v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multinomial probit (MNP) model is widely used to analyze categorical outcomes due to its ability to capture flexible substitution patterns among alternatives. Conventional likelihood based and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimators become computationally prohibitive in high dimensional choice settings. This study introduces a fast and accurate conditional variational inference (CVI) approach to calibrate MNP model parameters, which is scalable to large samples and large choice sets. A flexible variational distribution on correlated latent utilities is defined using neural embeddings, and a reparameterization trick is used to ensure the positive definiteness of the resulting covariance matrix. The resulting CVI estimator is similar to a variational autoencoder, with the variational model being the encoder and the MNP's data generating process being the decoder. Straight through estimation and Gumbel SoftMax approximation are adopted for the argmax operation to select an alternative with the highest latent utility. This eliminates the need to sample from high dimensional truncated Gaussian distributions, significantly reducing computational costs as the number of alternatives grows. The proposed method achieves parameter recovery comparable to MCMC. It can calibrate MNP parameters with 20 alternatives and one million observations in approximately 28 minutes roughly 36 times faster and more accurate than the existing benchmarks in recovering model parameters.</p></details> | 35pages, 19figures |
| **[Regression modeling for cure factors on uterine cancer data using the reparametrized defective generalized Gompertz distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10902v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical research have improved survival outcomes for patients with life-threatening diseases. As a result, the existence of long-term survivors from these illnesses is becoming common. However, conventional models in survival analysis assume that all individuals remain at risk of death after the follow-up, disregarding the presence of a cured subpopulation. An important methodological advancement in this context is the use of defective distributions. In the defective models, the survival function converges to a constant value $p \in (0,1)$ as a function of the parameters. Among these models, the defective generalized Gompertz distribution (DGGD) has emerged as a flexible approach. In this work, we introduce a reparametrized version of the DGGD that incorporates the cure parameter and accommodates covariate effects to assess individual-level factors associated with long-term survival. A Bayesian model is presented, with parameter estimation via the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. A simulation study demonstrates good asymptotic results of the estimation process under vague prior information. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world dataset of uterine cancer patients. Our results reveal statistically significant protective effects of surgical intervention, alongside elevated risk associated with age over 50, diagnosis at the metastatic stage, and treatment with chemotherapy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error estimation for quasi-Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00150v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling can attain far better accuracy than plain Monte Carlo sampling. However, with plain Monte Carlo sampling it is much easier to estimate the attained accuracy. This article describes methods old and new to quantify the error in quasi-Monte Carlo estimates. An important challenge in this setting is that the goal of getting accuracy conflicts with that of estimating the attained accuracy. A related challenge is that rigorous uncertainty quantifications can be extremely conservative. A recent surprise is that some RQMC estimates have nearly symmetric distributions and that has the potential to allow confidence intervals that do not require either a central limit theorem or a consistent variance estimate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coverage errors for Student's t confidence intervals comparable to those in Hall (1988)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07645v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table 1 of Hall (1988) contains asymptotic coverage error formulas for some nonparametric approximate 95\% confidence intervals for the mean based on $n$ IID samples. The table includes an entry for an interval based on the central limit theorem using Gaussian quantiles and the Gaussian maximum likelihood variance estimate. It is missing an entry for the very widely used Student's $t$ confidence intervals. This note develops such a formula. The impetus to revisit this issue arose from the surprisingly robust performance of confidence intervals based on Student's t statistic in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. Hall's table had $0.14\kappa -2.12\gamma^2-3.35$ for normal theory intervals; the corresponding entry for Student's $t$ is $0.14\kappa -2.12\gamma^2$. An earlier version of this note reported that it corrected some coverage error formulas in Hall (1988). Two-sided errors take the form $2\Phi^{-1}(0.975)(A\kappa + \gamma^2+C)\varphi(1.96)/n +O(1/n^{3/2})$ where the error may well be $O(n^{-2})$. Hall's table showed $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)(A\kappa + B\gamma^2+C)$. The version intended as a correction had $2(A\kappa + B\gamma^2+C)$, wider by about $2/1.96\doteq1.02$. So, Hall's table really is proportional to the two-sided coverage errors.</p></details> |  |

The framework translates infinite-dimensional optimization dynamics into tractable parameter-space algorithms through a Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz. This perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating seismic inversion and uncertainty quantification with efficient high-rank Hessian approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10804v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient high-rank approximations of the Hessian can accelerate seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) and uncertainty quantification (UQ). In FWI, approximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for Newton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and improving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian approximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the efficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale problems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products, and performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave equations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank methods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We adapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread function method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building on an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that unifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic quadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that these high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational costs in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a low-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little meaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and underestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is overestimated, providing false confidence. In contrast, MCMC samples generated using the high-rank Hessian approximations provide meaningful statistical information about the posterior and more accurately assess the posterior variance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a neural-surrogate (neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven, likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, for all associated codes and files, see https://github.com/BrightManu-lang/SPN-param-recovery.git</p></details> |

Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments. Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 21 figures, submitted to journal for potential publication</p></details> |

This construction extends the classical multivariate t family by allowing both asymmetry and non-centrality, which provides an alternative to existing skew t models that often rely on restrictive assumptions for tractability. We derive key theoretical properties of the NCST distribution, which includes its moment structure, affine transformation behavior, and the distribution of quadratic forms. Due to the lack of a closed-form density, we implement a Monte Carlo likelihood approximation to enable maximum likelihood estimation and evaluate its performance through simulation studies. To demonstrate practical utility, we apply the NCST model to breast cancer diagnostic data, modeling multiple features of tumor shape. The NCST model achieves a superior fit based on information criteria and visual diagnostics, particularly in the presence of skewness and heavy tails compared to standard alternatives, including the multivariate normal, skew normal, and Azzalini's skew $t$ distribution. Our findings suggest that the NCST distribution offers a useful and interpretable choice for modeling complex multivariate data, which highlights promising directions for future development in likelihood inference, Bayesian computation, and applications involving asymmetry and non-Gaussian dependence.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

As light penetrates the sample scattering events occur that alter the propagation direction of the photons in a random manner leading degradation of image quality. The distribution of the scattered light does, however, give a measure of the optical properties such as the reduced scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient. Unfortunately, inverting scattering patterns to recover the optical properties is not simple especially in the regime where the light is partially randomized. Machine learning has been proposed by several authors as a means of recovering these properties from either the back scattered or the transmitted light. In the present paper we train a general purpose convolutional neural network RESNET 50 with simulated data based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show that compared with previous work our approach gives comparable or better reconstruction accuracy with training on a much smaller dataset. Moreover, by training on multiple parameters such as the intensity distribution at multiple planes or the exit angle and spatial distribution one achieves improved performance compared to training on a single input such as the intensity distribution captured at the sample surface. While our approach gives good parameter reconstruction, we identify factors that limit accuracy of the recovered properties, particularly the absorption coefficient. In the light of these limitations, we suggest how the present approach may be enhanced for even better performance.</p></details> |  |

These results prove the existence of long-run equilibrium relationships between functionals evaluated at different threshold values; as a statistical application, we discuss a frequency-domain estimator for the Adler-Taylor metric factor, i.e., the variance of the field's gradient. Our results are illustrated also by Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> |  |

For examples, there are two discrete analogues to the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). As motivated by Hamiltonian-Assisted Metropolis Sampling (HAMS), we propose Discrete HAMS (DHAMS), a discrete sampler which, for the first time, not only exploits gradient information but also incorporates a Gaussian momentum variable and samples a Hamiltonian as an augmented distribution. DHAMS is derived through several steps, including an auxiliary-variable proposal scheme, negation and gradient correction for the momentum variable, and over-relaxation for the state variable. Two distinctive properties are achieved simultaneously. One is generalized detailed balance, which enables irreversible exploration of the target distribution. The other is a rejection-free property for a target distribution with a linear potential function. In experiments involving both ordinal and binary distributions, DHAMS algorithms consistently yield superior performance compared with existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |

This work investigates the behavior of failure extropy in the multidimensional setting under dependence structures, with the objective of establishing theoretical bounds. We also introduce a novel vector-valued bivariate dynamic failure extropy (BDFEx) whose components, termed as conditional failure extropy (CFEx), capture component-wise conditional uncertainty. For CFEx, we derive several bounds and characterizations, contributing to its theoretical foundation. A new stochastic order based on CFEx has also been introduced and studied. To support empirical analysis, we propose an estimator for CFEx and evaluate its performance via Monte Carlo simulation, demonstrating its accuracy under various scenarios.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

We prove that the expected denoiser output under the forward corruption distribution recovers the true posterior, and that a simple Monte Carlo estimator converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)) with finite-sample concentration bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce an inference-time ensemble that runs K independent denoising passes and aggregates both posterior means and variances without any extra training. On WikiText-2, our MC-marginal sampler recovers the analytic lambda-DCE zero-shot perplexity (approximately 39) to within a few points at K=128, and its per-token variance shows a strong rank correlation with reconstruction error (Spearman rho = 0.996). This cost-proportional procedure yields calibrated uncertainty estimates and a direct trade-off between compute and posterior fidelity in discrete diffusion LMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |

| **[CSC-MPPI: A Novel Constrained MPPI Framework with DBSCAN for Reliable Obstacle Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16386v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes Constrained Sampling Cluster Model Predictive Path Integral (CSC-MPPI), a novel constrained formulation of MPPI designed to enhance trajectory optimization while enforcing strict constraints on system states and control inputs. Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |

Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |

We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints.

This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The software and case studies are available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>feedb...</summary><p>feedback welcome, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We propose a novel test termed {\alpha}-Energy Based Test ({\alpha}-EBT) to compare the multivariate distributions of two (or more) compositional data sets. Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rényi-infinity constrained sampling with $d^3$ membership queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12967v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform sampling over a convex body is a fundamental algorithmic problem, yet the convergence in KL or R\'enyi divergence of most samplers remains poorly understood. In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

With this work we aim to provide an integrative view and framework to combine methods from the fields of MCMC, constrained optimization, as well as robotics, and gain insights in their strengths from empirical evaluations. We propose NLP Sampling as a general problem formulation, propose a family of restarting two-phase methods as a framework to integrated methods from across the fields, and evaluate them on analytical and robotic manipulation planning problems. Complementary to this, we provide several conceptual discussions, e.g. on the role of Lagrange parameters, global sampling, and the idea of a Diffused NLP and a corresponding model-based denoising sampler.</p></details> |  |

The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm for approximate sampling from distributions whose support is a compact and convex set. This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Penalized Overdamped and Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00570v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution $\pi(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ when $x$ is constrained to lie on a convex body $\mathcal{C}$. Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |

A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

Furthermore, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and derive closed-form expressions for all aforementioned metrics. We then formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the real-time reconstruction error subject to a sampling cost constraint. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Reconstruction of Markov Sources and Remote Actuation over Wireless Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13927v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the real-time tracking and reconstruction of an information source with the purpose of actuation. A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Constrained Sampling from Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12558v2)** | 2022-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained language models generate fluent text but are notoriously hard to controllably sample from. In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Efficient constrained sampling via the mirror-Langevin algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16212v2)** | 2021-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new discretization of the mirror-Langevin diffusion and give a crisp proof of its convergence. Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01581v4)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Back-translation for Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08712v1)** | 2021-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper illustrates our approach to the shared task on large-scale multilingual machine translation in the sixth conference on machine translation (WMT-21). This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS4Net: Two-Stage Sample Selective Strategy for Rotating Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03116v1)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using the Prior Implicit in a Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13640v3)** | 2021-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior probability models are a fundamental component of many image processing problems, but density estimation is notoriously difficult for high-dimensional signals such as photographic images. Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

To the best of our knowledge, SSCA has not been used for solving federated optimization, and federated optimization with nonconvex constraints has not been investigated. Next, we customize the two proposed SSCA-based algorithms to two application examples, and provide closed-form solutions for the respective approximate convex problems at each iteration of SSCA. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate inherent advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed, communication cost and model specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICC 2021</p></details> |

They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |

How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |

This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |

However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |

Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

This is the case e.g. with strictly positive data and with compositional data, like percentages and the like.

The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

This hampers real-world applicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In addition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the reliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces calendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the growing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the T3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland, which allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in classification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With just 10% of the training labels, it outperforms the current baseline in both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, and by the end of June, it achieves a performance similar to the full-season baseline model.</p></details> | under review |
| **[MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.

| **[The Power of Architecture: Deep Dive into Transformer Architectures for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13043v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However, existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs, enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models, reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in LTSF.

However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in Chaos, May 2025</p></details> |

While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures.

Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed when compared with the product-line approach.

Despite advances in multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy: time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on low-end or wearable devices.</p></details> |  |

The primary objective of this project was to explore the potential for using thermocouple temperatures as predictors for estimating the TKE produced by a wildland fire. Machine learning models, including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian Process Regressor, are employed to assess the potential for thermocouple temperature perturbations to predict TKE values. Data visualization and correlation analyses reveal patterns and relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into the underlying dynamics. The project achieves high accuracy in predicting TKE by employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant success, particularly from regression models, in accurately estimating the TKE. The research findings contribute to fire behavior and smoke modeling science, emphasizing the importance of incorporating machine learning approaches and identifying complex relationships between fine-scale fire behavior and turbulence. Accurate TKE estimation using thermocouple temperatures allows for the refinement of models that can inform decision-making in fire management strategies, facilitate effective risk mitigation, and optimize fire management efforts.

High levels of CPU can slow down investments in green technologies, make regulatory planning more difficult, and increase public resistance to climate reforms, especially during times of economic stress. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting the US CPU index by building the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model with a large set of covariates, including economic indicators, financial cycle data, and public sentiments captured through Google Trends. The key strength of the BSTS model lies in its ability to efficiently manage a large number of covariates through its dynamic feature selection mechanism based on the spike-and-slab prior. To validate the effectiveness of the selected features of the BSTS model, an impulse response analysis is performed. The results show that macro-financial shocks impact CPU in different ways over time. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the BSTS model with exogenous variables on the US CPU dataset over different forecasting horizons. The empirical results confirm that BSTS consistently outperforms classical and deep learning frameworks, particularly for semi-long-term and long-term forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12257v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09888v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation in Time Series Forecasting through Inverted Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11439v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, iTransformer is one of the most popular and effective models for multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Thanks to its inverted framework, iTransformer effectively captures multivariate correlation. However, the inverted framework still has some limitations. It diminishes temporal interdependency information, and introduces noise in cases of nonsignificant variable correlation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel data augmentation method on inverted framework, called DAIF. Unlike previous data augmentation methods, DAIF stands out as the first real-time augmentation specifically designed for the inverted framework in MTS forecasting. We first define the structure of the inverted sequence-to-sequence framework, then propose two different DAIF strategies, Frequency Filtering and Cross-variation Patching to address the existing challenges of the inverted framework. Experiments across multiple datasets and inverted models have demonstrated the effectiveness of our DAIF.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

The age distribution of death counts is an example of constrained data, which are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. A centered log-ratio transformation is used to remove the constraints. With a time series of unconstrained data, we introduce our bootstrap method to construct prediction intervals, thereby quantifying forecast uncertainty. The bootstrap method utilizes a dynamic factor model to capture both nonstationary and stationary patterns through a two-stage functional principal component analysis. To capture parameter uncertainty, the estimated principal component scores and model residuals are sampled with replacement. Using the age- and sex-specific life-table deaths for Australia and the United Kingdom, we study the empirical coverage probabilities and compare them with the nominal ones. The bootstrap method has superior interval forecast accuracy, especially for the one-step-ahead forecast horizon.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

In graphs derived from time-series data or protein structures, a natural total ordering of vertices often arises from their underlying structure, such as temporal sequences or amino acid sequences. This motivates the study of problem variants that respect this inherent ordering. This paper addresses Ordered (Induced) Subgraph Isomorphism (O(I)SI) and its generalization, Maximum Common Ordered (Induced) Subgraph (MCO(I)S), which seek to find subgraph isomorphisms that preserve the vertex orderings of two given ordered graphs. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We prove that these problems remain NP-complete even when restricted to small graph classes, such as trees of depth 2 and threshold graphs. (2) We establish a gap in computational complexity between OSI and OISI on certain graph classes. For instance, OSI is polynomial-time solvable for interval graphs with their interval orderings, whereas OISI remains NP-complete under the same setting. (3) We demonstrate that the tractability of these problems can depend on the vertex ordering. For example, while OISI is NP-complete on threshold graphs, its generalization, MCOIS, can be solved in polynomial time if the specific vertex orderings that characterize the threshold graphs are provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11739v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability, particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1) quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting, effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Globalization for Scalable Short-term Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11729v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem. These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages with 22 figures</p></details> |

Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.</p></details> |  |

They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 ICML Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics, Code available at: https://github.com/StevenDillmann/ml-xraytransients-mnras</p></details> |

IoT devices typically collect data from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of this data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is centralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased communication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective alternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the need to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and environmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different locations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns. Accurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is crucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather forecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction accuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how non-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized extreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance. (2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series data influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated several synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and trained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world datasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental results show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when dealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate detrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper to appear in the proceedings of IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDGE COMPUTING & COMMUNICATIONS EDGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Matrix Is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01966v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Text-Image Time Series Retrieval in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19043v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing research interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time series (i.e., the query time series), ITSR methods search and retrieve from large archives the image time series that have similar content to the query time series. Existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval problems, relying on an assumption that users always have access to a query image time series in the considered image modality. In operational scenarios, this assumption may not hold. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we introduce the task of cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR). In detail, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-ITSR method that enables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and vice versa. We focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e., bitemporal images). Our text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1) modality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images and text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific projection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared embedding space. To effectively model the temporal information in the bitemporal images, we exploit two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion (GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective operators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that leverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant bitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal image). The code of this work is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/cross-modal-text-tsir .</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrast All the Time: Learning Time Series Representation from Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15416v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for time series using contrastive learning has emerged as a critical technique for improving the performance of downstream tasks. To advance this effective approach, we introduce CaTT (\textit{Contrast All The Time}), a new approach to unsupervised contrastive learning for time series, which takes advantage of dynamics between temporally similar moments more efficiently and effectively than existing methods. CaTT departs from conventional time-series contrastive approaches that rely on data augmentations or selected views. Instead, it uses the full temporal dimension by contrasting all time steps in parallel. This is made possible by a scalable NT-pair formulation, which extends the classic N-pair loss across both batch and temporal dimensions, making the learning process end-to-end and more efficient. CaTT learns directly from the natural structure of temporal data, using repeated or adjacent time steps as implicit supervision, without the need for pair selection heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach produces superior embeddings which allow better performance in downstream tasks. Additionally, training is faster than other contrastive learning approaches, making it suitable for large-scale and real-world time series applications.

| **[Extropy Rate: Properties and Application in Feature Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11242v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extropy, a complementary dual of entropy, (proposed by Lad et al. \cite{lad2015extropy} in 2015) has attracted considerable interest from the research community. In this study, we focus on discrete random variables and define conditional extropy, establishing key properties of joint and conditional extropy such as bounds, uncertainty reduction due to additional information, and Lipschitz continuity. We further introduce the concept of extropy rate for a stochastic process of discrete random variables as a measure of the average uncertainty per random variable within the process. It is observed that for infinite stationary and ergodic stochastic processes, as well as for identically and independently distributed sequences, the extropy rate exhibits asymptotic equivalence. We explore the extropy rate for finite stochastic processes and numerically illustrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying information across various distributions, quantifying complexity in time series data, and characterizing chaotic dynamics in dynamical systems. The behaviour of estimated extropy rate is observed to be closely aligned with Simpson's diversity index. The real-life applicability of the extropy rate is presented through a novel feature selection method based on the fact that features with higher extropy rates contain greater inherent information. Using six publicly available datasets, we show the superiority of the proposed feature selection method over some other existing popular approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11178v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures, conference</p></details> |

In particular, models based on a recursive, autoregressive-type structure such as the well-known integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) models are very popular in practice. The distribution of such INAR models is fully determined by a vector of autoregressive binomial thinning coefficients and the discrete innovation distribution. While fully parametric estimation techniques for these models are mostly covered in the literature, a semi-parametric approach allows for consistent and efficient joint estimation of the model coefficients and the innovation distribution without imposing any parametric assumptions. Although the limiting distribution of this estimator is known, which, in principle, enables asymptotic inference and INAR model diagnostics on the innovations, it is cumbersome to apply in practice. In this paper, we consider a corresponding semi-parametric INAR bootstrap procedure and show its joint consistency for the estimation of the INAR coefficients and for the estimation of the innovation distribution. We discuss different application scenarios that include goodness-of-fit testing, predictive inference and joint dispersion index analysis for count time series. In simulations, we illustrate the finite sample performance of the semi-parametric INAR bootstrap using several innovation distributions and provide real-data applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 2 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |

With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods.

The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |
| **[Patch-wise Structural Loss for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00877v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has gained significant attention in machine learning due to its crucial role in various domains. However, most existing forecasting models rely heavily on point-wise loss functions like Mean Square Error, which treat each time step independently and neglect the structural dependencies inherent in time series data, making it challenging to capture complex temporal patterns accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Patch-wise Structural (PS) loss, designed to enhance structural alignment by comparing time series at the patch level. Through leveraging local statistical properties, such as correlation, variance, and mean, PS loss captures nuanced structural discrepancies overlooked by traditional point-wise losses. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with point-wise loss, simultaneously addressing local structural inconsistencies and individual time-step errors. PS loss establishes a novel benchmark for accurately modeling complex time series data and provides a new perspective on time series loss function design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PS loss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often struggle with limited temporal contexts, insufficient representation of normal patterns, and flawed evaluation metrics, all of which hinder their effectiveness in detecting anomalous behavior. To address these issues, we introduce a $\textbf{Sim}$ple dissimilarity-based approach for time series $\textbf{A}$nomaly $\textbf{D}$etection, referred to as $\textbf{SimAD}$. Specifically, SimAD first incorporates a patching-based feature extractor capable of processing extended temporal windows and employs the EmbedPatch encoder to fully integrate normal behavioral patterns. Second, we design an innovative ContrastFusion module in SimAD, which strengthens the robustness of anomaly detection by highlighting the distributional differences between normal and abnormal data. Third, we introduce two robust enhanced evaluation metrics, Unbiased Affiliation (UAff) and Normalized Affiliation (NAff), designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by providing better distinctiveness and semantic clarity. The reliability of these two metrics has been demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental analyses. Experiments conducted on seven diverse time series datasets clearly demonstrate SimAD's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative improvements of $\textbf{19.85%}$ on F1, $\textbf{4.44%}$ on Aff-F1, $\textbf{77.79%}$ on NAff-F1, and $\textbf{9.69%}$ on AUC on six multivariate datasets.

The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |

Aid detection is challenging for humans, especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes, such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so, we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HCII 2025</p></details> |

Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately. However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance. Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, published at KDD 2025 workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future</p></details> |

Despite numerous imputation techniques, a systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series, multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 3 algorithms, 2 tables</p></details> |

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs).

This paper introduces a neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Large Language Models with Temporal Transformers for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10098v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (32 with references and supplementary material).

GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix. Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Graph Structure via Adapted Flux Balance Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05806v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps, which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended and revised version of arXiv:2401.04280</p></details> |

Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathcal P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathcal Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv</p></details> |
| **[Bridging the Last Mile of Prediction: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Guided Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07192v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |

However, a cross-modality gap exists between time series and textual data, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. In this tutorial, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLM-based cross-modal time series analytics. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into three groups based on cross-modal modeling strategies, e.g., conversion, alignment, and fusion, and then discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. In addition, we summarize several open challenges. This tutorial aims to expand the practical application of LLMs in solving real-world problems in cross-modal time series analytics while balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Participants will gain a thorough understanding of current advancements, methodologies, and future research directions in cross-modal time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SSTD 2025 (Tutorial). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.02583</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Neural Networks and Dynamic Time Warping for Adaptive Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09826v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast, dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available, while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and remains competitive in rich-resource settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Time Series Autoregression for Periodicity Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22895v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series autoregression (AR) is a classical tool for modeling auto-correlations and periodic structures in real-world systems. We revisit this model from an interpretable machine learning perspective by introducing sparse autoregression (SAR), where $\ell_0$-norm constraints are used to isolate dominant periodicities. We formulate exact mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approaches for both stationary and non-stationary settings and introduce two scalable extensions: a decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy for temporally-varying SAR (TV-SAR), and a two-stage optimization scheme for spatially- and temporally-varying SAR (STV-SAR). These models enable scalable inference on real-world spatiotemporal datasets. We validate our framework on large-scale mobility and climate time series. On NYC ridesharing data, TV-SAR reveals interpretable daily and weekly cycles as well as long-term shifts due to COVID-19. On climate datasets, STV-SAR uncovers the evolving spatial structure of temperature and precipitation seasonality across four decades in North America and detects global sea surface temperature dynamics, including El Ni\~no. Together, our results demonstrate the interpretability, flexibility, and scalability of sparse autoregression for periodicity quantification in complex time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal Clinical Rationale Generation for Disease Diagnosis with Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07611v5)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.</p></details> | 13 pages. 7 figures |

Desalination processes are highly energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2 emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures, salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles. This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses. The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance scheduling, and regulate energy source switching. To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for scenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support system for climate-adaptive planning.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning enables large-scale mapping but depends on geo-referenced ground-truth data, which is costly to collect, motivating the use of global datasets in data-scarce regions. A key challenge is understanding how the quantity, quality, and proximity of the training data to the target region influences model performance. We evaluate this in Nigeria, using 1,827 manually labelled samples covering the whole country, and subsets of the Geowiki dataset: Nigeria-only, regional (Nigeria and neighbouring countries), and global. We extract pixel-wise multi-source time series arrays from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 climate, and a digital elevation model using Google Earth Engine, comparing Random Forests with LSTMs, including a lightweight multi-headed LSTM variant. Results show local data significantly boosts performance, with accuracy gains up to 0.246 (RF) and 0.178 (LSTM). Nigeria-only or regional data outperformed global data despite the lower amount of labels, with the exception of the multi-headed LSTM, which benefited from global data when local samples were absent. Sentinel-1, climate, and topographic data are critical data sources, with their removal reducing F1-score by up to 0.593. Addressing class imbalance also improved LSTM accuracy by up to 0.071. Our top-performing model (Nigeria-only LSTM) achieved an F1-score of 0.814 and accuracy of 0.842, matching the best global land cover product while offering stronger recall, critical for food security. We release code, data, maps, and an interactive web app to support future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is published in ISPRS Open Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing under a CC BY 4.0 license: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667393225000109.

| **[Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09445v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights, uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability across diverse application domains</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07290v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point detection in time series aims to identify moments when the probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas, such as human activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of multiple variables: If the distribution of any one variable changes, the entire time series undergoes a distribution shift. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions while accounting for the presence of other components. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this task by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods, and then employs conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution difference between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method allows a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025, Mai Khao, Thailand.

Detecting fraudulent transactions is critical for payment gateway companies like Flow Payment, which process millions of transactions monthly and require robust security measures to mitigate financial risks. Increasing transaction authorization rates while reducing fraud is essential for providing a good user experience and building a sustainable business. For this reason, discovering novel and improved methods to detect fraud requires continuous research and investment for any company that wants to succeed in this industry. In this work, we introduced a novel method for detecting transactional fraud by incorporating the Relative Distance Rotating Encoding (ReDRE) in the RoFormer model. The incorporation of angle rotation using ReDRE enhances the characterization of time series data within a Transformer, leading to improved fraud detection by better capturing temporal dependencies and event relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)</p></details> |

Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets, identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.</p></details> | 17pages |

In clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end, DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33% time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark.

Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression: Robust Forecasting for Noisy Chaotic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08738v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63 model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation frequency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p></details> | 56 pages, 21 figures |

This physical prior often takes the form of a partial differential equation (PDE) system that the regression function must satisfy. In the first part of this dissertation, we analyze the statistical properties of PIML methods. In particular, we study the properties of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in terms of approximation, consistency, overfitting, and convergence. We then show how PIML problems can be framed as kernel methods, making it possible to apply the tools of kernel ridge regression to better understand their behavior. In addition, we use this kernel formulation to develop novel physics-informed algorithms and implement them efficiently on GPUs. The second part explores industrial applications in forecasting energy signals during atypical periods. We present results from the Smarter Mobility challenge on electric vehicle charging occupancy and examine the impact of mobility on electricity demand. Finally, we introduce a physics-constrained framework for designing and enforcing constraints in time series, applying it to load forecasting and tourism forecasting in various countries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, Sorbonne University. 286 pages</p></details> |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

By replacing the fixed linear autoregressive component with a spline-based basis expansion, Galerkin-ARIMA flexibly approximates the underlying relationship among past values via ordinary least squares, while retaining the moving-average structure and Gaussian innovation assumptions of ARIMA. We derive closed-form solutions for both the AR and MA components using two-stage Galerkin projections, establish conditions for asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency, and analyze the bias-variance trade-off under basis-size growth. Complexity analysis reveals that, for moderate basis dimensions, our approach can substantially reduce computational cost compared to maximum-likelihood ARIMA estimation. Through extensive simulations on four synthetic processes-including noisy ARMA, seasonal, trend-AR, and nonlinear recursion series-we demonstrate that Galerkin-ARIMA matches or closely approximates ARIMA's forecasting accuracy while achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups in rolling forecasting tasks. These results suggest that Galerkin-ARIMA offers a powerful, efficient alternative for modeling complex time series dynamics in high-volume or real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing, and robotics. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures.

| **[A Bayesian framework for change-point detection with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01558v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel Bayesian method that can detect multiple structural breaks in the mean and variance of a length $T$ time-series. Our method quantifies uncertainty by returning $\alpha$-level credible sets around the estimated locations of the breaks. In the case of a single change in the mean and/or the variance of an independent sub-Gaussian sequence, we prove that our method attains a localization rate that is minimax optimal up to a $\log T$ factor. For an $\alpha$-mixing sequence with dependence, we prove this optimality holds up to $\log^2 T$ factor. For $d$-dimensional mean changes, we show that if $d \gg \log T$ and the mean signal is dense, then our method exactly recovers the location of the change. Our method detects multiple change-points by modularly ``stacking'' single change-point models and searching for a variational approximation to the posterior distribution. This approach is applicable to both continuous and count data. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and performance, and we produce credible sets that are an order of magnitude smaller than our competitors without sacrificing nominal coverage guarantees. We apply our method to real data by detecting i) the gating of an ion channel in the outer membrane of a bacterial cell, and ii) changes in the lithological structure of an oil well.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</p></details> | 46 pages, 9 figures |

Dynamic programming algorithms can solve this task exactly with at most quadratic time complexity. In recent years, the development of pruning strategies has drastically improved their computational efficiency. However, the two existing approaches have notable limitations: PELT struggles with pruning efficiency in sparse-change scenarios, while FPOP's structure is not adapted to multi-parametric settings. To address these issues, we introduce the DUal Simple Test (DUST) framework, which prunes candidate changes by evaluating a dual function against a threshold. This approach is highly flexible and broadly applicable to parametric models of any dimension. Under mild assumptions, we establish strong duality for the underlying non-convex pruning problem. We demonstrate DUST's effectiveness across various change-point regimes and models. In particular, for one-parametric models, DUST matches the simplicity of PELT with the efficiency of FPOP. Its use is especially advantageous for non-Gaussian models. Finally, we apply DUST to mouse monitoring time series under a change-in-variance model, illustrating its ability to recover the optimal change-point structure efficiently.</p></details> |  |

While recent Transformer models have improved forecasting capabilities, they come with high computational costs. Linear-based models have shown better accuracy than Transformers but still fall short of ideal performance. We propose PIAD-SRNN, a physics-informed adaptive decomposition state-space RNN, that separates seasonal and trend components and embeds domain equations in a recurrent framework. We evaluate PIAD-SRNN's performance on indoor air quality datasets, focusing on CO2 concentration prediction across various forecasting horizons, and results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms SoTA models in both long-term and short-term time series forecasting, including transformer-based architectures, in terms of both MSE and MAE. Besides proposing PIAD-SRNN which balances accuracy with efficiency, this paper also provides four curated datasets. Code and data: https://github.com/ahmad-shirazi/DSSRNN</p></details> |  |

After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures; Invited review for the Royal Society Philosophical Transactions A special issue "Symbolic regression in the physical sciences"</p></details> |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.</p></details> |  |

Then, we demonstrate that even with incomplete or noisy observations, Boolformer is still able to find good approximate expressions. We evaluate Boolformer on a broad set of real-world binary classification datasets, demonstrating its potential as an interpretable alternative to classic machine learning methods. Finally, we apply it to the widespread task of modeling the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and show through a benchmark that Boolformer is competitive with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude.

While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Given a discrete-time control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins. We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform (state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

Additionally, symbolic anchors such as photos or personalized content may serve as memory cues to reinforce digital engagement. This study explores how these mechanisms support technology use in dementia care within the South Korean context. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 11 professional caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with cognitive decline. Grounded theory methods guided the analysis, using iterative coding and constant comparison to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that familiar digital routines (e.g., taking photos) persisted through procedural memory. Symbolic anchors such as family photos or recognizable icons enhanced interaction and emotional engagement. However, unfamiliar or anthropomorphic technologies often triggered fear or symbolic resistance. DISCUSSION: Findings highlight the dual role of procedural memory and symbolic anchors in sustaining digital engagement. Designing culturally responsive and cognitively accessible technologies may enhance autonomy and well-being in dementia care.

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantial change to previous version (experiments, theorem, analysis and related work); currently under review at TMLR</p></details> |

The worst-case analysis (WCA) problem is an optimization-based abstraction of this task. Fuzzing and symbolic execution are widely used techniques for addressing the WCA problem. However, improving code coverage in fuzzing or managing path explosion in symbolic execution within the context of WCA poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose PathFuzzing, aiming to combine the strengths of both techniques to design a WCA method. The key idea is to transform a program into a symbolic one that takes an execution path (encoded as a binary string) and interprets the bits as branch decisions. PathFuzzing then applies evolutionary fuzzing techniques to the transformed program to search for binary strings that represent satisfiable path conditions and lead to high resource consumption. We evaluate the performance of PathFuzzing experimentally on a benchmark suite that consists of prior work's benchmarks and some added by us. Results show that PathFuzzing generally outperforms a fuzzing and a symbolic-execution baseline.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

How can we harness LLMs' broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures.

We present SymRAG, a framework that introduces adaptive query routing via real-time complexity and load assessment to select symbolic, neural, or hybrid pathways. SymRAG's neuro-symbolic approach adjusts computational pathways based on both query characteristics and system load, enabling efficient resource allocation across diverse query types. By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6--100.0% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6--6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985--3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169--1151%, showing its significance for complex models. These results suggest adaptive computation strategies are more sustainable and scalable for hybrid AI systems that use dynamic routing and neuro-symbolic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025)</p></details> |

However, these accelerators face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity, especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput, and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.

There has been a shift to ground models of language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal, distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science, and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics unified through words-as-classifiers.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In distributed AI systems, DSE plays a crucial role in identifying hard-to-detect bugs, especially those arising from complex network communication patterns. However, traditional approaches to symbolic execution are often hindered by scalability issues and inefficiencies, particularly in large-scale systems. This paper introduces LIFT (Large-language-model Integrated Functional-equivalent-IR Transformation), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the optimization of Intermediate Representations (IRs) in symbolic execution. LIFT addresses the challenges of symbolic execution by providing a scalable, context-sensitive solution for IR transformation. The framework consists of two phases: IR Analysis and Optimization, where LLMs optimize time-intensive IR blocks, and Symbolic Execution and Validation, which includes benchmarking and semantic verification to ensure correctness and generalizability. Experiments on real-world binaries demonstrated significant performance improvements, including a 53.5\% reduction in execution time for bigtest and a 10.24\% reduction for random, along with reductions in IR statements, PUT instructions, and temporary variables. These results demonstrate that LLMs simplify IRs while maintaining functional correctness, enhancing symbolic execution in distributed AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGCOMM 2025 - 2nd Workshop on Networks for AI Computing (NAIC). 7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |

To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> |

Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose DEcision Feedback IN-ContExt Detection (DEFINED) as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. We further establish an error lower bound and provide theoretical insights into the model's generalization under channel distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance to the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.07600</p></details> |
| **[Advancing network resilience theories with symbolized reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08827v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes. Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas. This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses. Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy, significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymMatika: Structure-Aware Symbolic Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03110v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.</p></details> |  |

Traditional mechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven approaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Automated Discovery of Kinetics (PI-ADoK) framework. By integrating physical constraints directly into a symbolic regression approach, PI-ADoK narrows the search space and substantially reduces the number of experiments required for model convergence. Additionally, the framework incorporates a robust uncertainty quantification strategy via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which propagates parameter uncertainty to yield credible prediction intervals. Benchmarking our method against conventional approaches across several catalytic case studies demonstrates that PI-ADoK not only enhances model fidelity but also lowers the experimental burden, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable kinetic model discovery in chemical reaction engineering.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

Our comprehensive experimental evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics questions, but they also generate distinctive reasoning patterns that emphasize on symbolic derivation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even for these highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy, highlighting the potential for continued performance gains.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of tensor equation.</p></details> |  |

By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Neuro-symbolic Systems (NeuS), 2025</p></details> |

How can we deliver such property to the current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content} features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to sentence generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoNLL...</summary><p>CoNLL2025 (Best Paper nomination)</p></details> |

The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.</p></details> |  |

Transformer models have shown promise in Symbolic Regression, but performance suffers with smaller datasets. We propose applying k-fold cross-validation to a transformer-based symbolic regression model trained on a significantly reduced dataset (15,000 data points, down from 500,000). This technique partitions the training data into multiple subsets (folds), iteratively training on some while validating on others. Our aim is to provide an estimate of model generalization and mitigate overfitting issues associated with smaller datasets. Results show that this process improves the model's output consistency and generalization by a relative improvement in validation loss of 53.31%.

In this work, we propose METEOR, a model for generating Melody-aware Texture-controllable re-Orchestration with a Transformer-based variational auto-encoder (VAE). This model performs symbolic instrumental and textural music style transfers with a focus on melodic fidelity and controllability. We allow bar- and track-level controllability of the accompaniment with various textural attributes while keeping a homophonic texture. With both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that our model outperforms style transfer models on a re-orchestration task in terms of generation quality and controllability. Moreover, it can be adapted for a lead sheet orchestration task as a zero-shot learning model, achieving performance comparable to a model specifically trained for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 34rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025) - AI, Arts and Creativity Special Track.

In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$.

However, the current practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight paper at Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025, Workshop on Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |
| **[RLSF: Fine-tuning LLMs via Symbolic Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16661v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models. We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals. Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> |  |

Each digit is represented as a symbolic triplet capturing its value, the parity of the next digit, and a local carry value, resulting in a state space of exactly 60 configurations. The transition rules are local, total, and parity-dependent, yet collectively reproduce the global behavior of the Collatz map through digitwise operations. All symbolic trajectories reduce to the unique terminal cycle (4, 0, 0) -> (2, 0, 0) -> (1, 0, 0), offering a constructive, automaton-theoretic encoding of the Collatz dynamics. A primitive recursive ranking function ensures symbolic termination within the proposed model and supports a convergence argument that is fully formalizable in Peano Arithmetic. This approach introduces a novel framework for analyzing arithmetic dynamics via symbolic computation and automata theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1.

| **[TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur, skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula) and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |

However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems. However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX), a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form expressions of complex dynamical systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PSALM-V: Automating Symbolic Planning in Interactive Visual Environments with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20097v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached. Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI, show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures from the robot.</p></details> |  |

Google Trends offers a rich proxy for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous ``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful groupings. We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.</p></details> | 33 pages, 30 figures |

It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up Unbiased Search-based Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19626v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is, expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data sets.</p></details> |  |

The model integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical mechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data. The neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning, or SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ctu-vras/fusionforce</p></details> |

Yet, automated solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimension Reduction for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19537v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger. Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables. However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Generating and Understanding Tests via Path-Aware Symbolic Execution with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and visualization of their path profiles.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior, achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

We establish that a sign-definite polynomial must satisfy specific algebraic constraints, which we leverage to develop a set of straightforward symbolic reduction rules. These rules can be recursively applied to symbolically simplify the Lyapunov candidate, enabling more efficient and robust discovery of Lyapunov functions via optimization or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In many cases, without such simplification, finding a valid Lyapunov function is often infeasible. When strict Lyapunov functions are unavailable, we design synthesis procedures for finding weak Lyapunov functions to verify global asymptotic stability using LaSalle's invariance principle. Finally, we encode instability conditions for Lyapunov functions and develop SMT procedures to disprove global asymptotic stability. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that the proposed symbolic reduction, LaSalle-type conditions, and instability tests allow us to efficiently solve many cases that would otherwise be challenging.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended version of a paper to be presented at QEST + FORMATS 2025</p></details> |

Composer-style music generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available, limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g., melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 6th Conference on AI Music Creativity, AIMC 2025</p></details> |

However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent. OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency. Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3% on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs) as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience. Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics and norms.</p></details> | 28 pages, 1 figure |

Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces a structured prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps: entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs' interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture. Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates, compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively.

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model across all tested datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |

This capacity is necessary, for instance, to distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like, content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding. Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent binding failures exhibited by these models.</p></details> |  |

Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a ``codebook'' of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or similar. We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices. The resulting clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\,\text{log}\,N)$, where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the codebook. Clean-up space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Furthermore, the codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in $\mathcal{O}(\text{log}\,N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. At the same time, asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Versatile Symbolic Music-for-Music Modeling via Function Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15548v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many music AI models learn a map between music content and human-defined labels. However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model (LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[RE-IMAGINE: Symbolic Benchmark Synthesis for Reasoning Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15455v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.</p></details> | version 3 |
| **[Enhancing Symbolic Machine Learning by Subsymbolic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14569v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of neuro-symbolic AI is to integrate symbolic and subsymbolic AI approaches, to overcome the limitations of either. Prominent systems include Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) or DeepProbLog, which offer neural predicates and end-to-end learning. The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score. The approach could be useful beyond this setting: Enhancing symbolic learners in this way could be extended to similarities between instances (effectively working like kernels within a logical language), for analogical reasoning, or for propositionalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (vision) language models as well as purely neural models show poor generalization to \emph{a-priori} unseen complex concepts. Neuro-symbolic methods (Grand et al., 2023) offer a promising alternative by searching in program space, but face challenges in large program spaces due to the inability to effectively guide the search using demonstrations. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as: (i) {\it Sketch:} detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) {\it Plan:} performing an MCTS search over grounded action sequences guided by human demonstrations (iii) {\it Generalize:} abstracting out grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular re-use, enabling continual concept learning. Our approach combines the benefits of code generation ability of large language models (LLMs) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures vis-\'a-vis LLM-only and purely neural approaches. Further, we demonstrate reasoning and planning capabilities with learned concepts for embodied instruction following.</p></details> | <details><summary>Progr...</summary><p>Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning Worskop, ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Verification Learning: Make Unsupervised Neuro-Symbolic System Feasible](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12917v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) Learning paradigm suffers from an over-reliance on labeled data, so if we completely disregard labels, it leads to less symbol information, a larger solution space, and more shortcuts-issues that current Nesy systems cannot resolve. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Verification Learning (VL), which addresses this challenge by transforming the label-based reasoning process in Nesy into a label-free verification process. VL achieves excellent learning results solely by relying on unlabeled data and a function that verifies whether the current predictions conform to the rules. We formalize this problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) and propose a Dynamic Combinatorial Sorting (DCS) algorithm that accelerates the solution by reducing verification attempts, effectively lowering computational costs and introduce a prior alignment method to address potential shortcuts. Our theoretical analysis points out which tasks in Nesy systems can be completed without labels and explains why rules can replace infinite labels for some tasks, while for others the rules have no effect. We validate the proposed framework through several fully unsupervised tasks including addition, sort, match, and chess, each showing significant performance and efficiency improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Symbolic Music from Natural Language Prompts using an LLM-Enhanced Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02084v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen many audio-domain text-to-music generation models that rely on large amounts of text-audio pairs for training. However, symbolic-domain controllable music generation has lagged behind partly due to the lack of a large-scale symbolic music dataset with extensive metadata and captions. In this work, we present MetaScore, a new dataset consisting of 963K musical scores paired with rich metadata, including free-form user-annotated tags, collected from an online music forum. To approach text-to-music generation, We employ a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate pseudo-natural language captions for music from its metadata tags. With the LLM-enhanced MetaScore, we train a text-conditioned music generation model that learns to generate symbolic music from the pseudo captions, allowing control of instruments, genre, composer, complexity and other free-form music descriptors. In addition, we train a tag-conditioned system that supports a predefined set of tags available in MetaScore. Our experimental results show that both the proposed text-to-music and tags-to-music models outperform a baseline text-to-music model in a listening test. While a concurrent work Text2MIDI also supports free-form text input, our models achieve comparable performance. Moreover, the text-to-music system offers a more natural interface than the tags-to-music model, as it allows users to provide free-form natural language prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Probabilistic Neuro-symbolic Layer for Algebraic Constraint Satisfaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19466v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as oral presentation at UAI 25</p></details> |
| **[Personalizable Long-Context Symbolic Music Infilling with MIDI-RWKV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13001v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations. However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/MIDI-RWKV.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Interpretable Deep Learning with LIES Networks for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08267v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires, computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies, fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the TISMIR</p></details> |

This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.</p></details> |  |

While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2024)</p></details> |

Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it, the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, 3 codes, oeis sequence A384735</p></details> |

Compared to existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational efficiency, and data quality.

To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty. Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Teaching LLM to Reason: Reinforcement Learning from Algorithmic Problems without Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07498v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct. The code, dataset, and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/LLaVA-CoT.</p></details> | 17 pages, ICCV 2025 |

However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes. We construct an affine calculus for $1$-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers. We illustrate the expressivity of the logic by a sequence of case studies: Proving upper limits on bisimilarity distances of Markov processes, showing convergence of a temporal learning algorithm and of a random walk using a coupling argument.

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \textit{outperform} previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on their reasoning capability. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09567v4)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT.

However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models - C32B, S32B, R32B - from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the current practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/JamyDon/Format-Beats-Descriptions.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.</p></details> |  |

While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02256v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies. Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization (UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of automated reward design compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically, we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Str...</summary><p>A Strong Baseline for Reasoning based Event Stream Scene Text Recognition</p></details> |

Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools.

| **[MedAgent-Pro: Towards Evidence-based Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis via Reasoning Agentic Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18968v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern medicine, clinical diagnosis relies on the comprehensive analysis of primarily textual and visual data, drawing on medical expertise to ensure systematic and rigorous reasoning. Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.</p></details> |  |

We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.

| **[Do LLMs Dream of Discrete Algorithms?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23408v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor, enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy, interpretable AI agents across complex domains.</p></details> |  |

Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2024</p></details> |

However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability, and directional conditional entropy. We analyze the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image. During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that, although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance on general vision tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> | 29 pages |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments.

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

Given a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task, SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and (iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally, logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14% less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics, we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by better representing them in their logical formulations.</p></details> |  |

However, current image tokenization methods demonstrate significant limitations in tasks requiring symbolic abstraction and logical reasoning capabilities essential for systematic inference. To address this challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{https://github.com/zhangpingrui/Adaptive-Text-Dreamer}{here}.</p></details> |  |
| **[DUMP: Automated Distribution-Level Curriculum Learning for RL-based LLM Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09710v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |

For instance, is their reasoning for a specific problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses. Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a foundation for a comprehensive benchmark framework to evaluate the performance of leading LLMs in executing spreadsheet functions, formula generation and data manipulation tasks. The benchmark encompasses tasks ranging from basic formula creation to complex, real world spreadsheet scenarios. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit proficiency in straightforward tasks, they often falter in complex, multi step operations, frequently producing plausible yet incorrect outputs. These results underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling spreadsheet tasks that require precise logical reasoning and highlight the need for integrating symbolic reasoning capabilities into LLM architectures. To support this, we introduce FLARE (Formula Logic, Auditing, Reasoning and Evaluation) a new benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on real-world spreadsheet logic, auditing, and reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 10 Tables, 1 Colour Figure</p></details> |

Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, supplementary material (appendix) included separately</p></details> |

However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.</p></details> |  |

As a comprehensive multimodal Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, AIGGC imposes substantial demands on language models, including factual accuracy, logical reasoning, expressive text generation, generation speed, and context management. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for AIGGC and present a comprehensive survey of 45 existing game commentary dataset and methods according to key challenges they aim to address in this domain. We further classify and compare various evaluation metrics commonly used in this domain.

Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion-R1: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Human Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10353v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in language models.

Recent advances in general vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning, consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines, showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and R1-like training paradigms.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Scaling up Intervention Models</p></details> |

However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.</p></details> |  |

To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p></details> |  |

Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability. Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution (ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.</p></details> |  |

We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383 reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate. These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language model reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of Small Language Models with Blueprints and Prompt Template Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08669v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>TTODL...</summary><p>TTODLer-FM Workshop@ICML'25 (Tiny Titans: The next wave of On-Device Learning for Foundational Models)</p></details> |

Integrating advanced modelling techniques with large language models (LLMs) and formal verification in a logical style can significantly enhance this process. We propose a comprehensive framework that focuses on specific Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams for preliminary system development. This framework offers visualisations at various modelling stages and seamlessly integrates large language models and logical reasoning engines. The behavioural models generated with the assistance of LLMs are automatically translated into formal logical specifications. Deductive formal verification ensures that logical requirements and interrelations between software artefacts are thoroughly addressed. Ultimately, the framework facilitates the automatic generation of program skeletons, streamlining the transition from design to implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDE) of the 33rd ACM Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE '25), June 23--27, 2025, Trondheim, Norway</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15817v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| **[Language-Vision Planner and Executor for Text-to-Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07778v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Collapse: How Language-Centric Foundation Models Shape Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05850v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates; (ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Enigmata: Scaling Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Synthetic Verifiable Puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19914v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at https://seed-enigmata.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[VProChart: Answering Chart Question through Visual Perception Alignment Agent and Programmatic Solution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01667v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charts are widely used for data visualization across various fields, including education, research, and business. Chart Question Answering (CQA) is an emerging task focused on the automatic interpretation and reasoning of data presented in charts. However, chart images are inherently difficult to interpret, and chart-related questions often involve complex logical and numerical reasoning, which hinders the performance of existing models. This paper introduces VProChart, a novel framework designed to address these challenges in CQA by integrating a lightweight Visual Perception Alignment Agent (VPAgent) and a Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach. VPAgent aligns and models chart elements based on principles of human visual perception, enhancing the understanding of chart context. The Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to transform natural language reasoning questions into structured solution programs, facilitating precise numerical and logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ChartQA and PlotQA demonstrate that VProChart significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its capability in understanding and reasoning with charts.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowCoder-V2: Deep Knowledge Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06881v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR}) framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability. Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline. Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner. To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes, transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover, when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Logical Reasoning in LLMs: A Fine-Grained Evaluation and Supervision Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04810v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition, to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Reasoning Potential of Pre-trained LLMs by Critique Fine-Tuning on One Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03295v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.</p></details> |  |

A vector-quantized symbol grounding mechanism and the corresponding disentanglement training method are introduced to enhance the controllability of logical symbols over generation. Furthermore, we propose two logical abduction methods to make our approach require few labeled training data and support the induction of latent logical generative rules from data. We experimentally show that our approach can be utilized to integrate various neural generative models with logical reasoning systems, by both learning from scratch or utilizing pre-trained models directly.

Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation metrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with 1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed across both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's reliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that most LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

| **[Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 (Survey Track)</p></details> |

However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Entailment Checking: Explore Eigenmarking Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03771v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic entailment is essential to reasoning, but entailment checking has the worst-case complexity of an exponential of the variable size. With recent development, quantum computing when mature may allow an effective approach for various combinatorial problems, including entailment checking. Grover algorithm uses Grover operations, selective phase inversion and amplitude amplification to address a search over unstructured data with quadratic improvement from a classical method. Its original form is intended to a single-winner scenario: exactly one match is promised. Its extension to multiple-winner cases employs probabilistic control over a number of applications of Grover operations, while a no-winner case is handled by time-out. Our study explores various schemes of ``eigenmarking'' approach. Still relying on Grover operations, but the approach introduces additional qubits to tag the eigenstates. The tagged eigenstates are to facilitate an interpretation of the measured results and enhance identification of a no-winner case (related to no logic violation in entailment context). Our investigation experiments three variations of eigenmarking on a two-qubit system using an IBM Aer simulator. The results show strong distinguishability in all schemes with the best relative distinguishabilities of 19 and 53 in worst case and in average case, respectively. Our findings reveal a viable quantum mechanism to differentiate a no-winner case from other scenarios, which could play a pivot role in entailment checking and logic reasoning in general.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Robustness of Prompting: Enhancing Robustness of Large Language Models Against Prompting Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03627v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance. Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> | 13pages |

While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15806v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

| **[Exposing Numeracy Gaps: A Benchmark to Evaluate Fundamental Numerical Abilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11075v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and semantic understanding. However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling.

Despite its significance, automating GPS remains challenging due to the dual demands of spatial understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. Recent advances in large models have enabled notable breakthroughs, particularly for SAT-level problems, yet the field remains fragmented across methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. This survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing, and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm, assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 4 figures, conference submission</p></details> |

Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial challenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored. We constructed and published two new textual entailment datasets NoFEVER-ML and NoSNLI-ML in four languages (English, Czech, German, and Ukrainian) with examples differing in negation. It allows investigation of the root causes of the negation problem and its exemplification: how popular LLM model properties and language impact their inability to handle negation correctly. Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size may improve the models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the models' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent and that the length and explicitness of the premise have an impact on robustness. There is better accuracy in projective language with fixed order, such as English, than in non-projective ones, such as German or Czech. Our entailment datasets pave the way to further research for explanation and exemplification of the negation problem, minimization of LLM hallucinations, and improvement of LLM reasoning in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate Signals from Format and Length: Reinforcement Learning for Solving Mathematical Problems without Ground Truth Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19439v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving, bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers. Our study shows that a reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases. Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain scenarios, achieving 40.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: the powerful base model is like an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.</p></details> |  |

While recent advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in logical reasoning and multi-task generalization, their applications in Re-ID tasks remain limited. They either struggle to perform accurate matching based on identity-relevant features or assist image-dominated branches as auxiliary semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ChatReID, that shifts the focus towards a text-side-dominated retrieval paradigm, enabling flexible and interactive re-identification. To integrate the reasoning abilities of language models into Re-ID pipelines, We first present a large-scale instruction dataset, which contains more than 8 million prompts to promote the model fine-tuning. Next. we introduce a hierarchical progressive tuning strategy, which endows Re-ID ability through three stages of tuning, i.e., from person attribute understanding to fine-grained image retrieval and to multi-modal task reasoning. Extensive experiments across ten popular benchmarks demonstrate that ChatReID outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all Re-ID tasks. More experiments demonstrate that ChatReID not only has the ability to recognize fine-grained details but also to integrate them into a coherent reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. We also observe a significant performance boost when LLMs are provided with external tools for oracle math and logic operations. These results highlight significant challenges and promising research directions in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.

However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[HEIE: MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable AIGC Image Implausibility Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17261v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details, and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable Image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.

| **[MDPO: Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15706v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step. Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps; Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset, outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not require manual annotation costs.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLM reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic visual logical reasoning training data. To tackle the challenge of image synthesis with grounding answers, we propose a rule-to-image synthesis pipeline, which extracts and expands puzzle rules from seed questions and generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://visualsphinx.github.io/</p></details> |

While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex. Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs, particularly via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality preference data, which is labor-intensive to annotate and crucial for reward model (RM) finetuning. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CodePMP, a scalable preference model pretraining (PMP) pipeline that utilizes a large corpus of synthesized code-preference pairs from publicly available high-quality source code. CodePMP improves RM finetuning efficiency by pretraining preference models on large-scale synthesized code-preference pairs. We evaluate CodePMP on mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and logical reasoning tasks (ReClor, LogiQA2.0), consistently showing significant improvements in reasoning performance of LLMs and highlighting the importance of scalable preference model pretraining for efficient reward modeling.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.14228 by other authors</p></details> |

Can LLMs Logically Reason Through Counterfactuals?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22318v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

However, education in this field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning.

To study this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning categories: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an robust evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and the LMM-as-a-judge approach. We conducted experiments evaluating nine prominent visual editing models, comprising both open-source and proprietary models. The evaluation results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in reasoning-based editing tasks. Even the most powerful model evaluated, GPT-4o-Image, achieves an accuracy of merely 28.8%. RISEBench effectively highlights the limitations of contemporary editing models, provides valuable insights, and indicates potential future directions for the field of reasoning-aware visual editing.

Despite the significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-Wise Formal Verification for LLM-Based Mathematical Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20869v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning improves reasoning quality but requires vast labeled data, while reward-maximizing reinforcement learning finds top-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ACL 2025 main</p></details> |

While studies have examined LLM capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
