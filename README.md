| **[Adam assisted Fully informed Particle Swarm Optimization ( Adam-FIPSO ) based Parameter Prediction for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06790v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent variational algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Max-Cut problem. A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15978v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), its hybrid quantum-classical solver (HA), as well as the third-generation Digital Annealer (DAv3) and Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO) developed by Fujitsu. The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 pseudo code, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off (using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Decomposition Strategies and Multi-shot ASP Solving for Job-shop Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07537v6)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Collab-Solver: Collaborative Solving Policy Learning for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03030v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00557v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+2 ...</summary><p>13+2 pages, 11+3 figures, accepted by Physical Review Research</p></details> |
| **[On Distributional Dependent Performance of Classical and Neural Routing Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02510v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and, more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed base node distribution.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Flow-Aware GNN for Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Substation Breaker Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01951v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGPO: Vision-augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization for the Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01774v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in the QAOA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087v6)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph is similarly limited in performance as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by the QAOA for even $q\ge 4$, Max-$q$-XORSAT is bounded away from optimality when optimised using asymptotic analysis due to the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Furthermore, the extension to logarithmic depth leads to a tightening of the upper bound that the QAOA outputs at logarithmic depth for MaxCUT and Max-$q$-XORSAT problems. We also provide some numerical evidence the limitation should be extended to odd $q$ by showing that the OGP exists for the Max-$3$-XORSAT on random regular graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, to be published in the journal of quantum information and computation</p></details> |
| **[Network Prebunking Problem: Optimizing Prebunking Targets to Suppress the Spread of Misinformation in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01124v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as prebunking has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the network prebunking problem, to identify optimal prebunking targets for minimizing the spread of misinformation in a social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose an approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binarizing Physics-Inspired GNNs for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13703v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

| **[Finding One Local Optimum Is Easy -- But What about Two?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07524v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class PLS (Polynomial Local Search) captures the complexity of finding a solution that is locally optimal and has proven to be an important concept in the theory of local search. It has been shown that local search versions of various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20632v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[An integer programming-based approach to construct exact two-sample binomial tests with maximum power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13689v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional hypothesis tests for differences between binomial proportions are at risk of being too liberal (Wald test) or overly conservative (Fisher's exact test). This problem is exacerbated in small samples. Regulators favour exact tests, which provide robust type I error control, even though they may have lower power than non-exact tests. To target an exact test with high power, we extend and evaluate an overlooked approach, proposed in 1969, which determines the rejection region through a binary decision for each outcome vector and uses integer programming to, in line with the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, find an optimal decision boundary that maximizes a power objective subject to type I error constraints. Despite only evaluating the type I error rate for a finite parameter set, our approach guarantees type I error control over the full parameter space. Our results show that the test maximizing average power exhibits remarkable robustness, often showing highest power among comparators while maintaining exact type I error control. The method can be further tailored to prior beliefs by using a weighted average. The findings highlight both the method's practical utility and how techniques from combinatorial optimization can improve statistical methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

While ONNs have been widely studied as Ising machines for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems, this work investigates their feasibility in solving linear algebra problems, specifically the inverse matrix. Grounded in thermodynamic principles, we analytically demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation has the highest accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22440v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to algorithm's stagnation.</p></details> |  |

While large-scale quantum computations are currently still out of reach, we can already numerically test such QUBO formulations on a perhaps surprisingly large scale. In this work, we benchmark Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, which captures the main complexity of the QUBO problem. We make a comprehensive benchmark against leading other heuristic algorithms on graphs with up to 53,000 variables by focusing on the wall-clock time. Moreover, we compare the DA performance against published performance results of the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical annealer and the recently proposed QIS3 heuristic. Based on performance statistics for over 2,000 graphs from the MQLib, we find that the DA yields competitive results. We hope that this benchmark demonstrates the extent to which large QUBO instances can be heuristically solved today, yielding consistent results across different solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 + ...</summary><p>24 + 14 pages, 12 figures.

| **[SLA-Centric Automated Algorithm Selection Framework for Cloud Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21963v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms. As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters, learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and SHAP-based interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, we present the Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Chromatic Number and Treewidth problems on, so-called, continuous or metric graphs where every edge is represented by a unit-length continuous interval rather than by a pair of vertices. If any point of any unit-interval edge is considered as a possible member of a hitting set or a cover, the classical combinatorial problems become trickier and many open questions arise. Notably, in many real-life applications, such a continuous view of a graph is more natural than the classic combinatorial definition of a graph. The contribution of this paper is twofold: i) we survey the known results for optimization problems on continuous graphs, and ii) we create a list of open problems related to the continuous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Memetic Algorithm for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21740v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs (CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process, significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Neural Combinatorial Optimization Solver for the Min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21386v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments.

Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers), when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a compelling and scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms applied to 3D spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT). We benchmark these methods against the performance of a leading quantum annealer on the same problem instances. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, in line with expectations from extreme value theory. We then show that APT, when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, exhibits a more favorable scaling and ultimately outperforms DT-SQA. We demonstrate these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware, projecting that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a new, rigorous classical baseline, clarifying the landscape for assessing a practical quantum advantage and presenting p-computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are openly available at https://github.com/OPUSLab/3DSpinGlassWithPbits.git</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalized Parameter Tuning in Coherent Ising Machines: A Portfolio-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20295v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have recently gained attention as a promising computing model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials, while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing the tuning process for CIMs.</p></details> |  |

We reduce this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max Average Cycle Weight* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>A not...</summary><p>A note presenting an open question</p></details> |

This paper investigates the case of class accuracy imbalance in LLMs, where deeply entangled pretraining biases and prompt-specific cues contribute to the imbalance. To overcome the difficulty in bias identification and inaccessibility of retraining, we post-hoc balance class accuracy using only output probabilities. This is enabled by reformulating debiasing as a combinatorial optimization problem. In details, we first motivate a post-hoc bias metric, the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), to quantify the over-/under-prediction (a tendency to over-predict some classes while under-predicting others) in LLMs. We then propose the Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) method to reweight LLM output class probabilities towards minimizing COBias and maximizing overall accuracy, without being constrained by bias sources or updating LLM parameters. Since the DNIP model contains non-differentiable elements, we use simulated annealing to efficiently solve it. Evaluations on five LLMs across NLP classification benchmarks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves significant COBias reduction (61% relative reduction) and accuracy improvement (18% relative increase) under different LLM prompting setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIS Codebook Index Assignment under Imperfect Control Links Using TSP-Inspired Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18727v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) promise transformative gains in wireless communications by enabling programmable control of the propagation environment through discrete phase configurations. In practical deployments, the control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks, with configuration indices transmitted over low latency, yet imperfect, wireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to significant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading system performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook index assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem, equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are "cities" and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion. A novel three-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this, consisting of a provision phase, a shotgun phase, and a fuzzy concatenation phase. Simulation results show that the method outperforms conventional indexing strategies and achieves near-optimal robustness to index errors, while also being scalable and hardwareagnostic for real time deployment. Future work includes multiple bits error correction and online adaptive mapping for time varying channels.</p></details> | RIS codebook |
| **[Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Collaborative Framework Integrating Large Language Model and Chemical Fragment Space: Mutual Inspiration for Lead Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13580v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Combinatorial Optimization with Graphical Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16031v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing work in online stochastic combinatorial optimization assumes that inputs are drawn from independent distributions -- a strong assumption that often fails in practice. At the other extreme, arbitrary correlations are equivalent to worst-case inputs via Yao's minimax principle, making good algorithms often impossible. This motivates the study of intermediate models that capture mild correlations while still permitting non-trivial algorithms. In this paper, we study online combinatorial optimization under Markov Random Fields (MRFs), a well-established graphical model for structured dependencies. MRFs parameterize correlation strength via the maximum weighted degree $\Delta$, smoothly interpolating between independence ($\Delta = 0$) and full correlation ($\Delta \to \infty$). While na\"ively this yields $e^{O(\Delta)}$-competitive algorithms and $\Omega(\Delta)$ hardness, we ask: when can we design tight $\Theta(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms? We present general techniques achieving $O(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms for both minimization and maximization problems under MRF-distributed inputs. For minimization problems with coverage constraints (e.g., Facility Location and Steiner Tree), we reduce to the well-studied $p$-sample model. For maximization problems (e.g., matchings and combinatorial auctions with XOS buyers), we extend the "balanced prices" framework for online allocation problems to MRFs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16004v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Design of Structured Variational Quantum Circuits with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16001v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v5)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown significant benefits in solving CO problems, reducing reliance on domain expertise and improving computational efficiency. However, the absence of a unified benchmarking framework leads to inconsistent evaluations, limits reproducibility, and increases engineering overhead, raising barriers to adoption for new researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce RL4CO, a unified and extensive benchmark with in-depth library coverage of 27 CO problem environments and 23 state-of-the-art baselines. Built on efficient software libraries and best practices in implementation, RL4CO features modularized implementation and flexible configurations of diverse environments, policy architectures, RL algorithms, and utilities with extensive documentation. RL4CO helps researchers build on existing successes while exploring and developing their own designs, facilitating the entire research process by decoupling science from heavy engineering. We finally provide extensive benchmark studies to inspire new insights and future work.

| **[A Large Language Model-Enhanced Q-learning for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06178v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.</p></details> |  |

We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |

The process that takes a real-world problem and extracts a clean mathematical abstraction of it often throws out a lot of "side information" which is deemed irrelevant. However, the discarded information could be of real significance to the end-user of the algorithm's output. All solutions of the same cost are not necessarily of equal impact in the real-world; some solutions may be much more desirable than others, even at the expense of additional increase in cost. If the impact, positive or negative, is mostly felt by some specific (minority) subgroups of the population, the population at large will be largely unaware of it. In this work we ask the question of finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems that are "unbiased" with respect to a collection of specified subgroups of the total population.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has focused attention on formulating combinatorial optimization problems as quadratic polynomials. To improve the performance of solving large QUBO problems, it is essential to minimize the number of binary variables used in the objective function. In this paper, we propose a QUBO formulation that offers a bit capacity advantage over conventional quadratization techniques. As a key application, this formulation significantly reduces the number of binary variables required for score-based Bayesian network structure learning. Experimental results on $16$ instances, ranging from $37$ to $223$ variables, demonstrate that our approach requires notably fewer binary variables than quadratization.

It has been demonstrated in the literature that such special-purpose solvers can outperform traditional CMOS architectures by orders of magnitude with respect to timing metrics on synthetic problems. However, they face challenges with constrained problems such as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), where mapping to binary formulations such as QUBO introduces overhead and limits parallelism. In-memory computing (IMC) devices, such as memristor-based analog Ising machines, offer significant speedups and efficiency gains over traditional CPU-based solvers, particularly for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we present a novel local search heuristic designed for IMC hardware to tackle the QAP. Our approach enables massive parallelism that allows for computing of full neighbourhoods simultaneously to make update decisions. We ensure binary solutions remain feasible by selecting local moves that lead to neighbouring feasible solutions, leveraging feasible-space search heuristics and the underlying structure of a given problem. Our approach is compatible with both digital computers and analog hardware. We demonstrate its effectiveness in CPU implementations by comparing it with state-of-the-art heuristics for solving the QAP.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p></details> |  |

The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums. We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes. To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds. Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, includes full algorithmic framework and empirical validation.

This study benchmarks five software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to 45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time. Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption. PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU. SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality, scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources permit.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Here we introduce quantum hypernetworks as a mechanism to train binary neural networks on quantum computers, which unify the search over parameters, hyperparameters, and architectures in a single optimization loop. Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits. We represent our quantum hypernetworks as variational quantum circuits, and find that an optimal circuit depth maximizes the probability of finding performant binary neural networks.

The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</p></details> |  |

The target is, for a given natural number $k < n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$.

Our main result is an $O(ds)$ pass algorithm with $O(s( \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)^{3d/s}) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d, \log (1/\varepsilon))$ space complexity in words, for any parameter $s \in [1, d \log (1/\varepsilon)]$, to solve $\varepsilon$-approximate LP-type problems of $O(d)$ combinatorial and VC dimension. Notably, by taking $s = d \log (1/\varepsilon)$, we achieve space complexity polynomial in $d$ and polylogarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$, presenting exponential improvements in $1/\varepsilon$ over current algorithms. We complement our results by showing lower bounds of $(1/\varepsilon)^{\Omega(d)}$ for any $1$-pass algorithm solving the $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation MEB and linear SVM problems, further motivating our multi-pass approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in APPROX 2025, 45 pages; Updated author information in v2</p></details> |
| **[Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator Can Solve Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization More Efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08053v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g., chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna, an open-source framework for HPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AutoML Conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |

We present a framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens. This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely classes.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted and accepted at the IEEE QSW 2025.

Traditional exact algorithms for such problems often rely on heuristic criteria to guide the exploration of feasible solutions. In this work, we propose using neural networks to learn informative heuristics-most notably, an optimality score that estimates a solution's proximity to the optimum. This score is used to evaluate nodes within a branch-and-bound framework, enabling a more efficient traversal of the solution space. Focusing on the Traveling Salesman Problem, we describe two exact solvers-1-tree branch-and-bound and Concorde-and introduce a hybrid approach called Graph Convolutional Branch and Bound, which augments these solvers with a graph convolutional neural network along with a novel unsupervised training strategy that facilitates generalization to graphs of varying sizes without requiring labeled data. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a significant reduction in the number of explored branch-and-bound nodes and overall computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to European Journal of Operational Research</p></details> |
| **[Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005v5)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dataless Neural Networks for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05322v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem, our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling, traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120) are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated version of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Combination generators with optimal cache utilization and communication free parallel execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03980v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an efficient and elegant combination generator for producing all combinations of size less than or equal to K, designed for exhaustive generation and combinatorial optimization tasks. This generator can be implemented to achieve what we define as optimal efficiency: constant amortized time, optimal cache utilization, embarrassingly parallel execution, and a recursive structure compatible with pruning-based search. These properties are difficult to satisfy simultaneously in existing generators. For example, classical Gray code or lexicographic generators are typically list-based and sequentially defined, making them difficult to vectorized, inefficient in cache usage, and inherently hard to parallelize. Generators based on unranking methods, while easy to parallelize, are non-recursive. These limitations reduce their applicability in our target applications, where both computational efficiency and recursion are crucial. We adapt Bird's algebra of programming-style calculation to derive our algorithms, a formalism for developing correct-by-construction programs from specifications. As a result, all generators in this paper are first formulated in their clearest specification, and efficient definitions are derived constructively through equational reasoning, resulting in concise and elegant divide-and-conquer definitions. Beyond presenting a combination generator, we extend our approach to construct generators for K-permutations, nested combinations of combinations, and nested permutation-combination structures. To the best of our knowledge, the literature has not previously reported generators for these nested structures. We also develop sequential variants that produce configurations in Gray code-compatible orders -- such as the revolving door ordering -- which are particularly useful for constructing nested generators.</p></details> |  |

We classify these studies into semantic categories and topics to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, including the tasks performed by LLMs, the architectures of LLMs, the existing datasets specifically designed for evaluating LLMs in CO, and the field of application. Finally, we identify future directions for leveraging LLMs in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Approximation Algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing with Fixed Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16534v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is one of the most extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization. Based on customer demand, we distinguish three variants of CVRP: unit-demand, splittable, and unsplittable. In this paper, we consider $k$-CVRP in general metrics and on general graphs, where $k$ is the vehicle capacity. All three versions are APX-hard for any fixed $k\geq3$. Assume that the approximation ratio of metric TSP is $\frac{3}{2}$. We present a $(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm for the splittable and unit-demand cases, and a $(\frac{5}{2}+\ln2-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm for the unsplittable case. Our approximation ratio is better than the previous results when $k$ is less than a sufficiently large value, approximately $1.7\times10^7$. For small values of $k$, we design independent and elegant algorithms with further improvements. For the splittable and unit-demand cases, we improve the approximation ratio from $1.792$ to $1.500$ for $k=3$, and from $1.750$ to $1.500$ for $k=4$. For the unsplittable case, we improve the approximation ratio from $1.792$ to $1.500$ for $k=3$, from $2.051$ to $1.750$ for $k=4$, and from $2.249$ to $2.157$ for $k=5$. The approximation ratio for $k=3$ surprisingly achieves the same value as in the splittable case. Our techniques, such as EX-ITP -- an extension of the classic ITP method, have the potential to improve algorithms for other routing problems as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in MFCS 2025</p></details> |

| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stein Gradient Descent Approach for Doubly Intractable Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21021v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference for doubly intractable distributions is challenging because they include intractable terms, which are functions of parameters of interest. Although several alternatives have been developed for such models, they are computationally intensive due to repeated auxiliary variable simulations. We propose a novel Monte Carlo Stein variational gradient descent (MC-SVGD) approach for inference for doubly intractable distributions. Through an efficient gradient approximation, our MC-SVGD approach rapidly transforms an arbitrary reference distribution to approximate the posterior distribution of interest, without necessitating any predefined variational distribution class for the posterior. Such a transport map is obtained by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence between the transformed and posterior distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We also investigate the convergence rate of the proposed method. We illustrate the application of the method to challenging examples, including a Potts model, an exponential random graph model, and a Conway--Maxwell--Poisson regression model. The proposed method achieves substantial computational gains over existing algorithms, while providing comparable inferential performance for the posterior distributions.</p></details> |  |

At present, deep learning time series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting. The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2) probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for time series prediction in the energy field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2025). 12 pages.

| **[Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases, including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests, QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based variational solvers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tail-Risk-Safe Monte Carlo Tree Search under PAC-Level Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05441v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions. We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter $\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the "worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set $\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret. Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk guarantees with improved rewards and stability.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, we consider the case where one has full field observations of a PDE solution, in case a one-dimensional diffusion equation, subject to a Gaussian observation error. Assuming one uses a particle-based Monte Carlo simulation when approximating the likelihood function, one gets an approximate likelihood with additive Gaussian noise in the log-likelihood. We study how these two Gaussian distributions affect the distribution of ratios of approximate likelihood evaluations, as required when evaluating acceptance probabilities in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We do so through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[AI Agent Smart Contract Exploit Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05558v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to billions in losses, yet finding actionable exploits remains challenging. Traditional fuzzers rely on rigid heuristics and struggle with complex attacks, while human auditors are thorough but slow and don't scale. Large Language Models offer a promising middle ground, combining human-like reasoning with machine speed. However, early studies show that simply prompting LLMs generates unverified vulnerability speculations with high false positive rates. To address this, we present A1, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 provides agents with six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, from understanding contract behavior to testing strategies on real blockchain states. All outputs are concretely validated through execution, ensuring only profitable proof-of-concept exploits are reported. We evaluate A1 across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. A1 achieves a 63% success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Across all successful cases, A1 extracts up to \$8.59 million per exploit and \$9.33 million total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we show that most exploits emerge within five iterations, with costs ranging \$0.01-\$3.59 per attempt. Using Monte Carlo analysis of historical attacks, we demonstrate that immediate vulnerability detection yields 86-89% success probability, dropping to 6-21% with week-long delays. Our economic analysis reveals a troubling asymmetry: attackers achieve profitability at \$6,000 exploit values while defenders require \$60,000 -- raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient-Boosted Pseudo-Weighting: Methods for Population Inference from Nonprobability samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00089v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonprobability samples have rapidly emerged to address time-sensitive priority topics in a variety of fields. While these data are timely, they are prone to selection bias. To mitigate selection bias, a large number of survey research literature has explored the use of propensity score (PS) adjustment methods to enhance population representativeness of nonprobability samples, using probability-based survey samples as external references. A recent advancement, the 2-step PS-based pseudo-weighting adjustment method (2PS, Li 2024), has been shown to improve upon recent developments with respect to mean squared error. However, the effectiveness of these methods in reducing bias critically depends on the ability of the underlying propensity model to accurately reflect the true selection process, which is challenging with parametric regression. In this study, we propose a set of pseudo-weight construction methods, which utilize gradient boosting methods (GBM) to estimate PSs in 2PS to construct pseudo-weights, offering greater flexibility compared to logistic regression-based methods. We compare the proposed GBM-based pseudo-weights with existing methods, including 2PS. The population mean estimators are evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation studies. We also evaluated prevalence of various health outcomes, including 15-year mortality, using 1988 ~ 1994 NHANES III as a nonprobability sample and the 1994 NHIS as the reference survey.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon in High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel sparse latent factor modeling framework using sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA) to analyze the co-movements of high-dimensional panel data over time. Unlike existing methods based on sparse PCA, which assume sparsity in the loading matrices, our approach posits sparsity in the factor processes while allowing non-sparse loadings. This is motivated by the fact that financial returns typically exhibit universal and non-sparse exposure to market factors. Unlike the commonly used $\ell_1$-relaxation in sparse PCA, the proposed sparse APCA employs a truncated power method to estimate the leading sparse factor and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases under $\ell_0$-constraints. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. We establish the consistency of our estimators under mild conditions as both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $T$ grow. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we apply our method to daily S&P 500 stock returns (2004--2016) and identify nine risk factors influencing the stock market.</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

| **[P-Aligner: Enabling Pre-Alignment of Language Models via Principled Instruction Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04626v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Value Based Parallel Update MCTS Method for Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision Making of Connected and Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13783v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.04295 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Design of Experiments in the Presence of Nuisance Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03948v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Design of experiments has traditionally relied on the frequentist hypothesis testing framework where the optimal size of the experiment is specified as the minimum sample size that guarantees a required level of power. Sample size determination may be performed analytically when the test statistic has a known asymptotic sampling distribution and, therefore, the power function is available in analytic form. Bayesian methods have gained popularity in all stages of discovery, namely, design, analysis and decision making. Bayesian decision procedures rely on posterior summaries whose sampling distributions are commonly estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. In the design of scientific studies, the Bayesian approach incorporates uncertainty about the design value(s) instead of conditioning on a single value of the model parameter(s). Accounting for uncertainties in the design value(s) is particularly critical when the model includes nuisance parameters. In this manuscript, we propose methodology that utilizes the large-sample properties of the posterior distribution together with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to efficiently obtain the optimal sample size and decision criteria in fixed and adaptive designs. We introduce a fully Bayesian procedure that incorporates the uncertainty associated with the model parameters including the nuisance parameters at the design stage. The proposed approach significantly reduces the computational burden associated with Bayesian design and enables the wide adoption of Bayesian operating characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic universal moment matching properties of normal distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03790v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moment matching is an easy-to-implement and usually effective method to reduce variance of Monte Carlo simulation estimates. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that moment matching will always reduce simulation variance for general integration problems at least asymptotically, i.e. when the number of samples is large. We study the characterization of conditions on a given underlying distribution $X$ under which asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed for a general integration problem $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ when moment matching techniques are applied. We show that a sufficient and necessary condition for such asymptotic variance reduction property is $X$ being a normal distribution. Moreover, when $X$ is a normal distribution, formulae for efficient estimation of simulation variance for (first and second order) moment matching Monte Carlo are obtained. These formulae allow estimations of simulation variance as by-products of the simulation process, in a way similar to variance estimations for plain Monte Carlo. Moreover, we propose non-linear moment matching schemes for any given continuous distribution such that asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed.</p></details> |  |

While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages (37 main), 6+6 figures, 1 table.

| **[Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereographic Multi-Try Metropolis Algorithms for Heavy-tailed Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12487v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from heavy-tailed distributions present unique challenges, particularly in high dimensions. Multi-proposal MCMC algorithms have recently gained attention for their potential to improve performance, especially through parallel implementation on modern hardware. This paper introduces a novel family of gradient-free MCMC algorithms that combine the multi-try Metropolis (MTM) with stereographic MCMC framework, specifically designed for efficient sampling from heavy-tailed targets. The proposed stereographic multi-try Metropolis (SMTM) algorithm not only outperforms traditional Euclidean MTM and existing stereographic random-walk Metropolis methods, but also avoids the pathological convergence behavior often observed in MTM and demonstrates strong robustness to tuning. These properties are supported by scaling analysis and extensive simulation studies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 8 figures |

Existing attack methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e., bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable (DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance than gradient-based competitors.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of 0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo framework to approximate deterministic, real-valued, bounded linear functionals that depend on the solution of a linear elliptic PDE with a lognormal diffusivity coefficient {parameterized by a 49-dimensional Gaussian random vector} and deterministic geometric singularities in bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We analyze the parametric regularity and develop the multilevel implementation based on a sequence of adaptive meshes, developed in "Goal-oriented adaptive finite element multilevel Monte Carlo with convergence rates", \emph{CMAME}, 402 (2022), p. 115582. For further variance reduction, we incorporate importance sampling and introduce a level-0 control variate within the multilevel hierarchy. {Introducing such control variate can alter the optimal choice of initial mesh, further highlighting the advantages of adaptive meshes.} Numerical experiments demonstrate that our adaptive QMC algorithm achieves a prescribed accuracy at substantially lower computational cost than the standard multilevel Monte Carlo method.</p></details> |  |

However, existing theory on VB primarily focuses on fixed-dimensional settings or specific models. To address this limitation, this paper develops a finite-sample theory for VB in a broad class of parametric models with latent variables. We establish theoretical properties of the VB posterior, including a non-asymptotic variational Bernstein--von Mises theorem. Furthermore, we derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the VB estimator. An application to multivariate Gaussian mixture models is presented for illustration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior Sampling of Probabilistic Word Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02337v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions. We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings. In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood, especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for posterior sampling of word embeddings.</p></details> |  |

However, most methods only classify dysfluencies at the utterance level. We introduce StutterCut, a semi-supervised framework that formulates dysfluency segmentation as a graph partitioning problem, where speech embeddings from overlapping windows are represented as graph nodes. We refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency boundaries for four dysfluency types. This provides a more realistic benchmark compared to synthetic datasets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that StutterCut outperforms existing methods, achieving higher F1 scores and more precise stuttering onset detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

We use the practical and popular geometric annealing schedule, and use a Langevin diffusion at each temperature level. The Langevin diffusion only needs to run for a time that is long enough to ensure local mixing within energy valleys, which is much shorter than the time required for global mixing. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the forth power of the inverse temperature, and the square of the inverse allowed error. We also study this algorithm in an illustrative model scenario where more explicit estimates can be given.</p></details> | 58 pages, 5 figures |

In this chapter, we review the various different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others, which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i) distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii) systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based inverse problem solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Smoothed Quantile Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01738v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian quantile regression based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) likelihood suffers from two fundamental limitations: the non-differentiability of the check loss precludes gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and the posterior mean provides biased quantile estimates. We propose Bayesian smoothed quantile regression (BSQR), which replaces the check loss with a kernel-smoothed version, creating a continuously differentiable likelihood. This smoothing has two crucial consequences: it enables efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, and it yields a consistent posterior distribution, thereby resolving the inferential bias of the standard approach. We further establish conditions for posterior propriety under various priors (including improper and hierarchical) and characterize how kernel choice affects posterior concentration and computational efficiency. Extensive simulations validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that BSQR achieves up to a 50% reduction in predictive check loss at extreme quantiles compared to ALD-based methods, while improving MCMC efficiency by 20-40% in effective sample size. An empirical application to financial risk measurement during the COVID-19 era illustrates BSQR's practical advantages in capturing dynamic systemic risk. The BSQR framework provides a theoretically-grounded and computationally-efficient solution to longstanding challenges in Bayesian quantile regression, with compact-support kernels like the uniform and triangular emerging as particularly effective choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms.

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches, Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over 1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.</p></details> |  |

While low-rank adaptation is a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, leading to instability in model performance on fine-tuning downstream tasks. This paper highlights the importance of effective parameterization in low-rank fine-tuning to reduce estimator variance and enhance the stability of final model outputs. We propose MonteCLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning technique that employs Monte Carlo estimation to learn an unbiased posterior estimation of low-rank parameters with low expected variance, stabilizing fine-tuned LLMs with only O(r) additional parameters, for a given rank r. MonteCLoRA shows 0.5% and 1.6% improvements in accuracy and robustness over unregularized low-rank adaptation method on natural language understanding tasks with pre-trained RoBERTa-base. Furthermore, in generative tasks with pre-trained LLaMA-1-7B and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, MonteCLoRA demonstrates robust performance with 50% and 62% lower spreads respectively than the contemporary efficient fine-tuning methods. The theoretical and empirical results presented in the paper underscore how parameterization and hyperpriors balance exploration-exploitation in the low-rank parametric space, therefore leading to more optimal and robust parameter estimation during efficient fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted in TMLR'25</p></details> |

These agents can play multiple board games of varying sizes using a single neural network with shared weights, thus overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed board sizes. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both a transformer encoder and a decoder. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses learnable embeddings as the decoder inputs. The additional decoder in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provides flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or on multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms, such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search. They approach the performance of AlphaZero despite relying on a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT performs strongly across all evaluated games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN with weights pre-trained on small board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, that of single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures for developing more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Segmentation Quality Prediction via Deep Learning Bayesian Modeling: Comprehensive Evaluation and Interpretation on Skin Cancer and Liver Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01460v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy, mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation, Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability, highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[NICE^k Metrics: Unified and Multidimensional Framework for Evaluating Deterministic Solar Forecasting Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01457v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate solar energy output prediction is key for integrating renewables into grids, maintaining stability, and improving energy management. However, standard error metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Skill Scores (SS) fail to capture the multidimensional nature of solar irradiance forecasting. These metrics lack sensitivity to forecastability, rely on arbitrary baselines (e.g., clear-sky models), and are poorly suited for operational use. To address this, we introduce the NICEk framework (Normalized Informed Comparison of Errors, with k = 1, 2, 3, Sigma), offering a robust and interpretable evaluation of forecasting models. Each NICEk score corresponds to an Lk norm: NICE1 targets average errors, NICE2 emphasizes large deviations, NICE3 highlights outliers, and NICESigma combines all. Using Monte Carlo simulations and data from 68 stations in the Spanish SIAR network, we evaluated methods including autoregressive models, extreme learning, and smart persistence. Theoretical and empirical results align when assumptions hold (e.g., R^2 ~ 1.0 for NICE2). Most importantly, NICESigma consistently shows higher discriminative power (p < 0.05), outperforming traditional metrics (p > 0.05). The NICEk metrics exhibit stronger statistical significance (e.g., p-values from 10^-6 to 0.004 across horizons) and greater generalizability. They offer a unified and operational alternative to standard error metrics in deterministic solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 1 Table, 5 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Quenched large deviations for Monte Carlo integration with Coulomb gases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01392v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure $\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure, so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$. Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the \emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to $\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of the approximation of the potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 7 figures.

The proposed algorithm can reduce the original stochastic system to the deterministic case and separate the randomness in the computation. Therefore, it can yield a significant improvement of efficiency and lead to less computational errors compared to the Monte Carlo method, since the statistics of the solution can be solved directly without repeating over many realizations. In particular, the proposed algorithm could inherit the multi-symplecticity. Numerical experiments are dedicated to performing the efficiency and accuracy of the Wiener chaos expansion algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[PageRank Centrality in Directed Graphs with Bounded In-Degree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01257v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the computational complexity of locally estimating a node's PageRank centrality in a directed graph $G$. For any node $t$, its PageRank centrality $\pi(t)$ is defined as the probability that a random walk in $G$, starting from a uniformly chosen node, terminates at $t$, where each step terminates with a constant probability $\alpha\in(0,1)$. To obtain a multiplicative $\big(1\pm O(1)\big)$-approximation of $\pi(t)$ with probability $\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is $O(n^{1/2}\min\{ \Delta_{in}^{1/2},\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}\})$ from [Wang, Wei, Wen, Yang STOC '24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and edges in $G$, and $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees and out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the previously best lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/2}\min\{\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},m^{1/4}\})$, where $\gamma=\frac{\log(1/(1-\alpha))}{4\log\Delta_{in}-2\log(1/(1-\alpha))}$ if $\Delta_{in}>1/(1-\alpha)$, and $\gamma=1/2$ if $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$. As $\gamma$ only depends on $\Delta_{in}$, the known upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$, and $\Delta_{out}$. However, there remains a gap of $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ when considering $\Delta_{in}$, and this gap is large when $\Delta_{in}$ is small. In the extreme case where $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$, we have $\gamma=1/2$, leading to a gap of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ between the bounds $O(n^{1/2})$ and $\Omega(1)$. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that achieves the above lower bound (up to logarithmic factors). The algorithm assumes that $n$ and the bounds $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ are known in advance. Our key technique is a novel randomized backwards propagation process which only propagates selectively based on Monte Carlo estimated PageRank scores.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Intensity Control: An Application to Choice-Based Network Revenue Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05358v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intensity control is a type of continuous-time dynamic optimization problems with many important applications in Operations Research including queueing and revenue management. In this study, we adapt the reinforcement learning framework to intensity control using choice-based network revenue management as a case study, which is a classical problem in revenue management that features a large state space, a large action space and a continuous time horizon. We show that by utilizing the inherent discretization of the sample paths created by the jump points, a unique and defining feature of intensity control, one does not need to discretize the time horizon in advance, which was believed to be necessary because most reinforcement learning algorithms are designed for discrete-time problems. As a result, the computation can be facilitated and the discretization error is significantly reduced. We lay the theoretical foundation for the Monte Carlo and temporal difference learning algorithms for policy evaluation and develop policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithms for intensity control. Via a comprehensive numerical study, we demonstrate the benefit of our approach versus other state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In the model, Ising spins are placed at network nodes/articles and the steady-state opinion polarization of spins is determined from the Monte Carlo iterations in which a given spin orientation is determined by in-going links from other spins. The main consideration is done for opinion confrontation between {\it capitalism, imperialism} (blue opinion) and {\it socialism, communism} (red opinion). These nodes have fixed spin/opinion orientation while other nodes achieve their steady-state opinions in the process of Monte Carlo iterations. We find that the global network opinion favors {\it socialism, communism} for all 6 editions. The model also determines the opinion preferences for world countries and political leaders, showing good agreement with heuristic expectations. We also present results for opinion competition between {\it Christianity} and {\it Islam}, and USA Democratic and Republican parties. We argue that the INOF approach can find numerous applications for directed complex networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 18 figures.

| **[Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 19 figures |

This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Machine Learning-Driven Multi-Fidelity Stratified Sampling for Failure Analysis of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00734v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamically Adaptive Reasoning via LLM-Guided MCTS for Efficient and Context-Aware KGQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Our novel online rolling controlled sequential Monte Carlo (ORCSMC) algorithm employs two particle systems to simultaneously estimate twisting functions and perform filtering, ensuring real-time adaptivity to new observations while maintaining bounded computational cost. Numerical results on linear-Gaussian, stochastic volatility, and neuroscience models demonstrate improved estimation accuracy and robustness in higher dimensions, compared to standard particle filtering approaches.

Inference for individual-based models is challenging due to the high-dimensional state-space of such models, which increases exponentially with population size. We consider sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for inference for individual-based epidemic models where we make direct observations of the state of a sample of individuals. Standard implementations, such as the bootstrap filter or the auxiliary particle filter are inefficient due to mismatch between the proposal distribution of the state and future observations. We develop new efficient proposal distributions that take account of future observations, leveraging the properties that (i) we can analytically calculate the optimal proposal distribution for a single individual given future observations and the future infection rate of that individual; and (ii) the dynamics of individuals are independent if we condition on their infection rates. Thus we construct estimates of the future infection rate for each individual, and then use an independent proposal for the state of each individual given this estimate. Empirical results show order of magnitude improvement in efficiency of the sequential Monte Carlo sampler for both SIS and SEIR models.</p></details> |  |

Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |

We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The software and case studies are available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>feedb...</summary><p>feedback welcome, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |

This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |

A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Constrained Sampling from Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12558v2)** | 2022-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained language models generate fluent text but are notoriously hard to controllably sample from. In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01581v4)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS4Net: Two-Stage Sample Selective Strategy for Rotating Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03116v1)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |

How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |

This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

Conditional generators are one of the successful implementations of such models wherein the created samples are constrained to a specific class. In this work, the application of these networks is extended to regression problems wherein the conditional generator is restrained to any continuous aspect of the data. A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

This is the case e.g. with strictly positive data and with compositional data, like percentages and the like. If the natural measure of difference is not the absolute one, it is possible to use simple algebraic properties to show that it is more convenient to work with a geometry that is not the usual Euclidean geometry in real space, and with a measure which is not the usual Lebesgue measure, leading to alternative models which better fit the phenomenon under study. The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

First, the high annotation cost of medical data leads to overfitting in models trained on label-limited, single-center datasets. To address this, we propose incorporating external data from related tasks and leveraging AE-GAN to extract prior knowledge, providing valuable references for downstream tasks. Second, many existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized medical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on manually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs. However, these approaches are complex, lack generalizability, and fail to adaptively capture disease-specific features across different conditions. To overcome this, we introduce LMCF (Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework), a framework that integrates a multi-head attention mechanism and adaptively learns representations from different views through inter-view and intra-view contrastive learning strategies. Additionally, the pre-trained AE-GAN is used to reconstruct discrepancies in the target data as disease probabilities, which are then integrated into the contrastive learning process. Experiments on three target datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other seven baselines, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare applications such as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. We release the source code at xxxxx.</p></details> | 10 pages |

At present, deep learning time series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting. The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2) probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for time series prediction in the energy field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2025). 12 pages.

Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs) can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Graph Topology Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01567v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. While recent advances have enabled graph topology learning from observed signals, existing methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. To address this gap, we introduce AdaCGP, a sparsity-aware adaptive algorithm for dynamic graph topology estimation from multivariate time series. AdaCGP estimates the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance, and bias. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that AdaCGP consistently outperforms multiple baselines across diverse graph topologies, achieving improvements exceeding 83% in GSO estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining favourable computational scaling properties. Our variable splitting approach enables reliable identification of causal connections with near-zero false alarm rates and minimal missed edges. Applied to cardiac fibrillation recordings, AdaCGP tracks dynamic changes in propagation patterns more effectively than established methods like Granger causality, capturing temporal variations in graph topology that static approaches miss. The algorithm successfully identifies stability characteristics in conduction patterns that may maintain arrhythmias, demonstrating potential for clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment of complex biomedical systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2 =0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE 5th International Conference on Advanced Algorithms and Neural Networks (AANN)</p></details> |

Creep deformation assessment is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data. Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a 15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models, effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.</p></details> |  |

Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 Pa...</summary><p>37 Pages, 19 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Physical Scales Matter: The Role of Receptive Fields and Advection in Satellite-Based Thunderstorm Nowcasting with Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09994v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of nowcasting development is transitioning from physically motivated advection methods to purely data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long forecast times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired forecast time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on forecast time and advection speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h forecast time. We confirm that, generally, advection becomes gradually more important with longer forecast times and higher advection speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML-based forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables.

Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 Figures, submitted to Quantum Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes are available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon in High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel sparse latent factor modeling framework using sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA) to analyze the co-movements of high-dimensional panel data over time. Unlike existing methods based on sparse PCA, which assume sparsity in the loading matrices, our approach posits sparsity in the factor processes while allowing non-sparse loadings. This is motivated by the fact that financial returns typically exhibit universal and non-sparse exposure to market factors. Unlike the commonly used $\ell_1$-relaxation in sparse PCA, the proposed sparse APCA employs a truncated power method to estimate the leading sparse factor and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases under $\ell_0$-constraints. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. We establish the consistency of our estimators under mild conditions as both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $T$ grow. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we apply our method to daily S&P 500 stock returns (2004--2016) and identify nine risk factors influencing the stock market.</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

Using circuit analysis techniques, we show that a large class of transistor amplifiers can be modeled as Linear Dynamic Influence Model (LDIM), where the interactions between different amplifier stages are modeled as linear dynamic equations. LDIM modeling of transistor circuits leads to application of data-driven network reconstruction techniques to characterize stage interactions and identify faults and critical circuit parameters efficiently. Employing graphical modeling techniques and Wiener filtering, we demonstrate that the network structure can be reconstructed solely from voltage time-series measurements sampled at specified points in the circuit. The efficacy of these network reconstruction methods in multistage amplifiers is demonstrated through extensive simulations involving multiple amplifier circuits in Cadence, as well as experimental results on physical hardware. The ability to infer network structure directly from measurement data offers designers and users efficient tools to design, analyze, and debug amplifier circuits. To demonstrate the utility of network reconstruction in multistage amplifier circuits, a fault diagnosis method leveraging these techniques is presented.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model Chronos significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. We also noticed that the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures, and discussed the possible reasons. We hope our study and findings will inspire the community to explore the applicability of large time series models in hydrological applications.

| **[Retrieval-Augmented Water Level Forecasting for Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04888v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models, have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in ecosystem management. The code and data are available at https://github.com/rahuul2992000/WaterRAF.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

We propose a process modeling framework enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks. We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CaPulse: Detecting Anomalies by Tuning in to the Causal Rhythms of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04630v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges, i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework, CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04488v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Field data were collected from 31 asphalt pavement sections located across four climatic zones in Texas. The data encompasses a variety of surface types, milling depths, operational speeds, and drum configurations. A standardized data collection protocol was followed, with measurements taken before milling, immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Skid number and Mean Profile Depth (MPD) were used to evaluate surface friction and texture characteristics. The dataset was reformatted into a time-series structure with 930 observations, including contextual variables such as climatic zone, treatment parameters, and baseline surface condition. A comparative modeling framework was applied to predict the deterioration trends of both skid resistance and macrotexture over time. Eight regression models, including linear, tree-based, and ensemble methods, were evaluated alongside a time series transformer model. Results show that the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy for skid resistance (R2 = 0.981), while Random Forest performing best for macrotexture prediction (R2 = 0.838). The findings indicate that the degradation of surface characteristics after preventive maintenance is nonlinear and influenced by a combination of environmental and operational factors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven modeling in supporting transportation agencies with pavement performance forecasting and maintenance planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTS++: Cross-Modal Time Series Foundation Model with Continual Pre-trained Visual Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04379v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12 probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission under review</p></details> |

This paper proposes a binaural sound event localization and detection (BiSELD) neural network to address these challenges. BiSELDnet learns time-frequency patterns and head-related transfer function (HRTF) localization cues from binaural input features. A novel eight-channel binaural time-frequency feature (BTFF) is introduced, comprising left/right mel-spectrograms, V-maps, an interaural time difference (ITD) map (below 1.5 kHz), an interaural level difference (ILD) map (above 5 kHz with front-back asymmetry), and spectral cue (SC) maps (above 5 kHz for elevation). The effectiveness of BTFF was confirmed across omnidirectional, horizontal, and median planes. BiSELDnets, particularly one based on the efficient Trinity module, were implemented to output time series of direction vectors for each sound event class, enabling simultaneous detection and localization. Vector activation map (VAM) visualization was proposed to analyze network learning, confirming BiSELDnet's focus on the N1 notch frequency for elevation estimation. Comparative evaluations under urban background noise conditions demonstrated that the proposed BiSELD model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SELD models with binaural input.</p></details> | 200 pages |
| **[T3Time: Tri-Modal Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Multi-Head Alignment and Residual Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04251v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches, where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98% on average.

Existing methods for multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework. PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy. While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data, existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.</p></details> |  |

While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadTime: An Effective Backdoor Attack on Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04189v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (MLTSF) models are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as climate, finance, and transportation. Although a variety of powerful MLTSF models have been proposed to improve predictive performance, the robustness of MLTSF models against malicious backdoor attacks remains entirely unexplored, which is crucial to ensuring their reliable and trustworthy deployment. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study on backdoor attacks against MLTSF models and propose the first effective attack method named BadTime. BadTime executes a backdoor attack by poisoning training data and customizing the backdoor training process. During data poisoning, BadTime proposes a contrast-guided strategy to select the most suitable training samples for poisoning, then employs a graph attention network to identify influential variables for trigger injection. Subsequently, BadTime further localizes optimal positions for trigger injection based on lag analysis and proposes a puzzle-like trigger structure that distributes the trigger across multiple poisoned variables to jointly steer the prediction of the target variable. During backdoor training, BadTime alternately optimizes the model and triggers via proposed tailored optimization objectives. Extensive experiments show that BadTime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on time series forecasting by reducing MAE by over 50% on target variables and boosting stealthiness by more than 3 times.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance as a simple yet effective architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.03751 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20968v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that govern domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists of three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 scenarios and ranking first across all benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks.

Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025</p></details> |

The SSI data constitute a matrix with spectrally (rows) and temporally (columns) resolved solar energy flux measurements. The most recent SSI measurements have been made by NASA's Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) since March 2018. This data have considerable missing data due to both random factors and instrument downtime, a periodic trend related to the Sun's cyclical magnetic activity, and varying degrees of correlation among the spectra, some approaching unity. We propose a novel low-rank matrix factorization method that uses autoregressive regularization and periodic spline detrending to recover the missingness. The method is a two-step procedure, each of which tackles scattered and downtime missingness, respectively. We design efficient alternating algorithms to jointly estimate the model parameters. Moreover, we build a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method using conformal prediction. We validate the prediction interval coverage rates and assess the imputation accuracy against competing models such as Gaussian process regression and linear time series smoothing via numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04048v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al. [\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth.</p></details> |  |

This paper rethink the development of TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture, FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54 baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under decentralization.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, scaling FL to time series foundation models</p></details> |

However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Dynamic Dimension Reduction with Deep Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03546v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted SICE FES 2025</p></details> |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in PMLR 298, 10th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC)</p></details> |

The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03989v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPADE-S: A Sparsity-Robust Foundational Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21155v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods. SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster (in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points selected and labelled.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering group dynamics in coordinated time series via hierarchical recurrent switching-state models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14973v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek a computationally efficient model for a collection of time series arising from multiple interacting entities (a.k.a. "agents"). Recent models of temporal patterns across individuals fail to incorporate explicit system-level collective behavior that can influence the trajectories of individual entities. To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources. Further experiments on soldier data as well as a synthetic task with 64 cooperating entities show how our approach can yield interpretable insights about team dynamics over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |

Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art (SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score. However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs, translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  |

We propose a nonparametric data segmentation methodology for multivariate time series termed NP-MOJO. By considering joint characteristic functions between the time series and its lagged values, NP-MOJO is able to detect change points in the marginal distribution, but also those in possibly non-linear serial dependence, all without the need to pre-specify the type of changes. We show the theoretical consistency of NP-MOJO in estimating the total number and the locations of the change points, and demonstrate the good performance of NP-MOJO against a variety of change point scenarios. We further demonstrate its usefulness in applications to seismology and economic time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging ocean wave physics and deep learning: Physics-informed neural operators for nonlinear wavefield reconstruction in real-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03315v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions, thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and prediction in realistic marine environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03251v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference of Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

This inflexible approach can generate excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%.

| **[Efficient Time Series Processing for Transformers and State-Space Models through Token Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17951v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing long token sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |

The core innovation of our approach lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse, physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Independent Automatic Generation of Descriptive Texts for Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16647v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to scarcity of time-series data annotated with descriptive texts, training a model to generate descriptive texts for time-series data is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.</p></details> |  |

Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and dynamical settings.</p></details> |  |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  |

The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time series specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICML 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[HGTS-Former: Hierarchical HyperGraph Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02411v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation technique for the proposed method. We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its performance against other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02198v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional financial time series often exhibit complex dependence relations driven by both common market structures and latent connections among assets. To capture these characteristics, this paper proposes Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (FNIRVAR), a model for the common and idiosyncratic components of high-dimensional time series with an underlying unobserved network structure. The common component is modelled by a static factor model, which allows for strong cross-sectional dependence, whilst a network vector autoregressive process captures the residual co-movements due to the idiosyncratic component. An assortative stochastic block model underlies the network VAR, leading to groups of highly co-moving variables in the idiosyncratic component. For estimation, a two-step procedure is proposed, whereby the static factors are estimated via principal component analysis, followed by estimation of the network VAR parameters. The method is demonstrated in financial applications to daily returns, intraday returns, and FRED-MD macroeconomic variables. In all cases, the proposed method outperforms a static factor model, as well as a static factor plus LASSO-estimated sparse VAR model, in terms of forecasting and financial performance metrics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SpikeSTAG: Spatial-Temporal Forecasting via GNN-SNN Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02069v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[IFD: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Insider Filing Violation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20162v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider trading violations, particularly delayed disclosures of Form 4 filings, remain a persistent challenge for financial market surveillance. Despite regulatory requirements such as the two-business-day rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcement is limited by the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets and task-specific benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the Insider Filing Delay (IFD) dataset, the first and largest publicly available resource for insider disclosure behavior, comprising over one million Form 4 transactions spanning two decades (2002 to 2025), with structured annotations on delay status, insider roles, governance factors, and firm-level financial indicators. IFD enables the first large-scale formulation of strategic disclosure violation detection as a binary classification task grounded in regulatory compliance. To demonstrate the utility of IFD, we propose MaBoost, a hybrid framework combining a Mamba-based state space encoder with XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in identifying high-risk behavioral patterns. Experiments across statistical baselines, deep learning models, and large language models confirm that MaBoost outperforms prior approaches, achieving an F1 score of up to 99.47 percent under constrained regulatory settings. IFD provides a realistic, reproducible, and behavior-rich dataset for developing AI models in financial compliance, regulatory forensics, and interpretable time series classification.

While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limit the models' representational capacities. Moreover, existing deep learning-based methods are not sufficiently lightweight. Addressing these issues, we present PatchAD, our novel, highly efficient multiscale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that utilizes contrastive learning for representation extraction and anomaly detection. With its four distinct MLP Mixers and innovative dual project constraint module, PatchAD mitigates potential model degradation and offers a lightweight solution, requiring only $0.403M$ parameters. Its efficacy is demonstrated by state-of-the-art results across $8$ datasets sourced from different application scenarios, outperforming over $30$ comparative algorithms. PatchAD significantly improves the classical F1 score by 6.84%, the Aff-F1 score by 4.27%, and the V-ROC by 2.49%. Simultaneously, an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying PatchAD has been conducted from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, validating the design motivations of the model.

| **[Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01971v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.</p></details> | Under review |

While functional connectivity captures statistical associations, it does not reveal directionality or causal mechanisms. We introduce CITS (Causal Inference in Time Series), a non-parametric method for inferring statistically causal neural circuitry from high-resolution time series data. CITS models neural dynamics using a structural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged conditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics. Unlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models and Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and no temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially non-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures. We prove consistency under mild mixing assumptions and validate CITS on simulated linear, nonlinear, and continuous-time recurrent neural network data, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We then apply CITS to Neuropixels recordings from mouse brain during visual tasks. CITS uncovers interpretable, stimulus-specific causal circuits linking cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions, consistent with experimental literature. It also reveals that neurons with similar orientation selectivity indices are more likely to be causally connected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CITS in uncovering biologically meaningful pathways and generating hypotheses for future experimental studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.09604</p></details> |

The age distribution of deaths is an example of constrained data, which are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. A centered log-ratio transformation and a cumulative distribution function transformation are used to remove the two constraints, where the latter transformation can also handle the presence of zero counts. Our general procedure divides data samples into training, validation, and testing sets. Within the validation set, we can select an optimal tuning parameter by calibrating the empirical coverage probabilities to be close to their nominal ones. With the selected optimal tuning parameter, we then construct the pointwise prediction intervals using the same models for the holdout data in the testing set. Using Japanese age- and sex-specific life-table death counts, we assess and evaluate the interval forecast accuracy with a suite of functional time-series models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work (1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain. \textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the \emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the \emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably, \textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy development.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series through Mutual Information Featurization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01848v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics. This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for uncovering causal structures in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Predictive Control to Coordinate Discrete- and Continuous-Time Models for Time-Series Analysis with Control-Theoretical Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01833v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis, such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation, extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and (2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics. During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, submitted to ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |

In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency for consecutive time steps. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Generated Text is Non-Stationary: Detection via Temporal Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01754v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.</p></details> |  |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different financial analysis tasks designed by domain experts, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Accepted by MM 2025 |
| **[A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning for Any Atlas and Disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01727v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MHARFedLLM: Multimodal Human Activity Recognition Using Federated Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01701v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras, limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance, achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of 0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and robust HAR systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs. The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Visual Plans from Unlabeled Videos via Symbolic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08444v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual planning, by offering a sequence of intermediate visual subgoals to a goal-conditioned low-level policy, achieves promising performance on long-horizon manipulation tasks. To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Inputs for Grammar Mining using Dynamic Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03832v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process structured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid, this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First, the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature. Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01', `10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8469 etc.). Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression, which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information processing.</p></details> | 4 figures, 3 tables |

However, current metasurface-based transmitters architecture fundamentally suffer from hardware non-modularization, forcing all transmitter functions onto nonlinear switch-based unit cells, which introduces symbol mapping inconsistency via phase coupling. Moreover, both temporal coding (limited by unit cell diodes) and space-time coding (impaired by symbol anisotropy) exhibit irreducible harmonic interference and entangled control of amplitude, phase, and beam direction. This paper proposes a metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA), comprising a digital up-conversion (DUC) module performing baseband-to-intermediate frequency (IF) conversion, filtering, and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and a reconfigurable metasurface featuring programmable unit cells that independently control both the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient. Systematically, the architecture leverages a dual-stage up-conversion process, typical of superheterodyne systems, but uniquely employs the metasurface for the final RF conversion stage. Building upon this framework, a proof-of-concept prototype featuring a 5.8 GHz magnitude-phase decoupled (MPD) metasurface (<15 degree phase deviation per state) and a DAC-based DUC module is presented. Extensive validation confirms the metasurface's capability for distortion-free mixing with arbitrary IF signals while maintaining consistent radiation patterns. The prototype successfully implements diverse QAM modulation schemes (4QAM to 256QAM) in mono-static and bi-static configurations, demonstrating symbol isotropy for spatially separated receivers and achieving a data rate of approximately 20 Mbps (at 5 MHz IF)...</p></details> |  |
| **[CloudAnoAgent: Anomaly Detection for Cloud Sites via LLM Agent with Neuro-Symbolic Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01844v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Finite-State Symbolic Automaton Model for the Collatz Map and Its Convergence Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21728v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a finite-state, deterministic automaton that emulates the Collatz function through digitwise transitions on base-10 representations. Each digit is represented as a symbolic triplet (r, p, c) encoding its value, the parity of the next digit, and an incoming carry propagated from the lower digit. This yields exactly 60 possible local states. The automaton applies local, parity-aware rules that collectively reconstruct the global arithmetic of the Collatz map. We show that all symbolic trajectories converge in finitely many steps to a unique terminal cycle (4, 0, 0) -> (2, 0, 0) -> (1, 0, 0), with all higher digit positions degenerating to the absorbing state (0, 0, 0). This collapse reveals a canonical symbolic normal form of Collatz dynamics. In parallel, a binary view explains the dynamics as alternating bit-length growth and contraction, aligning with known heuristics for Collatz convergence. This structural perspective is further reinforced by a symbolic drift function and a ranking potential that together explain and formalize the convergence process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Updated automaton diagrams, outlining support for affine maps T(n) = an + b, and a new section on binary symbolic drift explaining convergence.

| **[A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.</p></details> | version 3 |
| **[Via Score to Performance: Efficient Human-Controllable Long Song Generation with Bar-Level Symbolic Notation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01394v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC; nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation. Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its superiority across multiple subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.</p></details> |  |

While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability.

This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desyan: A Platform for Seamless Value-Flow and Symbolic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00508v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, two different types of static analyses have emerged as dominant paradigms both in academia and industry: value-flow analysis (e.g., data-flow analysis or points-to analysis) and symbolic analysis (e.g., symbolic execution). Despite their individual successes in numerous application fields, the two approaches have remained largely separate; an artifact of the simple reality that there is no broadly adopted unifying platform for effortless and efficient integration of symbolic techniques with high-performance data-flow reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce Desyan: a platform for writing program analyses with seamless integration of value-flow and symbolic reasoning. Desyan expands a production-ready Datalog fixpoint engine (Souffl\'e) with full-fledged SMT solving invoking industry-leading SMT engines. Desyan provides constructs for automatically (and efficiently!) handling typical patterns that come up in program analysis. At the same time, the integration is agnostic with respect to the solving technology, and supports Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, via a bottom-up algebraic reasoning module. The result is an engine that allows blending different kinds of reasoning, as needed for the underlying analysis. For value-flow analysis, the engine is the best-in-class Datalog evaluator (often by a factor of over 20x in execution time); for applications that require full SMT (e.g., a concolic execution engine or other symbolic evaluator that needs to solve arbitrarily complex conditions), the engine is leveraging the leading SMT solvers; for lightweight symbolic evaluation (e.g., solving simple conditionals in the context of a path-sensitive analysis), the engine can use Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, achieving large speedups (often of over 2x) compared to eagerly appealing to an SMT solver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching the Teacher: Improving Neural Network Distillability for Symbolic Regression via Jacobian Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22767v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However, this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the ``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.</p></details> |  |

We built a neural-symbolic system, called FGeo-HyperGNet, to automatically perform human-like geometric problem solving. The symbolic component is a formal system built on FormalGeo, which can automatically perform geometric relational reasoning and algebraic calculations and organize the solution into a hypergraph with conditions as hypernodes and theorems as hyperedges. The neural component, called HyperGNet, is a hypergraph neural network based on the attention mechanism, including an encoder to encode the structural and semantic information of the hypergraph and a theorem predictor to provide guidance in solving problems. The neural component predicts theorems according to the hypergraph, and the symbolic component applies theorems and updates the hypergraph, thus forming a predict-apply cycle to ultimately achieve readable and traceable automatic solving of geometric problems. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural-symbolic architecture. We achieved state-of-the-art results with a TPA of 93.50% and a PSSR of 88.36% on the FormalGeo7K dataset.

Lately LLM agents for software engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used SonarQube static analyzer. Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment, agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as Agentless to improve their output.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Probabilistic Reasoning on Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21873v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

These theories could serve as a building block to specify cryptographic primitive implementations and automatically discover attacks as binary circuits in the symbolic model. We provide proofs of equivalence between this class of equational theories and Boolean logic up to circuit size 3 and we provide the variant complexities and performance benchmarks using Maude-NPA. This is the first result in this direction and follow-up research is needed to improve the scalability of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable Approach to Probabilistic Neuro-Symbolic Robustness Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03274v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy AI) has emerged as a promising direction for integrating neural learning with symbolic reasoning. Typically, in the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete. In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p></details> | long paper |
| **[DEM-NeRF: A Neuro-Symbolic Method for Scientific Discovery through Physics-Informed Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21350v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular, neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences, without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods, boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Neural Networks: Symbolic Reasoning over Wavelet Logic Graph Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21190v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients. Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled, interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures for learning on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Symbolic Music Generation with Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20128v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved symbolic music generation. However, most approaches rely on transformer-based architectures with self-attention mechanisms, which are constrained by quadratic computational complexity, limiting scalability for long sequences. To address this, we propose Symbolic Music Diffusion with Mamba (SMDIM), a novel diffusion-based architecture integrating Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient global context modeling and the Mamba-FeedForward-Attention Block (MFA) for precise local detail preservation. The MFA Block combines the linear complexity of Mamba layers, the non-linear refinement of FeedForward layers, and the fine-grained precision of self-attention mechanisms, achieving a balance between scalability and musical expressiveness. SMDIM achieves near-linear complexity, making it highly efficient for long-sequence tasks. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including FolkDB, a collection of traditional Chinese folk music that represents an underexplored domain in symbolic music generation, SMDIM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Beyond symbolic music, SMDIM's architectural design demonstrates adaptability to a broad range of long-sequence generation tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for coherent sequence modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages,3figures |

The key insight is to leverage an LLM to automatically generate vulnerability patterns and translate them into detection queries. Specifically, MoCQ incorporates an iterative loop in which an LLM refines queries based on carefully designed feedback information. The resulting queries are then executed to analyze large codebases and detect vulnerabilities. We evaluated MoCQ on 12 vulnerability types across four programming languages. MoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-developed queries, with significantly less expert time needed. MoCQ also uncovered 46 new vulnerability patterns that experts missed, each representing an overlooked vulnerability class. MoCQ further discovered seven previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself. We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router, a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 31 figures.

| **[Agentic Program Repair from Test Failures at Scale: A Neuro-symbolic approach with static analysis and test execution feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18755v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale across diverse software offerings internally. Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes. Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator, the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness (neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of 42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations. Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated fixes). Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good starting point.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17482v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space. Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as "black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems, requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible, adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise, interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |

| **[Fast Task Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15975v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few "important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.</p></details> |  |

However, its nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.</p></details> |  |

It aims to enable users to drive generative software development using only natural language requirements. However, since end-users often lack knowledge of software engineering, their requirement descriptions are frequently ambiguous, raising significant challenges to generative software development. Although existing approaches utilize structured languages like Gherkin to clarify user narratives, they still struggle to express the causal logic between preconditions and behavior actions. This paper introduces RequireCEG, a requirement elicitation and self-review agent that embeds causal-effect graphs (CEGs) in a neuro-symbolic collaboration architecture. RequireCEG first uses a feature tree to analyze user narratives hierarchically, clearly defining the scope of software components and their system behavior requirements. Next, it constructs the self-healing CEGs based on the elicited requirements, capturing the causal relationships between atomic preconditions and behavioral actions. Finally, the constructed CEGs are used to review and optimize Gherkin scenarios, ensuring consistency between the generated Gherkin requirements and the system behavior requirements elicited from user narratives. To evaluate our method, we created the RGPair benchmark dataset and conducted extensive experiments. It achieves an 87% coverage rate and raises diversity by 51.88%.</p></details> |  |

Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.</p></details> |  |

However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards.

| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boolformer: Symbolic Regression of Logic Functions with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12207v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Boolformer, a Transformer-based model trained to perform end-to-end symbolic regression of Boolean functions. First, we show that it can predict compact formulas for complex functions not seen during training, given their full truth table. Then, we demonstrate that even with incomplete or noisy observations, Boolformer is still able to find good approximate expressions. We evaluate Boolformer on a broad set of real-world binary classification datasets, demonstrating its potential as an interpretable alternative to classic machine learning methods. Finally, we apply it to the widespread task of modeling the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and show through a benchmark that Boolformer is competitive with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude. Our code and models are available publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with new ESPRESSO experiments, reworked manuscript.

| **[Neural Network-Guided Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Descriptor Discovery in Perovskite Catalysts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12404v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Given a discrete-time control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins. We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform (state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

Additionally, symbolic anchors such as photos or personalized content may serve as memory cues to reinforce digital engagement. This study explores how these mechanisms support technology use in dementia care within the South Korean context. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 11 professional caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with cognitive decline. Grounded theory methods guided the analysis, using iterative coding and constant comparison to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that familiar digital routines (e.g., taking photos) persisted through procedural memory. Symbolic anchors such as family photos or recognizable icons enhanced interaction and emotional engagement. However, unfamiliar or anthropomorphic technologies often triggered fear or symbolic resistance. DISCUSSION: Findings highlight the dual role of procedural memory and symbolic anchors in sustaining digital engagement. Designing culturally responsive and cognitively accessible technologies may enhance autonomy and well-being in dementia care. Keywords: procedural memory, symbolic anchors, dementia care, digital engagement, older adults, cultural adaptation, caregiving technologies</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 page, 2 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantial change to previous version (experiments, theorem, analysis and related work); currently under review at TMLR</p></details> |
| **[PathFuzzing: Worst Case Analysis by Fuzzing Symbolic-Execution Paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09892v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating worst-case resource consumption is a critical task in software development. The worst-case analysis (WCA) problem is an optimization-based abstraction of this task. Fuzzing and symbolic execution are widely used techniques for addressing the WCA problem. However, improving code coverage in fuzzing or managing path explosion in symbolic execution within the context of WCA poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose PathFuzzing, aiming to combine the strengths of both techniques to design a WCA method. The key idea is to transform a program into a symbolic one that takes an execution path (encoded as a binary string) and interprets the bits as branch decisions. PathFuzzing then applies evolutionary fuzzing techniques to the transformed program to search for binary strings that represent satisfiable path conditions and lead to high resource consumption. We evaluate the performance of PathFuzzing experimentally on a benchmark suite that consists of prior work's benchmarks and some added by us. Results show that PathFuzzing generally outperforms a fuzzing and a symbolic-execution baseline.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Numerous classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as paper in 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning,NeSy 2025</p></details> |

However, manual annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We present SymRAG, a framework that introduces adaptive query routing via real-time complexity and load assessment to select symbolic, neural, or hybrid pathways. SymRAG's neuro-symbolic approach adjusts computational pathways based on both query characteristics and system load, enabling efficient resource allocation across diverse query types. By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6--100.0% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6--6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985--3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169--1151%, showing its significance for complex models. These results suggest adaptive computation strategies are more sustainable and scalable for hybrid AI systems that use dynamic routing and neuro-symbolic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ML-Based Automata Simplification for Symbolic Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08751v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity, especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput, and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.

There has been a shift to ground models of language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal, distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science, and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics unified through words-as-classifiers.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In distributed AI systems, DSE plays a crucial role in identifying hard-to-detect bugs, especially those arising from complex network communication patterns. However, traditional approaches to symbolic execution are often hindered by scalability issues and inefficiencies, particularly in large-scale systems. This paper introduces LIFT (Large-language-model Integrated Functional-equivalent-IR Transformation), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the optimization of Intermediate Representations (IRs) in symbolic execution. LIFT addresses the challenges of symbolic execution by providing a scalable, context-sensitive solution for IR transformation. The framework consists of two phases: IR Analysis and Optimization, where LLMs optimize time-intensive IR blocks, and Symbolic Execution and Validation, which includes benchmarking and semantic verification to ensure correctness and generalizability. Experiments on real-world binaries demonstrated significant performance improvements, including a 53.5\% reduction in execution time for bigtest and a 10.24\% reduction for random, along with reductions in IR statements, PUT instructions, and temporary variables. These results demonstrate that LLMs simplify IRs while maintaining functional correctness, enhancing symbolic execution in distributed AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGCOMM 2025 - 2nd Workshop on Networks for AI Computing (NAIC). 7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |

To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> |

Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose DEcision Feedback IN-ContExt Detection (DEFINED) as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. We further establish an error lower bound and provide theoretical insights into the model's generalization under channel distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance to the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.07600</p></details> |
| **[Advancing network resilience theories with symbolized reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08827v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes. Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas. This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses. Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy, significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.</p></details> |  |

Traditional mechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven approaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Automated Discovery of Kinetics (PI-ADoK) framework. By integrating physical constraints directly into a symbolic regression approach, PI-ADoK narrows the search space and substantially reduces the number of experiments required for model convergence. Additionally, the framework incorporates a robust uncertainty quantification strategy via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which propagates parameter uncertainty to yield credible prediction intervals. Benchmarking our method against conventional approaches across several catalytic case studies demonstrates that PI-ADoK not only enhances model fidelity but also lowers the experimental burden, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable kinetic model discovery in chemical reaction engineering.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

However, most existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models.

By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Neuro-symbolic Systems (NeuS), 2025</p></details> |

How can we deliver such property to the current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content} features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to sentence generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoNLL...</summary><p>CoNLL2025 (Best Paper nomination)</p></details> |

The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.</p></details> |  |

After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.</p></details> | ISMIR (2025) |

Transformer models have shown promise in Symbolic Regression, but performance suffers with smaller datasets. We propose applying k-fold cross-validation to a transformer-based symbolic regression model trained on a significantly reduced dataset (15,000 data points, down from 500,000). This technique partitions the training data into multiple subsets (folds), iteratively training on some while validating on others. Our aim is to provide an estimate of model generalization and mitigate overfitting issues associated with smaller datasets. Results show that this process improves the model's output consistency and generalization by a relative improvement in validation loss of 53.31%. Potentially enabling more efficient and accessible symbolic regression in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

By altering the original instrumentation, the orchestrator often modifies the musical texture while preserving a recognizable melodic line and ensures that each part is playable within the technical and expressive capabilities of the chosen instruments. In this work, we propose METEOR, a model for generating Melody-aware Texture-controllable re-Orchestration with a Transformer-based variational auto-encoder (VAE). This model performs symbolic instrumental and textural music style transfers with a focus on melodic fidelity and controllability. We allow bar- and track-level controllability of the accompaniment with various textural attributes while keeping a homophonic texture. With both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that our model outperforms style transfer models on a re-orchestration task in terms of generation quality and controllability. Moreover, it can be adapted for a lead sheet orchestration task as a zero-shot learning model, achieving performance comparable to a model specifically trained for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 34rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025) - AI, Arts and Creativity Special Track.

In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 10th International Workshop on Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation</p></details> |

However, the current practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight paper at Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025, Workshop on Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |
| **[RLSF: Fine-tuning LLMs via Symbolic Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16661v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models. We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals. Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur, skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula) and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |

However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

| **[Method-Based Reasoning for Large Language Models: Extraction, Reuse, and Continuous Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04289v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of language tasks. However, their reasoning process is primarily guided by statistical patterns in training data, which limits their ability to handle novel problems and perform consistent logical reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method-based model that enhances LLMs with explicit, reusable procedures extracted from training content, generated responses, and user interactions. Each method is represented as a pair consisting of a problem and its corresponding solution, stored externally and ranked based on feedback. When a new query is received, the system retrieves and applies the most relevant methods to guide the LLM's response. Our model enables continual learning, method reuse, and logical consistency beyond next-token prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the system improves factual verification and generalization in complex prompts, and that newly learned methods can outperform earlier ones through user-driven refinement.</p></details> |  |

These models have diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine, and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately enhancing the programming experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Recommendation with Simulated Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14147v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in explainable recommendation have greatly bolstered user experience by elucidating the decision-making rationale. However, the existing methods actually fail to provide effective feedback signals for potentially better or worse generated explanations due to their reliance on traditional supervised learning paradigms in sparse interaction data. To address these issues, we propose a novel human-like feedback-driven optimization framework. This framework employs a dynamic interactive optimization mechanism for achieving human-centered explainable requirements without incurring high labor costs. Specifically, we propose to utilize large language models (LLMs) as human simulators to predict human-like feedback for guiding the learning process. To enable the LLMs to deeply understand the task essence and meet user's diverse personalized requirements, we introduce a human-induced customized reward scoring method, which helps stimulate the language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, considering the potential conflicts between different perspectives of explanation quality, we introduce a principled Pareto optimization that transforms the multi-perspective quality enhancement task into a multi-objective optimization problem for improving explanation performance. At last, to achieve efficient model training, we design an off-policy optimization pipeline. By incorporating a replay buffer and addressing the data distribution biases, we can effectively improve data utilization and enhance model generality. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15787v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04339v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Generic-to-Specific Reasoning and Learning for Scalable Ad Hoc Teamwork](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04163v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field.

| **[A Comparative Study of Neurosymbolic AI Approaches to Interpretable Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03366v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeSy 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23541v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop Invariant Generation: A Hybrid Framework of Reasoning optimised LLMs and SMT Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00419v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100% coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133, while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be generalizable to other imperative languages.</p></details> | Under Review |

To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

| **[Socrates or Smartypants: Testing Logic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models with Logic Programming-based Test Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12312v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset, model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, work in progress</p></details> |

However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

| **[LLM4VV: Evaluating Cutting-Edge LLMs for Generation and Evaluation of Directive-Based Parallel Programming Model Compiler Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet. Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[On the Limits of Hierarchically Embedded Logic in Classical Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness. This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination, repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in future development of language models.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning through Visual and Textual Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.</p></details> |  |

Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences. Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes, for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation. Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts, including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters, and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices, integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes. Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA)</p></details> |

However, challenges persist within theorem proving, such as the identification of key mathematical concepts, understanding their interrelationships, and formalizing proofs correctly within natural language. We present KG-prover, a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs mined from reputable mathematical texts to augment general-purpose LLMs to construct and formalize mathematical proofs. We also study the effects of scaling graph-based, test-time compute using KG-Prover, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines across multiple datasets. General-purpose LLMs improve up to 21\% on miniF2F-test when combined with KG-Prover, with consistent improvements ranging from 2-11\% on the ProofNet, miniF2F-test, and MUSTARD datasets without additional scaling. Furthermore, KG-Prover with o4-mini achieves over 50% miniF2F-test. This work provides a promising approach for augmenting natural language proof reasoning with knowledge graphs without the need for additional finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML AI4Math Workshop 2025, NAACL SRW 2025</p></details> |

Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks: ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and \emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively.

However, this training paradigm cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining. Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can One Domain Help Others? A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 24 figures |
| **[MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17476v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 (Survey Track)</p></details> |

A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks.

To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty. Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning.

However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes. We construct an affine calculus for $1$-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers. We illustrate the expressivity of the logic by a sequence of case studies: Proving upper limits on bisimilarity distances of Markov processes, showing convergence of a temporal learning algorithm and of a random walk using a coupling argument. Finally we show how to encode a probabilistic Hoare logic in our logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages plus 30 pages proof appendix.

We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \textit{outperform} previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on their reasoning capability. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models - C32B, S32B, R32B - from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the current practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/JamyDon/Format-Beats-Descriptions.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.</p></details> |  |

While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02256v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies. Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization (UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of automated reward design compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically, we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Str...</summary><p>A Strong Baseline for Reasoning based Event Stream Scene Text Recognition</p></details> |

Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.</p></details> |  |

We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.

However, their reliance on probabilistic inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor, enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy, interpretable AI agents across complex domains.</p></details> |  |

Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2024</p></details> |

However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability, and directional conditional entropy. We analyze the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image. During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that, although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance on general vision tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> | 29 pages |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities.

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

Recent methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14% less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics, we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by better representing them in their logical formulations.</p></details> |  |

However, current image tokenization methods demonstrate significant limitations in tasks requiring symbolic abstraction and logical reasoning capabilities essential for systematic inference. To address this challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{https://github.com/zhangpingrui/Adaptive-Text-Dreamer}{here}.</p></details> |  |
| **[DUMP: Automated Distribution-Level Curriculum Learning for RL-based LLM Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09710v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

| **[Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15551v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |

For instance, is their reasoning for a specific problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses. Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a foundation for a comprehensive benchmark framework to evaluate the performance of leading LLMs in executing spreadsheet functions, formula generation and data manipulation tasks. The benchmark encompasses tasks ranging from basic formula creation to complex, real world spreadsheet scenarios. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit proficiency in straightforward tasks, they often falter in complex, multi step operations, frequently producing plausible yet incorrect outputs. These results underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling spreadsheet tasks that require precise logical reasoning and highlight the need for integrating symbolic reasoning capabilities into LLM architectures. To support this, we introduce FLARE (Formula Logic, Auditing, Reasoning and Evaluation) a new benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on real-world spreadsheet logic, auditing, and reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 10 Tables, 1 Colour Figure</p></details> |

Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, supplementary material (appendix) included separately</p></details> |
| **[ProtoReasoning: Prototypes as the Foundation for Generalizable Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15211v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.</p></details> |  |

As a comprehensive multimodal Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, AIGGC imposes substantial demands on language models, including factual accuracy, logical reasoning, expressive text generation, generation speed, and context management. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for AIGGC and present a comprehensive survey of 45 existing game commentary dataset and methods according to key challenges they aim to address in this domain. We further classify and compare various evaluation metrics commonly used in this domain. To support future research and benchmarking, we also provide a structured datasheet summarizing the essential attributes of these datasets in appendix, which is meanwhile publicly available in an open repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners: Modular Reasoning with Brain-Like Specialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13331v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval. Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Breaking Thought Patterns: A Multi-Dimensional Reasoning Framework for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13192v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses. To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion-R1: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Human Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10353v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in language models.

Recent advances in general vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning, consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines, showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and R1-like training paradigms.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Scaling up Intervention Models</p></details> |

However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code, data, and model can be found at this repository: https://github.com/JHU-CLSP/Rationalyst</p></details> |

Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.</p></details> |  |

The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Spurious Correlations in LLMs via Causality-Aware Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09433v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability. Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution (ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11128v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383 reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate. These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language model reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of Small Language Models with Blueprints and Prompt Template Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08669v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>TTODL...</summary><p>TTODLer-FM Workshop@ICML'25 (Tiny Titans: The next wave of On-Device Learning for Foundational Models)</p></details> |

Integrating advanced modelling techniques with large language models (LLMs) and formal verification in a logical style can significantly enhance this process. We propose a comprehensive framework that focuses on specific Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams for preliminary system development. This framework offers visualisations at various modelling stages and seamlessly integrates large language models and logical reasoning engines. The behavioural models generated with the assistance of LLMs are automatically translated into formal logical specifications. Deductive formal verification ensures that logical requirements and interrelations between software artefacts are thoroughly addressed. Ultimately, the framework facilitates the automatic generation of program skeletons, streamlining the transition from design to implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDE) of the 33rd ACM Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE '25), June 23--27, 2025, Trondheim, Norway</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15817v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| **[Language-Vision Planner and Executor for Text-to-Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07778v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Collapse: How Language-Centric Foundation Models Shape Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05850v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates; (ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Enigmata: Scaling Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Synthetic Verifiable Puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19914v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at https://seed-enigmata.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[VProChart: Answering Chart Question through Visual Perception Alignment Agent and Programmatic Solution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01667v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charts are widely used for data visualization across various fields, including education, research, and business. Chart Question Answering (CQA) is an emerging task focused on the automatic interpretation and reasoning of data presented in charts. However, chart images are inherently difficult to interpret, and chart-related questions often involve complex logical and numerical reasoning, which hinders the performance of existing models. This paper introduces VProChart, a novel framework designed to address these challenges in CQA by integrating a lightweight Visual Perception Alignment Agent (VPAgent) and a Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach. VPAgent aligns and models chart elements based on principles of human visual perception, enhancing the understanding of chart context. The Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to transform natural language reasoning questions into structured solution programs, facilitating precise numerical and logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ChartQA and PlotQA demonstrate that VProChart significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its capability in understanding and reasoning with charts.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowCoder-V2: Deep Knowledge Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06881v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR}) framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability. Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline. Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner. To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes, transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover, when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Logical Reasoning in LLMs: A Fine-Grained Evaluation and Supervision Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04810v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition, to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Reasoning Potential of Pre-trained LLMs by Critique Fine-Tuning on One Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03295v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Abductive visual Generation (AbdGen) approach to build such logic-integrated models. A vector-quantized symbol grounding mechanism and the corresponding disentanglement training method are introduced to enhance the controllability of logical symbols over generation. Furthermore, we propose two logical abduction methods to make our approach require few labeled training data and support the induction of latent logical generative rules from data. We experimentally show that our approach can be utilized to integrate various neural generative models with logical reasoning systems, by both learning from scratch or utilizing pre-trained models directly.

| **[OCRBench v2: An Improved Benchmark for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models on Visual Text Localization and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00321v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scoring the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has witnessed growing interest. Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation metrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with 1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed across both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's reliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that most LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

| **[Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.</p></details> |  |

However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Entailment Checking: Explore Eigenmarking Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03771v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic entailment is essential to reasoning, but entailment checking has the worst-case complexity of an exponential of the variable size. With recent development, quantum computing when mature may allow an effective approach for various combinatorial problems, including entailment checking. Grover algorithm uses Grover operations, selective phase inversion and amplitude amplification to address a search over unstructured data with quadratic improvement from a classical method. Its original form is intended to a single-winner scenario: exactly one match is promised. Its extension to multiple-winner cases employs probabilistic control over a number of applications of Grover operations, while a no-winner case is handled by time-out. Our study explores various schemes of ``eigenmarking'' approach. Still relying on Grover operations, but the approach introduces additional qubits to tag the eigenstates. The tagged eigenstates are to facilitate an interpretation of the measured results and enhance identification of a no-winner case (related to no logic violation in entailment context). Our investigation experiments three variations of eigenmarking on a two-qubit system using an IBM Aer simulator. The results show strong distinguishability in all schemes with the best relative distinguishabilities of 19 and 53 in worst case and in average case, respectively. Our findings reveal a viable quantum mechanism to differentiate a no-winner case from other scenarios, which could play a pivot role in entailment checking and logic reasoning in general.</p></details> | 8 pages |
