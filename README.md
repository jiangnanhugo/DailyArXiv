| **[Geometric Algorithms for Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24039v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19053v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of combinatorial action spaces. We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a novel actor-critic paradigm that embeds combinatorial optimization-layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope. Across six environments with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty, SRL matches or surpasses the performance of unstructured RL and imitation learning on static tasks and improves over these baselines by up to 92% on dynamic problems, with improved stability and convergence speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, accepted at the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23419v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MOOSE-Chem2: Exploring LLM Limits in Fine-Grained Scientific Hypothesis Discovery via Hierarchical Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19209v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Transformation Invariant Geometric Deep Learning: An Initial Representation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12345v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in the last decade. When designing neural networks to handle the ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, it is critical that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Most existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. In this paper, we revisit why general neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general plug-in for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling and feed the representations into existing neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method. We also extend our method into equivariance cases. Based on the results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered as an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |
| **[Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. II. Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed. In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers. Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularized Langevin Dynamics for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00277v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a simple yet effective sampling framework for combinatorial optimization (CO). Our method builds on discrete Langevin dynamics (LD), an efficient gradient-guided generative paradigm. However, we observe that directly applying LD often leads to limited exploration. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Regularized Langevin Dynamics (RLD), which enforces an expected distance between the sampled and current solutions, effectively avoiding local minima. We develop two CO solvers on top of RLD, one based on simulated annealing (SA), and the other one based on neural network (NN). Empirical results on three classic CO problems demonstrate that both of our methods can achieve comparable or better performance against the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) SA- and NN-based solvers. In particular, our SA algorithm reduces the runtime of the previous SOTA SA method by up to 80\%, while achieving equal or superior performance. In summary, RLD offers a promising framework for enhancing both traditional heuristics and NN models to solve CO problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shengyu-Feng/RLD4CO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Complexity Scaling Laws for Neural Models using Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12932v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 46 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |
| **[Probing Neural Combinatorial Optimization Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22131v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance, yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing (CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 16 figures. Accepted as Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural TSP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21693v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique, to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

| **[A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response, enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA, routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm, requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10 seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 8 figures,9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Oracle-Efficient Combinatorial Semi-Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21431v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards. Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in time, with strong theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Adaptive Non-uniform Timestep Sampling for Accelerating Diffusion Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09998v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration through Generation: Applying GFlowNets to Structured Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21886v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions. For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance, GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances where classical exact methods become infeasible.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Optimizing Feature Ordering in Radar Charts for Multi-Profile Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20738v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness'' across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial (exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity, practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement. Keywords: data visualization, radar charts, combinatorial optimization, minimax optimization, feature ordering</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 0-1 Integer Programs with Unknown Knapsack Constraints Using Membership Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14090v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with unknown knapsack constraints using a membership oracle for each unknown constraint such that, given a solution, the oracle determines whether the constraint is satisfied or not with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning for binary classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we devise a framework to solve the problem by learning and exploiting surrogate linear constraints. The framework includes training linear separators on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, a natural choice would be SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin, for each unknown constraint. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on classical problems and variants inspired by realistic applications to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of several metrics including objective value, dual bound and running time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Narrowing the LOCAL$\unicode{x2013}$CONGEST Gaps in Sparse Networks via Expander Decompositions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08093v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many combinatorial optimization problems can be approximated within $(1 \pm \epsilon)$ factors in $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$ rounds in the LOCAL model via network decompositions [Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus, STOC 2018]. These approaches require sending messages of unlimited size, so they do not extend to the CONGEST model, which restricts the message size to be $O(\log n)$ bits. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for obtaining $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$-round $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for many combinatorial optimization problems, including maximum weighted matching, maximum independent set, and correlation clustering, in graphs excluding a fixed minor in the CONGEST model. This class of graphs covers many sparse network classes that have been studied in the literature, including planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, and bounded-treewidth graphs. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be applied to give an efficient distributed property testing algorithm for an arbitrary minor-closed graph property that is closed under taking disjoint union, significantly generalizing the previous distributed property testing algorithm for planarity in [Levi, Medina, and Ron, PODC 2018 & Distributed Computing 2021]. Our framework uses distributed expander decomposition algorithms [Chang and Saranurak, FOCS 2020] to decompose the graph into clusters of high conductance. We show that any graph excluding a fixed minor admits small edge separators. Using this result, we show the existence of a high-degree vertex in each cluster in an expander decomposition, which allows the entire graph topology of the cluster to be routed to a vertex. Similar to the use of network decompositions in the LOCAL model, the vertex will be able to perform any local computation on the subgraph induced by the cluster and broadcast the result over the cluster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstrating Real Advantage of Machine-Learning-Enhanced Monte Carlo for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19544v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 ma...</summary><p>13 main pages, 6 main figures. 4 supplementary pages, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[A Probabilistic Computing Approach to the Closest Vector Problem for Lattice-Based Factoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19390v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The closest vector problem (CVP) is a fundamental optimization problem in lattice-based cryptography and its conjectured hardness underpins the security of lattice-based cryptosystems. Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring algorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems, including RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a heuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring algorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic optimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a hardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial optimization. In this work we investigate the application of probabilistic computing to the heuristic optimization task of CVP approximation refinement in lattice-based factoring. We present the design of a probabilistic computing algorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and experimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for solving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based factoring. The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding the maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem size and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice parameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number using up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical methods.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Network Prebunking Problem: Optimizing Prebunking Targets to Suppress the Spread of Misinformation in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01124v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as \textit{prebunking} has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the \textit{network prebunking problem}, which aims to select optimal prebunking targets that minimizes the spread of misinformation in a social network under limited intervention budgets. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that its objective function is monotone and submodular, which provides a theoretical foundation for approximation guarantees of greedy algorithms. However, since the greedy algorithm is computationally expensive and does not scale to large networks, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Markov Decision Process for Variable Selection in Branch & Bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19348v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions. Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics. Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalization, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose PARCO (Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization), a general reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key novel components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities.

| **[HeFS: Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection via Pareto-Optimized Genetic Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18575v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard. Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at https://healthinformaticslab.org/supp/.</p></details> |  |

In this context, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem for a mode-switching discrete-phase shifters simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided multi-antenna access point network, emphasizing hardware efficiency and reduced cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear optimization framework is formulated for joint optimization of the active beamforming matrix, user power allocation, and STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, including binary transmission/reflection amplitudes and discrete phase shifters. To solve the formulated problem, we employ a block coordinate descent method, dividing it into three subproblems tackled using difference-of-concave programming and combinatorial optimization techniques. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization approach, consistently achieving superior sum rate performance compared to partial optimization methods, thereby underscoring its potential for efficient and scalable 6G IoT systems.</p></details> | accepted by IEEE WCL |

This setting arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions. This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 19 figures, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme that obtains provably near-optimal solutions, building on the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. For a given $n \times m$ semi-orthogonal matrix, we derive a purely multiplicative approximation ratio for our algorithm, and show that it is never worse than $\max(2/(\pi m), 1/(\pi(\log (2m)+1)))$. We also show how to compute a tighter constant for a finite $(n,m)$ by solving a univariate optimization problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Overh...</summary><p>Overhauled approximation algorithm in orthogonally constrained case; now guarantee is purely multiplicative and logarithmic in number of columns</p></details> |

These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven.

To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

| **[High-Parallel FPGA-Based Discrete Simulated Bifurcation for Large-Scale Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12407v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity, making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Action Self-Improvement for Neural Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12273v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and the ability to learn coordinated behavior. We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries, we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared to standard self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thin Trees via $k$-Respecting Cut Identities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12050v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thin spanning trees lie at the intersection of graph theory, approximation algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. They are central to the long-standing \emph{thin tree conjecture}, which asks whether every $k$-edge-connected graph contains an $O(1/k)$-thin tree, and they underpin algorithmic breakthroughs such as the $O(\log n/\log\log n)$-approximation for ATSP. Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \emph{verifying} that a given tree is thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about exponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known. We introduce a new machinery of \emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which express the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$ edges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a tree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in $O_k(1)$ time. Building on this oracle, we give the first procedure to compute the exact $k$-thinness certificate $\Theta_k(T)$ of any spanning tree for fixed $k$ in time $\tilde O(n^2+n^k)$, outputting both the certificate value and a witnessing cut. Beyond general graphs, our framework yields sharper guarantees in structured settings. In planar graphs, duality with cycles and dual girth imply that every spanning tree admits a verifiable certificate $\Theta_k(T)\le k/\lambda$ (hence $O(1/\lambda)$ for constant $k$). In graphs embedded on a surface of genus $\gamma$, refined counting gives certified (per-cut) bounds $O((\log n+\gamma)/\lambda)$ via the same ensemble coverage.</p></details> |  |

Although optimal solutions to the associated smooth problem can be computed efficiently, existing adiabatic quantum optimization methods cannot leverage this information. Moreover, while various warm-starting strategies have been proposed for gate-based quantum optimization, none of them explicitly integrate insights from the relaxed continuous solution into the QUBO formulation. In this work, a novel approach is introduced that restricts the search space to discrete solutions in the vicinity of the continuous optimum by constructing a compact Hilbert space, thereby reducing the number of required qubits. Experiments on software solvers and a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17200v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent line of structured learning methods has advanced the practical state-of-the-art for combinatorial optimization problems with complex, application-specific objectives. These approaches learn policies that couple a statistical model with a tractable surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle, so as to exploit the distribution of problem instances instead of solving each instance independently. A core obstacle is that the empirical risk is then piecewise constant in the model parameters. This hinders gradient-based optimization and only few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. We address this issue by analyzing smoothed (perturbed) policies: adding controlled random perturbations to the direction used by the linear oracle yields a differentiable surrogate risk and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that decomposes the excess risk into perturbation bias, statistical estimation error, and optimization error. The analysis hinges on a new Uniform Weak (UW) property capturing the geometric interaction between the statistical model and the normal fan of the feasible polytope; we show it holds under mild assumptions, and automatically when a minimal baseline perturbation is present. The framework covers, in particular, contextual stochastic optimization. We illustrate the scope of the results on applications such as stochastic vehicle scheduling, highlighting how smoothing enables both tractable training and controlled generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main document, 3 pages supplement.

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO, a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, code available in https://github.com/jsalvasoler/difusco_ddea</p></details> |

Similar to Hopfield neural networks, oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) minimize an Ising energy function that embeds the solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite their success in solving unconstrained optimization problems, Ising machines still face challenges with constrained problems as they can become trapped in infeasible local minima. In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange ONN (LagONN) designed to escape infeasible states based on the theory of Lagrange multipliers. Unlike existing oscillatory Ising machines, LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to guide the system towards feasible states in an augmented energy landscape, settling only when constraints are met. Taking the maximum satisfiability problem with three literals as a use case (Max-3-SAT), we harness LagONN's constraint satisfaction mechanism to find optimal solutions for random SATlib instances with up to 200 variables and 860 clauses, which provides a deterministic alternative to simulated annealing for coupled oscillators. We benchmark LagONN with SAT solvers and further discuss the potential of Lagrange oscillators to address other constraints, such as phase copying, which is useful in oscillatory Ising machines with limited connectivity.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |

To further narrow the gap, learning-based approaches must efficiently explore the solution space during the search process. Recent approaches artificially increase exploration by enforcing diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules, however, these rules can impair solution quality and are difficult to design for more complex problems. In this paper, we introduce PolyNet, an approach for improving exploration of the solution space by learning complementary solution strategies. In contrast to other works, PolyNet uses only a single-decoder and a training schema that does not enforce diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules. We evaluate PolyNet on four combinatorial optimization problems and observe that the implicit diversity mechanism allows PolyNet to find better solutions than approaches that explicitly enforce diverse solution generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we initiate the study of its streaming complexity in general metric spaces with access to distance oracles. We give a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for estimating the Max-Cut value sliding-window streams using only poly-logarithmic space. This is the first sliding-window algorithm for Max-Cut even in Euclidean spaces, and it achieves a similar error-space tradeoff as the state-of-the-art insertion-only algorithms in Euclidean settings [Chen, Jiang, Krauthgamer, STOC'23], but without relying on Euclidean structures. In sharp contrast, we prove a polynomial-space lower bound for any $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-approximation in the dynamic streaming setting. This yields a separation from the Euclidean case, where the polylogarithmic-space $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation extends to dynamic streams. On the technical side, our sliding-window algorithm builds on the smooth histogram framework of [Braverman and Ostrovsky, SICOMP'10]. To make this framework applicable, we establish the first smoothness bound for metric Max-Cut. Moreover, we develop a streaming algorithm for metric Max-Cut in insertion-only streams, whose key ingredient is a new metric reservoir sampling technique.</p></details> |  |

In complexity, CVRP with k $\ge$ 3 is an NP-hard problem, and it is APX-hard as well. We already knew that it could not be approximated in metric space. Moreover, it is the first problem resisting Arora's famous approximation framework. So, whether there is, a polynomial-time (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation for the Euclidean CVRP for any $\epsilon>0$ is still an open problem.

Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at https://github.com/ZRNB/MG2FlowNet.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 tab...</summary><p>1 table, 6 figures. 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Accepted for the Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |
| **[Short circuit walks in fixed dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01916v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit augmentation schemes are a family of combinatorial algorithms for linear programming that generalize the simplex method. To solve the linear program, they construct a so-called monotone circuit walk: They start at an initial vertex of the feasible region and traverse a discrete sequence of points on the boundary, while moving along certain allowed directions (circuits) and improving the objective function at each step until reaching an optimum. Since the existence of short circuit walks has been conjectured (Circuit Diameter Conjecture), several works have investigated how well one can efficiently approximate shortest monotone circuit walks towards an optimum. A first result addressing this question was given by De Loera, Kafer, and Sanit\`a [SIAM J. Opt., 2022], who showed that given as input an LP and the starting vertex, finding a $2$-approximation for this problem is NP-hard. Cardinal and the third author [Math. Prog. 2023] gave a stronger lower bound assuming the exponential time hypothesis, showing that even an approximation factor of $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ is intractable for LPs defined by $m$ inequalities. Both of these results were based on reductions from highly degenerate polytopes in combinatorial optimization with high dimension. In this paper, we significantly strengthen the aforementioned hardness results by showing that for every fixed $\varepsilon>0$ approximating the problem on polygons with $m$ edges to within a factor of $O(m^{1-\varepsilon})$ is NP-hard. This result is essentially best-possible, as it cannot be improved beyond $o(m)$. In particular, this implies hardness for simple polytopes and in fixed dimension.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization with Order-Invariant Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01824v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs, which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies, improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Configuration Allocation in Pre-Production Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05147v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments. Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum advantages in ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01563v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that for any quantum Hamiltonian with an inverse-polynomial gap, the ground state can be prepared in a polynomial circuit depth to inverse-polynomial precision, if the system size is sufficiently large. The resulting circuit is composed of a polynomial number of Pauli rotations without ancilla qubit. Extending this result, we prove that for sufficiently large qubit number, any quantum state can be approximately prepared with a constant (polynomial) number of Pauli rotations to constant (inverse-polynomial) precision. Our theoretical findings reveal exponential quantum advantages in the prominent applications: ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lower Bound for the Max Entropy Algorithm for TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01950v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most famous conjectures in combinatorial optimization is the four-thirds conjecture, which states that the integrality gap of the subtour LP relaxation of the TSP is equal to $\frac43$. For 40 years, the best known upper bound was 1.5, due to Wolsey (1980). Recently, Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan (2022) showed that the max entropy algorithm for the TSP gives an improved bound of $1.5 - 10^{-36}$. In this paper, we show that the approximation ratio of the max entropy algorithm is at least 1.375, even for graphic TSP. Thus the max entropy algorithm does not appear to be the algorithm that will ultimately resolve the four-thirds conjecture in the affirmative, should that be possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Census Data Generation via Multidimensional Multiset Sum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The US Decennial Census provides valuable data for both research and policy purposes. Census data are subject to a variety of disclosure avoidance techniques prior to release in order to preserve respondent confidentiality. While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by a critical lack of data: The underlying "microdata," which serve as necessary input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting. While the problem we study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance. Finally, we verify that the data we produce are "close" to the desired ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to enhance their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal and is under review</p></details> |
| **[Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompts and Heuristics for Automatic Algorithm Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24509v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, an increasing number of learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning with Local Search MCMC Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14240v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metric Representations of Network Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00164v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks are structures that encode relationships between pairs of elements or nodes. However, there is no imposed connection between these relationships, i.e., the relationship between two nodes can be independent of every other one in the network, and need not be defined for every possible pair of nodes. This is not true for metric spaces, where the triangle inequality imposes conditions that must be satisfied by triads of distances in the space, and these distances must be defined for every pair of nodes. In this paper, we study how to project networks into q-metric spaces, a generalization of metric spaces that encompasses a larger class of structured representations. In order to do this, we encode as axioms two intuitively desirable properties of the mentioned projections. We show that there is only one way of projecting networks onto q-metric spaces satisfying these axioms. Moreover, for the special case of (regular) metric spaces, this method boils down to computing the shortest path between every node and, for the case of ultrametric spaces, it coincides with single linkage hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we show that the projection method satisfies two properties of practical relevance: optimality, which enables its utilization for the efficient estimation of combinatorial optimization problems, and nestedness, which entails consistency of the structure induced when projecting onto different q-metric spaces. Finally, we illustrate how metric projections can be used to efficiently search networks aided by metric trees.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[A Near-Real-Time Reduction-Based Algorithm for Coloring Massive Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23606v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph coloring problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem with important applications such as register allocation and task scheduling, and it has been extensively studied for decades. However, near-real-time algorithms that can deliver high-quality solutions for very large real-world graphs within a strict time frame remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by systematically investigating reduction rules that shrink the problem size while preserving optimality. For the first time, domination reduction, complement crown reduction, and independent set reduction are applied to large-scale instances. Building on these techniques, we propose RECOL, a reduction-based algorithm that alternates between fast estimation of lower and upper bounds, graph reductions, and heuristic coloring. We evaluate RECOL on a wide range of benchmark datasets, including SNAP, the Network Repository, DIMACS10, and DIMACS2. Experimental results show that RECOL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on very large sparse graphs within one minute. Additional experiments further highlight the pivotal role of reduction techniques in achieving this performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTSP: A Vision Language Models Guided Framework for Large-Scale Traveling Salesman Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23465v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling, and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration. While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for integration into more complex logistics systems.

| **[AutoEP: LLMs-Driven Automation of Hyperparameter Evolution for Metaheuristic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23189v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation, they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design.

| **[IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SB, C...</summary><p>SB, CD, SC, KL are equally contributing authors</p></details> |

| **[FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a 3D optimization framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse operational contexts.</p></details> |  |

We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing open boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions are gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational costs of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Yang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a clear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we check at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this approach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions in the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more efficient future flow-based solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>1+39 ...</summary><p>1+39 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

| **[PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25693v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |
| **[SGFusion: Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23455v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph (HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step, every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have "higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights." SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches without notable cost in system scalability.</p></details> |  |

Permutation sets on $\mathbb T^2$ and Latin hypercube sets in higher dimensions (i.e. sets whose projections onto coordinate axes are equispaced points) are natural candidates to be energy minimizers. We show that such point configurations that have only one distance in the vector sense minimize the energy for a wide range of potentials, in other words, such sets satisfy a tensor product version of universal optimality. This applies, in particular, to three- and five-point Fibonacci lattices. We also characterize all lattices with this property and exhibit some non-lattice sets of this type. In addition, we obtain several further structural results about global and local minimizers of tensor product energies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling for Secure RIS-Assisted ISAC in 6G UAV Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25411v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) corridors in sixth-generation (6G) networks requires safe, intelligence-driven integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance spectrum efficiency, localisation accuracy, and situational awareness, while introducing new vulnerabilities. The rise of quantum computing increases the risks associated with harvest-now-decrypt-later strategies and quantum-enhanced spoofing. We propose a Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling (QRTM) framework for RIS-assisted ISAC in UAV corridors to address these challenges. QRTM integrates classical, quantum-ready, and quantum-aided adversaries, countered using post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives: ML-KEM for key establishment and Falcon for authentication, both embedded within RIS control signalling and UAV coordination. To strengthen security sensing, the framework introduces RIS-coded scene watermarking validated through a generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT), with its detection probability characterised by the Marcum Q function. Furthermore, a Secure ISAC Utility (SIU) jointly optimises secrecy rate, spoofing detection, and throughput under RIS constraints, enabled by a scheduler with computational complexity of O(n^2). Monte Carlo evaluations using 3GPP Release 19 mid-band urban-canyon models (7-15 GHz) demonstrate a spoof-detection probability approaching 0.99 at a false-alarm rate of 1e-3, secrecy-rate retention exceeding 90 percent against quantum-capable adversaries, and signal-interference utilisation improvements of about 25 percent compared with baselines. These results show a standards-compliant path towards reliable, quantum-resilient ISAC for UAV corridors in smart cities and non-terrestrial networks.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 5figures |

On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework, which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable selection in convex nonparametric least squares via structured Lasso: An application to the Swedish electricity distribution networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01911v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of variable selection in convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS). Whereas the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is a popular technique for least squares, its variable selection performance is unknown in CNLS problems. In this work, we investigate the performance of the Lasso estimator and find out it is usually unable to select variables efficiently. Exploiting the unique structure of the subgradients in CNLS, we develop a structured Lasso method by combining $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_{\infty}$-norm. The relaxed version of the structured Lasso is proposed for achieving model sparsity and predictive performance simultaneously, where we can control the two effects--variable selection and model shrinkage--using separate tuning parameters. A Monte Carlo study is implemented to verify the finite sample performance of the proposed approaches. We also use real data from Swedish electricity distribution networks to illustrate the effects of the proposed variable selection techniques. The results from the simulation and application confirm that the proposed structured Lasso performs favorably, generally leading to sparser and more accurate predictive models, relative to the conventional Lasso methods in the literature.</p></details> |  |

We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First, unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-Centered WoS-Type Solvers with Statistical Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25152v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic PDE solvers have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional discretization-based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in geometry processing and graphics. While off-centered estimators enhance sample reuse in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers, they introduce correlation artifacts and bias when Green's functions are approximated. In this paper, we propose a statistically weighted off-centered WoS-type estimator that leverages local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across neighboring evaluation points. Our method balances bias and variance through a principled weighting strategy that suppresses unreliable estimators. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on various PDEs,including screened Poisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements over existing solvers such as vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and boundary value caching. Our method also naturally extends to gradient field estimation and mixed boundary problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Learning Hamiltonian flows from numerical integrators and examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25107v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian systems with multiple timescales arise in molecular dynamics, classical mechanics, and theoretical physics. Long-time numerical integration of such systems requires resolving fast dynamics with very small time steps, which incurs a high computational cost - especially in ensemble simulations for uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, or varying initial conditions. We present a Deep Learning framework that learns the flow maps of Hamiltonian systems to accelerate long-time and ensemble simulations. Neural networks are trained, according to a chosen numerical scheme, either entirely without data to approximate flows over large time intervals or with data to learn flows in intervals far from the initial time. For the latter, we propose a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-based data generator. The architecture consists of simple feedforward networks that incorporate truncated Taylor expansions of the flow map, with a neural network remainder capturing unresolved effects. Applied to benchmark non-integrable and non-canonical systems, the method achieves substantial speedups while preserving accuracy, enabling scalable simulation of complex Hamiltonian dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Energy Models: Fast and Interpretable Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14167v6)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers a powerful framework for generation across many data modalities. However, it remains unclear how its interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. We propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Energy Model (KAEM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, KAEM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling (IS) becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient posterior sampler. For domains where IS fails, we introduce a strategy based on population-based LMC, decomposing the posterior into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve LMC mixing. KAEM balances common generative modeling trade-offs, offering fast inference, interpretability, and stable training, while being naturally suited to Zettascale Computing hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Black Box Variational Inference Scheme for Inverse Problems with Demanding Physics-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25038v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian methods are particularly effective for addressing inverse problems due to their ability to manage uncertainties inherent in the inference process. However, employing these methods with costly forward models poses significant challenges, especially in the context of non-differentiable models, where the absence of likelihood model gradient information can result in high computational costs. To tackle this issue, we develop a novel Bayesian inference approach based on black box variational inference, utilizing importance sampling to reuse existing simulation model calls in the variational objective gradient estimation, without relying on forward model gradients. The novelty lies in a new batch-sequential sampling procedure, which only requires new model evaluations if the currently available model evaluations fail to yield a suitable approximation of the objective gradient. The resulting approach reduces computational costs by leading to variational parameter updates without requiring new model evaluations when possible, while adaptively increasing the number of model calls per iteration as needed. In combination with its black box nature, this new approach is suitable for inverse problems involving demanding physics-based models that lack model gradients. We demonstrate the efficiency gains of the proposed method compared to its baseline version, sequential Monte Carlo, and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo in diverse benchmarks, ranging from density matching to the Bayesian calibration of a nonlinear electro-chemo-mechanical model for solid-state batteries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knots and variance ordering of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01901v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, or particle filters, are widely used for approximating intractable integrals, particularly those arising in Bayesian inference and state-space models. We introduce a new variance reduction technique, the knot operator, which improves the efficiency of particle filters by incorporating potential function information into part, or all, of a transition kernel. The knot operator induces a partial ordering of Feynman-Kac models that implies an order on the asymptotic variance of particle filters, offering a new approach to algorithm design. We discuss connections to existing strategies for designing efficient particle filters, including model marginalisation. Our theory generalises such techniques and provides quantitative asymptotic variance ordering results. We revisit the fully-adapted (auxiliary) particle filter using our theory of knots to show how a small modification guarantees an asymptotic variance ordering for all relevant test functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages (33 main text), 5 figures</p></details> |

By applying a stochastic Pontryagin's maximum principle, we characterize the optimal state-control pair via a coupled forward-backward SPDE system. We propose an implementable discretization using conforming finite elements in space and an implicit midpoint rule in time. By a new technical approach we obtain strong convergence rates for the discrete state-control pair without relying on Malliavin calculus. For the practical computation we develop a gradient-descent algorithm based on artificial iterates that employs an exact computation for the arising conditional expectations, thereby eliminating costly Monte Carlo sampling. Consequently, each iteration has a computational cost that is proportional to the number of spatial degrees of freedom, producing a scalable method that preserves the established strong convergence rates. Numerical results validate its efficiency.</p></details> | 37 pages, 16 figures |

In this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized controller compared to its centralized counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a conference for possible publication and is under review.

| **[Fast Bayesian Multilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24604v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo (MLQMC) methods often rely on multiple independent randomizations of a low-discrepancy (LD) sequence to estimate statistical errors on each level. While this approach is standard, it can be less efficient than simply increasing the number of points from a single LD sequence. However, a single LD sequence does not permit statistical error estimates in the current framework. We propose to recast the MLQMC problem in a Bayesian cubature framework, which uses a single LD sequence and quantifies numerical error through the posterior variance of a Gaussian process (GP) model. When paired with certain LD sequences, GP regression and hyperparameter optimization can be carried out at only $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ cost, where $n$ is the number of samples. Building on the adaptive sample allocation used in traditional MLQMC, where the number of samples is doubled on the level with the greatest expected benefit, we introduce a new Bayesian utility function that balances the computational cost of doubling against the anticipated reduction in posterior uncertainty. We also propose a new digitally-shift-invariant (DSI) kernel of adaptive smoothness, which combines multiple higher-order DSI kernels through a weighted sum of smoothness parameters, for use with fast digital net GPs. A series of numerical experiments illustrate the performance of our fast Bayesian MLQMC method and error estimates for both single-level problems and multilevel problems with a fixed number of levels. The Bayesian error estimates obtained using digital nets are found to be reliable, although, in some cases, mildly conservative.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Optimal Spatial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22330v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in anomaly detection problems recently, whilst their focuses are mostly on anomalies taking place on the time index. In this work, we investigate a new anomaly-in-mean problem in multidimensional spatial lattice, that is, to detect the number and locations of anomaly ''spatial regions'' from the baseline. In addition to the classic minimisation over the cost function with a $L_0$ penalisation, we introduce an innovative penalty on the area of the minimum convex hull that covers the anomaly regions. We show that the proposed method yields a consistent estimation of the number of anomalies, and it achieves near optimal localisation error under the minimax framework. We also propose a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the double penalised cost minimisation approximately, and carry out large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to examine its numeric performance. The method has a wide range of applications in real-world problems. As an example, we apply it to detect the marine heatwaves using the sea surface temperature data from the European Space Agency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pair Approximation Meets Reality: Diffusion of Innovation in Organizational Networks within the biased-independence q-Voter Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24447v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective adaptation, whether in innovation adoption, pro-environmental or organizational change, emerges from the interplay between individual decisions and social influence. Agent-based modeling provides a useful tool for studying such processes. Here, we introduce the biased-independence $q$-voter model, a generalization of the $q$-voter model with independence, one of the most popular agent-based models of opinion dynamics. In our model, individuals choose between two options, adopt or not adopt, under the competing influences of conformity and independent choice. Independent choice between two options is determined by an engagement parameter, inspired by earlier agent-based model of eco-innovation diffusion. When the engagement parameter equals $0.5$, the model reduces to the original $q$-voter model with independence; values different from $0.5$ break the symmetry between the two options. To place our study in a broader context, we briefly review asymmetric versions of the $q$-voter model proposed to date. The novelty of this work goes beyond introducing a generalized model: we develop the pair approximation (PA) for an asymmetric $q$-voter model and, for the first time, validate it on empirical organizational networks. Our results show that the interplay of social influence, independence, and option preference generates discontinuous phase transitions and irreversible hysteresis, reflecting path-dependent adoption dynamics. Surprisingly, the PA agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations on some empirical networks, even small ones, highlighting its potential as a computationally efficient bridge between individual decision-making and collective actions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

This paper formally challenges the economic validity of this widespread assumption, arguing that the true bottom-line economic utility of a human-machine skill policy is dangerously misunderstood and highly contingent on situational and design factors. To investigate this gap, we develop an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical pragmatism to quantify the economic impact of human and machine skills in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results show that a human-machine strategy can yield the highest economic utility in complex scenarios, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine approach can perform worse than either the machine-exclusive or the human-exclusive policy, actively destroying value under the pressure of costs that are not compensated by sufficient performance gains. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: when the context is complex and critical, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task may be insufficient, and far from being a silver-bullet solution or a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research report (v4, 90+ pages) is now repackaged into a draft paper (v5, 18 pages); results unchanged; extended considerations; improved layout and readability</p></details> |
| **[Self-Normalized Quantile Empirical Saddlepoint Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24352v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a density-free method for frequentist inference on population quantiles, termed Self-Normalized Quantile Empirical Saddlepoint Approximation (SNQESA). The approach builds a self-normalized pivot from the indicator score for a fixed quantile threshold and then employs a constrained empirical saddlepoint approximation to obtain highly accurate tail probabilities. Inverting these tail areas yields confidence intervals and tests without estimating the unknown density at the target quantile, thereby eliminating bandwidth selection and the boundary issues that affect kernel-based Wald/Hall-Sheather intervals. Under mild local regularity, the resulting procedures attain higher-order tail accuracy and second-order coverage after inversion. Because the pivot is anchored in a bounded Bernoulli reduction, the method remains reliable for skewed and heavy-tailed distributions and for extreme quantiles. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments across light, heavy, and multimodal distributions demonstrate that SNQESA delivers stable coverage and competitive interval lengths in small to moderate samples while being orders of magnitude faster than large-B resampling schemes. An empirical study on Value-at-Risk with rolling windows further highlights the gains in tail performance and computational efficiency. The framework naturally extends to two-sample quantile differences and to regression-type settings, offering a practical, analytically transparent alternative to kernel, bootstrap, and empirical-likelihood methods for distribution-free quantile inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Intra-Abstraction Policies For Non-exact Abstraction Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24297v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings.</p></details> |  |

Reliability Analysis in Detection & Generation Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17550v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the ICCV 2025 workshop - STREAM</p></details> |

Thus, autonomous methods are being developed to enable safe navigation and control around small bodies. These methods often involve using Optical Navigation (OpNav) to determine the spacecraft's location. Ensuring OpNav reliability would allow the spacecraft to maintain an accurate state estimate throughout its mission. This research presents an observability-constrained Lyapunov controller that steers a spacecraft to a desired target orbit while guaranteeing continuous OpNav observability. We design observability path constraints to avoid regions where horizon-based OpNav methods exhibit poor performance, ensuring control input that maintains good observability. This controller is implemented with a framework that simulates small body dynamics, synthetic image generation, edge detection, horizon-based OpNav, and filtering. We evaluate the approach in two representative scenarios, orbit maintenance and approach with circularization, around spherical and ellipsoidal target bodies. In Monte Carlo simulations, the proposed approach improves the rate of attaining target orbits without observability violations by up to 94% compared to an unconstrained Lyapunov baseline, demonstrating improved robustness over conventional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 18 figures, published in the Journal of the Astronautical Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Information-Theoretic Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24088v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE) relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood.

| **[Assessing the influence of social media feedback on traveler's future trip-planning behavior: A multi-model machine learning approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24077v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the surge of domestic tourism in India and the influence of social media on young tourists, this paper aims to address the research question on how "social return" - responses received on social media sharing - of recent trip details can influence decision-making for short-term future travels. The paper develops a multi-model framework to build a predictive machine learning model that establishes a relationship between a traveler's social return, various social media usage, trip-related factors, and her future trip-planning behavior. The primary data was collected via a survey from Indian tourists. After data cleaning, the imbalance in the data was addressed using a robust oversampling method, and the reliability of the predictive model was ensured by applying a Monte Carlo cross-validation technique. The results suggest at least 75% overall accuracy in predicting the influence of social return on changing the future trip plan. Moreover, the model fit results provide crucial practical implications for the domestic tourism sector in India with future research directions concerning social media, destination marketing, smart tourism, heritage tourism, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 10 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Amortized variational transdimensional inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04749v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressiveness of flow-based models combined with stochastic variational inference (SVI) has expanded the application of optimization-based Bayesian inference to highly complex problems. However, despite the importance of multi-model Bayesian inference, defined over a transdimensional joint model and parameter space, flow-based SVI has been limited to problems defined over a fixed-dimensional parameter space. We introduce CoSMIC normalizing flows (COntextually-Specified Masking for Identity-mapped Components), an extension to neural autoregressive conditional normalizing flow architectures that enables use of a single amortized variational density for inference over a transdimensional (multi-model) conditional target distribution. We propose a combined stochastic variational transdimensional inference (VTI) approach to training CoSMIC flows using ideas from Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo gradient estimation. Numerical experiments show the performance of VTI on challenging problems that scale to high-cardinality model spaces.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |
| **[MASPRM: Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24803v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) demands strong test-time performance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to partial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller. MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts without requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local targets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing computation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH, MASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final answer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by $+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers zero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same budget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and complements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware multi-agent reasoning.

| **[Fast Bayesian Basis Selection for Functional Data Representation with Correlated Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20758v4)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis finds widespread application across various fields. While functional data are intrinsically infinite-dimensional, in practice, they are observed only at a finite set of points, typically over a dense grid. As a result, smoothing techniques are often used to approximate the observed data as functions. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for selecting basis functions for smoothing one or multiple curves simultaneously. Our method differentiates from other Bayesian approaches in two key ways: (i) by accounting for correlated errors and (ii) by developing a variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm, which is faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as Gibbs sampling. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method effectively identifies the true underlying structure of the data across various scenarios, and it is applicable to different types of functional data. Our VEM algorithm not only recovers the basis coefficients and the correct set of basis functions but also estimates the existing within-curve correlation. When applied to the motorcycle, LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) experiment and Canadian weather datasets, our method demonstrates comparable, and in some cases superior, performance in terms of adjusted R2 compared to regression splines, smoothing splines, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Bayesian LASSO. Our proposed method is implemented in R and codes are available at https://github.com/acarolcruz/VB-Bases-Selection</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages (30 in the main text and 11 in the supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[REASONING COMPILER: LLM-Guided Optimizations for Efficient Model Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01374v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We demonstrate that such algorithms efficiently optimize physical observables such as axion decay constants or axion-photon couplings in string theory compactifications. For our implementation, we choose a parameterization of triangulations that yields homotopy inequivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds by extending fine, regular triangulations of two-faces, thereby eliminating exponentially large redundancy factors in the map from polytope triangulations to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In particular, we discuss how this encoding renders the entire Kreuzer-Skarke list amenable to a variety of optimization strategies, including but not limited to Genetic Algorithms. To achieve optimal performance, we tune the hyperparameters of our Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian optimization. We find that our implementation vastly outperforms other sampling and optimization strategies like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Simulated Annealing. Finally, we showcase that our Genetic Algorithm efficiently performs optimization even for the maximal polytope with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1} = 491$, where we use it to maximize axion-photon couplings.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Covariate-dependent hierarchical Dirichlet processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02676v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian hierarchical modeling is a natural framework to effectively integrate data and borrow information across groups. In this paper, we address problems related to density estimation and identifying clusters across related groups, by proposing a hierarchical Bayesian approach that incorporates additional covariate information. To achieve flexibility, our approach builds on ideas from Bayesian nonparametrics, combining the hierarchical Dirichlet process with dependent Dirichlet processes. The proposed model is widely applicable, accommodating multiple and mixed covariate types through appropriate kernel functions as well as different output types through suitable component-specific likelihoods. This extends our ability to discern the relationship between covariates and clusters, while also effectively borrowing information and quantifying differences across groups. By employing a data augmentation trick, we are able to tackle the intractable normalized weights and construct a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. The proposed method is illustrated on simulated data and two real data sets on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and calcium imaging. For scRNA-seq data, we show that the incorporation of cell dynamics facilitates the discovery of additional cell subgroups. On calcium imaging data, our method identifies interpretable clusters of time frames with similar neural activity, aligning with the observed behavior of the animal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relaxed Sequence Sampling for Diverse Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23786v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization (RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors, balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$ greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost. These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring the protein design landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[A modified particle filter that reduces weight collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23740v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle filters are a widely used Monte Carlo based data assimilation technique that estimates the probability distribution of a system's state conditioned on observations through a collection of weights and particles. A known problem for particle filters is weight collapse, or degeneracy, where a single weight attains a value of one while all others are close to zero, thereby collapsing the estimated distribution. We address this issue by introducing a novel modification to the particle filter that is simple to implement and inspired by energy-based diversity measures. Our approach adjusts particle weights to minimize a two-body energy potential, promoting balanced weight distributions and mitigating collapse. We demonstrate the performance of this modified particle filter in a series of numerical experiments with linear and nonlinear dynamical models, where we compare with the classical particle filter and ensemble Kalman filters in the nonlinear case. We find that our new approach improves weight distributions compared to the classical particle filter and thereby improve state estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stochastic (N-1)-Secure Redispatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23551v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an (N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |

Exploration beyond wild-type neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing algorithms such as Reversible Recombination (RevReCom) and Metropolized Forest Recombination (MFR) are constrained to sampling from distributions related to spanning trees. We introduce the marked edge walk (MEW), a novel MCMC algorithm for sampling from the space of graph partitions under a tunable distribution. The walk operates on the space of spanning trees with marked edges, allowing for calculable transition probabilities for use in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Empirical results on real-world dual graphs show convergence under target distributions unrelated to spanning trees. For this reason, MEW represents an advancement in flexible ensemble generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Multilevel Splitting: First Application to Rare-Event Derivative Pricing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23461v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work analyzes the computational burden of pricing binary options in rare-event settings and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo is inefficient for deep out of the money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and low exercise probabilities, requiring very large samples for accurate estimates. An AMS scheme is developed for binary options under Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics, reformulating the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events. Numerical experiments compare the method to Monte Carlo and to other techniques such as antithetic variables and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) across four contracts: European digital calls and puts, and Asian digital calls and puts. Results show up to a 200-fold computational gain for deep out-of-the-money cases while preserving unbiasedness. No evidence is found of prior applications of AMS to financial derivatives. The approach improves pricing efficiency for rare-event contracts such as parametric insurance and catastrophe linked securities. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided, supporting multiple discretizations and importance functions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Psi-Sampler: Initial Particle Sampling for SMC-Based Inference-Time Reward Alignment in Score Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01320v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

| **[Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10268v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier (upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes, achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model. In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution, quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than parametric variational cut approaches.</p></details> |  |

Such results can be used to establish central limit theorems (CLT) that enable error evaluations of Monte Carlo estimates in practice. However, convergence analysis based on TV distance is often non-scalable to high-dimensional Markov chains (Qin and Hobert (2018); Rajaratnam and Sparks (2015)). Alternatively, robust bounds in Wasserstein distance are often easier to obtain, thanks to a coupling argument. Our work is concerned with the implication of such convergence results, in particular, do they lead to CLTs of the corresponding Markov chains? One indirect and typically non-trivial way is to first convert Wasserstein bounds into total variation bounds. Alternatively, we provide two CLTs that directly depend on (sub-geometric) convergence rates in Wasserstein distance. Our CLTs hold for Lipschitz functions under certain moment conditions. We also present two possible ways to lift obtained CLTs to a larger weighted Lipschitz class of functions. We further take an analytic route to obtain CLTs for a weighted Sobolev class based on $W_2$ convergence. Finally, we apply these CLTs to four sets of Markov chain examples including a class of nonlinear autoregressive processes, an exponential integrator version of the metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (EI-MALA), an unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), and a special autoregressive model that generates reducible chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added section 3.3 and 3.4 in this version</p></details> |

Comparisons based on a range of IPPC benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.</p></details> |  |

We define a generalized form of Jeffreys's approximate objective Bayes factor (eJAB), a one-line calculation that is a function of the p-value, sample size, and parameter dimension. We establish conditions under which eJAB is model-selection consistent and verify them for ten statistical tests. We assess finite-sample accuracy by comparing eJAB with Markov chain Monte Carlo computed Bayes factors in 12 simulation studies. We then apply eJAB to 71,126 results from ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG) and find that the proportion of findings with $\text{p-value} \le \alpha$ yet $eJAB_{01}>1$ (favoring the null) closely tracks the significance level $\alpha$, suggesting that such contradictions are pointing to the type I errors. We catalog 4,088 such candidate type I errors and provide details for 131 with reported $\text{p-value} \le 0.01$. We also identify 487 instances of the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox. Finally, we estimate that 75% (6%) of clinical trial plans from CTG set $\alpha \ge 0.05$ as the target evidence threshold, and that 35.5% (0.22%) of results significant at $\alpha =0.05$ correspond to evidence that is no stronger than anecdotal under eJAB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is appended</p></details> |

Our approach builds on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.</p></details> |  |

Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents. Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative policy optimization (Tree-GRPO) integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 46.27% (multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% (textual) and 44.03% (multi-modal) without ground truth reward, surpassing all open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

A recently published conjecture that is relevant to the correctness of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for directed flag complexes states that any simple oriented graph admits a flip sequence that monotonically decreases the number of directed 3-cycles to zero, and is known to be true for complete oriented graphs. We show that, in general, this conjecture does not hold. As main tool for disproving the conjecture, we introduce the concept of FBD-graphs (fully blocked digraphs). An FBD-graph is a directed graph that does not contain any directed 1-, 2-, or 3-cycles, and for which any edge-flip creates a directed 3-cycle. We prove that the non-existence of FBD-graphs is a necessary condition for the conjecture to hold and succeed in constructing FBD-graphs. On the other hand, we show that complete graphs, as well as graphs in which every edge is incident to at most two triangles, cannot be fully blocked. In addition to being relevant for determining in which cases the above mentioned sampling process is correct, the concept of FBD-graphs might also be useful for other problems and yields interesting questions for further study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Solve...</summary><p>Solves open Conjecture first stated in arXiv:2309.02938</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01993v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian learning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior distribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior distribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on randomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large datasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents subject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms cannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms, where Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents without sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms induce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias persists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects. Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized optimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we show that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds that significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the literature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

| **[MoveOD: Synthesizing Origin-Destination Commute Distribution from U.S. Census Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18858v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution origin-destination (OD) tables are essential for a wide spectrum of transportation applications, from modeling traffic and signal timing optimization to congestion pricing and vehicle routing. However, outside a handful of data rich cities, such data is rarely available. We introduce MOVEOD, an open-source pipeline that synthesizes public data into commuter OD flows with fine-grained spatial and temporal departure times for any county in the United States. MOVEOD combines five open data sources: American Community Survey (ACS) departure time and travel time distributions, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES) residence-to-workplace flows, county geometries, road network information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), and building footprints from OSM and Microsoft, into a single OD dataset. We use a constrained sampling and integer-programming method to reconcile the OD dataset with data from ACS and LODES. Our approach involves: (1) matching commuter totals per origin zone, (2) aligning workplace destinations with employment distributions, and (3) calibrating travel durations to ACS-reported commute times. This ensures the OD data accurately reflects commuting patterns. We demonstrate the framework on Hamilton County, Tennessee, where we generate roughly 150,000 synthetic trips in minutes, which we feed into a benchmark suite of classical and learning-based vehicle-routing algorithms. The MOVEOD pipeline is an end-to-end automated system, enabling users to easily apply it across the United States by giving only a county and a year; and it can be adapted to other countries with comparable census datasets. The source code and a lightweight browser interface are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures (including 3 validation charts and 1 map visualization).

| **[SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample-then-Filter in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Dikin-Langevin diffusion for polyhedra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04582v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interior-point geometry offers a straightforward approach to constrained sampling and optimization on polyhedra, eliminating reflections and ad hoc projections. We exploit the Dikin log-barrier to define a Dikin--Langevin diffusion whose drift and noise are modulated by the inverse barrier Hessian. In continuous time, we establish a boundary no-flux property; trajectories started in the interior remain in $U$ almost surely, so feasibility is maintained by construction. For computation, we adopt a discretize-then-correct design: an Euler--Maruyama proposal with state-dependent covariance, followed by a Metropolis--Hastings correction that targets the exact constrained law and reduces to a Dikin random walk when $f$ is constant. Numerically, the unadjusted diffusion exhibits the expected first-order step size bias, while the MH-adjusted variant delivers strong convergence diagnostics on anisotropic, box-constrained Gaussians (rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ concentrated near $1$) and higher inter-well transition counts on a bimodal target, indicating superior cross-well mobility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that coupling calibrated stochasticity with interior-point preconditioning provides a practical, reflection-free approach to sampling and optimization over polyhedral domains, offering clear advantages near faces, corners, and in nonconvex landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[EconProver: Towards More Economical Test-Time Scaling for Automated Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12603v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Piecewise Deterministic Sampling for Constrained Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05462v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel class of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP) that are designed to sample from constrained probability distributions $\pi$ supported on a convex set $\mathcal{M}$. This class of PDMPs adapts the concept of a mirror map from convex optimisation to address sampling problems. Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Stochastic Entanglement Configuration for Constructive Entanglement Topologies in Quantum Machine Learning with Application to Cardiac MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11401v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CSC-MPPI: A Novel Constrained MPPI Framework with DBSCAN for Reliable Obstacle Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16386v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes Constrained Sampling Cluster Model Predictive Path Integral (CSC-MPPI), a novel constrained formulation of MPPI designed to enhance trajectory optimization while enforcing strict constraints on system states and control inputs. Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chance-Constrained Sampling-Based MPC for Collision Avoidance in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08520v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating safely in dynamic and uncertain environments is challenging due to uncertainties in perception and motion. This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |

We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics.

| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

At the moment, there is only one test suggested that relies upon random projections. We propose a novel test termed {\alpha}-Energy Based Test ({\alpha}-EBT) to compare the multivariate distributions of two (or more) compositional data sets. Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Learning at a Glance: Towards Interpretable Data-limited Continual Semantic Segmentation via Semantic-Invariance Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15429v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual semantic segmentation (CSS) based on incremental learning (IL) is a great endeavour in developing human-like segmentation models. However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

With this work we aim to provide an integrative view and framework to combine methods from the fields of MCMC, constrained optimization, as well as robotics, and gain insights in their strengths from empirical evaluations. We propose NLP Sampling as a general problem formulation, propose a family of restarting two-phase methods as a framework to integrated methods from across the fields, and evaluate them on analytical and robotic manipulation planning problems. Complementary to this, we provide several conceptual discussions, e.g. on the role of Lagrange parameters, global sampling, and the idea of a Diffused NLP and a corresponding model-based denoising sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Algorithms for Weighted Constrained Sampling and Weighted Model Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12816v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problems of weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, where we are given a propositional formula and a weight for each world. The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm for approximate sampling from distributions whose support is a compact and convex set. This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

When qualified volunteers are more than the budget allowed, we recommend a D-optimal sampling strategy based on the optimal design theory and develop a constrained lift-one algorithm to find the optimal allocation. Unlike the literature which mainly deals with linear models, our solution solves the constrained sampling problem under fairly general statistical models, including generalized linear models and multinomial logistic models, and with more general constraints. We justify theoretically the optimality of our sampling strategy and show by simulation studies and real-world examples the advantages over simple random sampling and proportionally stratified sampling strategies.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Penalized Overdamped and Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00570v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution $\pi(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ when $x$ is constrained to lie on a convex body $\mathcal{C}$. Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |

In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |

Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation.

However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

| **[Unbiased simulation of rare events in continuous time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08057v2)** | 2021-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For rare events described in terms of Markov processes, truly unbiased estimation of the rare event probability generally requires the avoidance of numerical approximations of the Markov process. Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Efficient constrained sampling via the mirror-Langevin algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16212v2)** | 2021-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new discretization of the mirror-Langevin diffusion and give a crisp proof of its convergence. Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01581v4)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Back-translation for Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08712v1)** | 2021-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper illustrates our approach to the shared task on large-scale multilingual machine translation in the sixth conference on machine translation (WMT-21). This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS4Net: Two-Stage Sample Selective Strategy for Rotating Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03116v1)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using the Prior Implicit in a Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13640v3)** | 2021-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior probability models are a fundamental component of many image processing problems, but density estimation is notoriously difficult for high-dimensional signals such as photographic images. Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

For each problem, we propose a privacy preserving algorithm using stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques, and show that it can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. To the best of our knowledge, SSCA has not been used for solving federated optimization, and federated optimization with nonconvex constraints has not been investigated. Next, we customize the two proposed SSCA-based algorithms to two application examples, and provide closed-form solutions for the respective approximate convex problems at each iteration of SSCA. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate inherent advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed, communication cost and model specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICC 2021</p></details> |

They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

| **[Learning Equality Constraints for Motion Planning on Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11852v1)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06311v3)** | 2020-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic execution and fuzzing are two complementary coverage-based testing techniques. How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06922v1)** | 2020-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

While the theory of these problems was thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, prior work either did not scale to industrial size instances or gave up correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. Recently, we proposed a novel approach that combines universal hashing and SAT solving and scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables without giving up correctness guarantees.

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

This is the case e.g. with strictly positive data and with compositional data, like percentages and the like. If the natural measure of difference is not the absolute one, it is possible to use simple algebraic properties to show that it is more convenient to work with a geometry that is not the usual Euclidean geometry in real space, and with a measure which is not the usual Lebesgue measure, leading to alternative models which better fit the phenomenon under study. The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for arbitrary time-point sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

To allay stress, expecting parents seek advice and share experiences in a variety of venues, from in-person birth education classes and parenting groups to virtual communities, for example, BabyCenter, a moderated online forum community with over 4 million members in the United States alone. In this study, we aim to understand how parents talk about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by analyzing 5.43M posts and comments from the April 2017--January 2024 cohort of 331,843 BabyCenter "birth club" users (that is, users who participate in due date forums or "birth clubs" based on their babies' due dates). Using BERTopic to locate breastfeeding threads and LDA to summarize themes, we compare documents in breastfeeding threads to all other birth-club content. Analyzing time series of word rank, we find that posts and comments containing anxiety-related terms increased steadily from April 2017 to January 2024. We used an ensemble of topic models to identify dominant breastfeeding topics within birth clubs, and then explored trends among all user content versus those who posted in threads related to breastfeeding topics. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify the most common topics in the full population, as well as within the subset breastfeeding population. We find that the topic of sleep dominates in content generated by the breastfeeding population, as well anxiety-related and work/daycare topics that are not predominant in the full BabyCenter birth club dataset.</p></details> |  |

Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU.

In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |

Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50% in R^2 and 12% in RMSE.

| **[Group Interventions on Deep Networks for Causal Discovery in Subsystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23906v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Access.

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Asymmetric Huber Periodogram](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25316v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel spectral M-estimator, called the asymmetric Huber periodogram (AHP), for periodicity detection in time series. The AHP is constructed from trigonometric asymmetric Huber regression, where a specially designed check function is used to substitute the squared L2 norm that defines the ordinary periodogram (PG). The AHP is statistically more efficient than the quantile periodogram (QP), while offering a more comprehensive picture than the Huber periodogram (HP) by examining the data across the entire range of the asymmetric parameter. We prove the theoretical properties of the AHP and investigate the relationship between the AHP and the so-called asymmetric Huber spectrum (AHS). Finally, simulations and three real-world data examples demonstrate that the AHP's capability in detecting periodicity and its robustness against outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving time series estimation and prediction via transfer learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25236v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many time series in the literature with high dimension yet limited sample sizes, such as macroeconomic variables, and it is almost impossible to obtain efficient estimation and accurate prediction by using the corresponding datasets themselves. This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel representation-based transfer learning framework for vector autoregressive models, and information from related source datasets with rich observations can be leveraged to enhance estimation efficiency through representation learning. A two-stage regularized estimation procedure is proposed with well established non-asymptotic properties, and algorithms with alternating updates are suggested to search for the estimates. Our transfer learning framework can handle time series with varying sample sizes and asynchronous starting and/or ending time points, thereby offering remarkable flexibility in integrating information from diverse datasets. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology, and its usefulness is demonstrated by an empirical analysis on 20 macroeconomic variables from Japan and another nine countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enlightenment Period Improving DNN Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01737v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The start of deep neural network training is characterized by a brief yet critical phase that lasts from the beginning of the training until the accuracy reaches approximately 50\%. During this phase, disordered representations rapidly transition toward ordered structure, and we term this phase the Enlightenment Period. Through theoretical modeling based on phase transition theory and experimental validation, we reveal that applying Mixup data augmentation during this phase has a dual effect: it introduces a Gradient Interference Effect that hinders performance, while also providing a beneficial Activation Revival Effect to restore gradient updates for saturated neurons. We further demonstrate that this negative interference diminishes as the sample set size or the model parameter size increases, thereby shifting the balance between these two effects. Based on these findings, we propose three strategies that improve performance by solely adjusting the training data distribution within this brief period: the Mixup Pause Strategy for small-scale scenarios, the Alpha Boost Strategy for large-scale scenarios with underfitting, and the High-Loss Removal Strategy for tasks where Mixup is inapplicable (e.g., time series and large language models). Extensive experiments show that these strategies achieve superior performance across diverse architectures such as ViT and ResNet on datasets including CIFAR and ImageNet-1K. Ultimately, this work offers a novel perspective on enhancing model performance by strategically capitalizing on the dynamics of the brief and crucial early stages of training.

Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF). However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and (2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25193v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24988v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Expressivity and Scalability with Adaptive Unitary SSMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05238v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM), a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling AUSSM to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

| **[Causal Ordering for Structure Learning From Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24639v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Training-Free Table Understanding with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v4)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Joint-Distribution Wasserstein Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24574v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.

| **[TokenTiming: A Dynamic Alignment Method for Universal Speculative Decoding Model Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15545v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |

The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the dark matter signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically; and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies, which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy, its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting repository shows superior performance over not only well-established statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series insights it generates and customizability it offers.</p></details> |  |

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Translate Human Instructions into a Reinforcement Learning Agent's Internal Emergent Symbolic Representation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24259v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further research on robust alignment between language and internal agent representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymMaP: Improving Computational Efficiency in Linear Solvers through Symbolic Preconditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24170v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of linear systems, where performance heavily depends on the selection of preconditioning parameters. Traditional parameter selection approaches often define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML) approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning (SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making it simple and reliable for deployment. Experimental results show that SymMaP consistently outperforms traditional strategies across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v7)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Without architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness: identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and +10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+ formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios. These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Symbolic Neural Generation with Applications to Lead Discovery in Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23379v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and \textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures; partial overlap of experimental results with https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.14.634875</p></details> |

| **[ENTP: Enhancing Low-Quality SFT Data via Neural-Symbolic Text Purge-Mix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23160v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP (Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction alignment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at the 10th International Workshop on Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Perception and Reasoning: Dual-Pipeline Neuro-Symbolic Landing for UAVs in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22204v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor) environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline, where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations (adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps, and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Neuro-symbolic Problem Solving: Solver-Free Learning of Constraints and Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20978v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with. Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems. Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy. Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Symbolic Integration in Large Language Models: Beyond Conventional Neurosymbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21425v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However, these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.</p></details> |  |

However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic Regression and Differentiable Fits in Beyond the Standard Model Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20453v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |
| **[LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources, and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation. However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR. These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data. Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data. As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods. We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in GECCO '24</p></details> |

For research and assessment purposes, so-called embedding models are typically employed to generate numeric representations of text that capture its semantic content for use in subsequent quantitative analyses. Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing research studies and practical applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased research findings and diminished performance of practical applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: 1) similarity-based analyses and 2) integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Overall, this study underscores the importance for educational data mining researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions.

In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data, supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks. SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.

Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> | version2 |
| **[A Unified Formal Theory on the Logical Limits of Symbol Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

This setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Apple's Find My is perhaps the most ubiquitous such system which can even locate devices which do not possess any cellular support or GPS, running on millions of devices worldwide. Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks. In this paper, we present a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties, and provide automated, machine-checkable proofs of these properties in the Tamarin prover.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Series-Symbol Data Generation for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08445v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.

| **[From Equations to Insights: Unraveling Symbolic Structures in PDEs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09986v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse fields, the application of AI to solve scientific problems, often formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs), has garnered increasing attention. While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of symbolic machine learning for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hey Pentti, We Did It Again!: Differentiable vector-symbolic types that prove polynomial termination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16533v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card, 1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000), exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020; Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hey Pentti, We Did It!: A Fully Vector-Symbolic Lisp](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17889v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kanerva (2014) suggested that it would be possible to construct a complete Lisp out of a vector-symbolic architecture. We present the general form of a vector-symbolic representation of the five Lisp elementary functions, lambda expressions, and other auxiliary functions, found in the Lisp 1.5 specification McCarthy (1960), which is near minimal and sufficient for Turing-completeness. Our specific implementation uses holographic reduced representations Plate (1995), with a lookup table cleanup memory. Lisp, as all Turing-complete languages, is a Cartesian closed category, unusual in its proximity to the mathematical abstraction. We discuss the mathematics, the purpose, and the significance of demonstrating vector-symbolic architectures' Cartesian-closure, as well as the importance of explicitly including cleanup memories in the specification of the architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATA: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Implement Autonomous and Trustworthy Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16381v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuseTok: Symbolic Music Tokenization for Generation and Semantic Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16273v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete representation learning has shown promising results across various domains, including generation and understanding in image, speech and language. Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, includes figures and tables; introduces the FinChain benchmark and ChainEval metric</p></details> |

Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23395v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13796v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the generation of realistic, handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic score generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at ICDAR workshop GREC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbol Grounding in Neuro-Symbolic AI: A Gentle Introduction to Reasoning Shortcuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14538v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.</p></details> |  |

Existing DJSCC approaches focus primarily on point-to-point wireless communication scenarios, while neglecting end-to-end communication efficiency in hybrid wireless-wired networks such as 5G and 6G communication systems. Considerable redundancy in DJSCC symbols against wireless channels becomes inefficient for long-distance wired transmission. Furthermore, DJSCC symbols must adapt to the varying transmission rate of the wired network to avoid congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed for efficient wired transmission of DJSCC symbols within hybrid wireless-wired networks, namely Rate-Controllable Wired Adaptor (RCWA). RCWA achieves redundancy-aware coding for DJSCC symbols to improve transmission efficiency, which removes considerable redundancy present in DJSCC symbols for wireless channels and encodes only source-relevant information into bits. Moreover, we leverage the Lagrangian multiplier method to achieve controllable and continuous variable-rate coding, which can encode given features into expected rates, thereby minimizing end-to-end distortion while satisfying given constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior RD performance and robustness of RCWA compared to existing baselines, validating its potential for wired resource utilization in hybrid transmission scenarios. Specifically, our method can obtain peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of up to 0.7dB and 4dB compared to neural network-based methods and digital baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn after identifying that results in Section 5 require additional re-analysis before public dissemination</p></details> |

Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://onelife-worldmodel.github.io/; 39 pages</p></details> |

This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Enhanced Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11091v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.

| **[Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logistic-Gated Operators Enable Auditable Unit-Aware Thresholds in Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05178v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness -- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, individuals with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the "digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models (LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts. Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200 semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves underprivileged populations with limited formal education.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |
| **[Discovering interpretable piecewise nonlinear model predictive control laws via symbolic decision trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10411v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose symbolic decision trees as surrogate models for approximating model predictive control laws. The proposed approach learns simultaneously the partition of the input domain (splitting logic) as well as local nonlinear expressions for predicting the control action leading to interpretable piecewise nonlinear control laws. The local nonlinear expressions are determined by the learning problem and are modeled using a set of basis functions. The learning task is posed as a mixed integer optimization, which is solved to global optimality with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers. We apply the proposed approach to a case study regarding the control of an isothermal reactor. The results show that the proposed approach can learn the control law accurately, leading to closed-loop performance comparable to that of a standard model predictive controller. Finally, comparison with existing interpretable models shows that the symbolic trees achieve both lower prediction error and superior closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proof Strategy Extraction from LLMs for Enhancing Symbolic Provers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10131v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One important approach to software verification is interactive theorem proving. However, writing formal proofs often requires substantial human effort, making proof automation highly important. Traditionally, proof automation has relied on symbolic provers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in theorem proving, complementing symbolic provers. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs can be expensive and may pose security risks for confidential codebases. As a result, purely symbolic approaches remain important even in the LLM era, as they are cost-effective, secure, and complement the strengths of LLMs. Motivated by these considerations, we ask a new research question: can we extract the internal strategies of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of symbolic provers? As an initial attempt to answer this question, we propose Strat2Rocq, which extracts proof strategies from LLMs and formalizes them as lemmas in Rocq. These lemmas are accessible to symbolic provers such as CoqHammer. With the addition of these LLM-extracted lemmas, CoqHammer is able to prove more theorems. The knowledge extraction process involves analyzing the proof trajectories of LLMs on a training set of proved theorems. For each theorem, we prompt the LLM to generate a natural language proof, then ask it to summarize this proof into formalized lemmas with proofs. We also employ a standard agentic approach to mitigate errors during formalization. Our evaluation demonstrates that, on open-source Rocq projects for software verification, Strat2Rocq enhances the success rate of CoqHammer by 13.41%.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[NL2GenSym: Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules for SOAR Cognitive Architecture via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09355v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning LLM+PDDL Symbolic Plans with Human Objective Specifications through Evolutionary Algorithm Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00300v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated planning using a symbolic planning language, such as PDDL, is a general approach to producing optimal plans to achieve a stated goal. However, creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored utilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to generate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human (LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to a set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. We account for this using an evolutionary approach to generate a population of symbolic goal specifications with slight differences from the initial translation, and utilize a trained LSTM-based validation model to assess whether each induced plan in the population adheres to the natural language specifications. We evaluate our approach on a collection of prototypical specifications in a notional naval disaster recovery task, and demonstrate that our evolutionary approach improve adherence of generated plans to natural language specifications when compared to plans generated using only LLM translations. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/owenonline/PlanCritic.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Iterated Agent for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08317v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing, RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both the C and Rust functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages to appear in Proceedings of ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic-Diffusion: Deep Learning Based Symbolic Regression with D3PM Discrete Token Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07570v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently, neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures. We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based symbolic regression.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 3 Figurees |
| **[Tempo: Compiled Dynamic Deep Learning with Symbolic Dependence Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05408v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of temporal relationships: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such dynamic dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while eager DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; graph-based systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs. We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with recurrent tensors, which include explicit temporal dimensions. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using symbolic expressions to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a symbolic dependence graph, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 24 figures, 3 bibliography pages</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06774v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive, multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods, yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement. Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06635v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws. However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN. Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery.</p></details> |  |

First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module.</p></details> | Under review |

To address this, we introduce AGENT+P, a novel framework that leverages symbolic planning to guide LLM-based UI agents. Specifically, we model an app's UI transition structure as a UI Transition Graph (UTG), which allows us to reformulate the UI automation task as a pathfinding problem on the UTG. This further enables an off-the-shelf symbolic planner to generate a provably correct and optimal high-level plan, preventing the agent from redundant exploration and guiding the agent to achieve the automation goals. AGENT+P is designed as a plug-and-play framework to enhance existing UI agents. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark demonstrates that AGENT+P improves the success rates of state-of-the-art UI agents by up to 14% and reduces the action steps by 37.7%.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages double column; two figures</p></details> |

We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.</p></details> |  |

Exploring How Humans and AI Interact with Symbols and Meanings in Their Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05378v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction, AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation. Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols, suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.</p></details> | CHI 2026 Papers |

Investigating Memorization, Emergence, and Symbolic Processing in In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11004v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more informed guidelines.</p></details> | TMLR |
| **[Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning remains a core challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LLMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. Conceptually, SymPlanner operationalizes two cognitive faculties: (i) error monitoring and repair via externalized feedback (IC) and (ii) preference formation among alternatives via pairwise comparison (CR), advancing cognitively plausible, symbol-grounded planning aligned with the rich structure in intelligent systems. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Twelfth Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems</p></details> |

The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-interactive reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, Symbolic-Aided CoT preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning tasks and scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 39th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 39)</p></details> |
| **[Symbol Timing Synchronization and Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02981v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ambient Internet of Things (AIoT) devices to achieve ultra-low-power, low-cost, and massive connectivity. Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR. Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates the BER performance degradation caused by STO.</p></details> |  |

The PISR framework combines symbolic regression with physics-based constraints, boundary conditions, and available simulation data to guide the search for solutions.

| **[NeSyGeo: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Multimodal Geometric Reasoning Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17121v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining large-scale, high-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined tem plates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-attributes-relations paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to visual and textual representations and generates reasoning path with reverse search and forward validation. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.s</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[An Algorithmic Information-Theoretic Perspective on the Symbol Grounding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05153v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT). We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian (self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second, we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own. This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 table (in appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking Symbol-Level Precoding Efficiency Through Tensor Equivariant Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02108v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI) exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP) and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately 80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[OntoURL: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Symbolic Ontological Understanding, Reasoning and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11031v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in handling ontologies -- formal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in LLMS via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.</p></details> |  |

Two major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency, preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline, SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time. Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation, SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to 6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal specifications.

| **[Neuro-Symbolic AI for Analytical Solutions of Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01476v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analytical solutions of differential equations offer exact insights into fundamental behaviors of physical processes. Their application, however, is limited as finding these solutions is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we combine two key insights. First, constructing an analytical solution requires a composition of foundational solution components. Second, iterative solvers define parameterized function spaces with constraint-based updates. Our approach merges compositional differential equation solution techniques with iterative refinement by using formal grammars, building a rich space of candidate solutions that are embedded into a low-dimensional (continuous) latent manifold for probabilistic exploration. This integration unifies numerical and symbolic differential equation solvers via a neuro-symbolic AI framework to find analytical solutions of a wide variety of differential equations. By systematically constructing candidate expressions and applying constraint-based refinement, we overcome longstanding barriers to extract such closed-form solutions. We illustrate advantages over commercial solvers, symbolic methods, and approximate neural networks on a diverse set of problems, demonstrating both generality and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic and High-Accuracy Solutions to Differential and Integral Problems via a Novel Recursive Inverse Laplace Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00719v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-analytical method for solving a broad class of initial value problems involving differential, integro-differential, and delay equations, including those with fractional and variable-order derivatives. The proposed approach is based on the inverse Laplace transform, applied initially - unlike traditional Laplace-based techniques which begin with a forward transformation. By assuming the unknown solution is the Laplace transform of an auxiliary function, the method reformulates the problem in the time domain and recursively solves for this function using symbolic operations. The final solution is then obtained by applying the Laplace transform to the result. This strategy enables the construction of symbolic solutions as generalized logarithmic-power series with arbitrary accuracy, and naturally accommodates complex terms. The method is highly versatile and demonstrates superior speed and precision across a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems, including singular, fractional, and chaotic systems. Several benchmark examples are provided to validate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed technique compared to classical numerical methods. The results confirm that the new method offers a powerful and flexible framework for symbolic computation of initial value problems.</p></details> |  |

Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing compositional reasoning across vision and symbols.

Our approach generates counterfactual explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically coherent.

While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements.

Evaluating Interventions for Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15584v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust. Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with 400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making wrong reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance interventions in human-LLM collaboration.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables.

Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25369v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that neither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of arbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce grounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation for formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive definitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e., "bottom") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing" terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar classical rules. A mechanically-checked consistency proof in Isabelle/HOL exists for the basic quantifier-free fragment of GA. Quantifiers may be added atop this foundation as ordinary computations, whose inference rules are thus admissible and do not introduce new inconsistency risks. While GA is only a first step towards richly-typed grounded deduction practical for everyday use in manual or automated computational reasoning, it shows the promise that the expressive freedom of arbitrary recursive definition can in principle be incorporated into formal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[p-less Sampling: A Robust Hyperparameter-Free Approach for LLM Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23234v4)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/ryttry/p-less .</p></details> |  |
| **[From Memorization to Reasoning in the Spectrum of Loss Curvature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |

While many works have largely assumed well-defined tasks, real-world queries are often underspecified and only solvable by acquiring missing information. We formalize this information-gathering problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with partially-observed initial states, (3) GSM-Q: human-annotated grade school math problems with one unknown variable, and (4) GSME-Q: equation-based version of GSM-Q. The LLM must select the correct clarification question from multiple options. While current models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, they achieve only 40-50% accuracy on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis shows that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems is not sufficient for success on our benchmark: models struggle to identify the right question even when they can solve the fully specified version.

| **[RETuning: Upgrading Inference-Time Scaling for Stock Movement Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21604v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks, with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.</p></details> |  |

Using the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) and its open-source implementation, PyETR, we programmatically generate 383 formally specified reasoning problems and evaluate 38 models. For each response, we judge logical correctness and, when incorrect, whether it matches an ETR-predicted fallacy. Two results stand out: (i) as a capability proxy (Chatbot Arena Elo) increases, a larger share of a model's incorrect answers are ETR-predicted fallacies $(\rho=0.360, p=0.0265)$, while overall correctness on this dataset shows no correlation with capability; (ii) reversing premise order significantly reduces fallacy production for many models, mirroring human order effects. Methodologically, PyETR provides an open-source pipeline for unbounded, synthetic, contamination-resistant reasoning tests linked to a cognitive theory, enabling analyses that focus on error composition rather than error rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightPlanner: Unleashing the Reasoning Capabilities of Lightweight Large Language Models in Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08508v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full research paper at K-CAP 2025</p></details> |

Existing recurrent state-space model (RSSM)-based world models depend on single-step statistical inference to capture the environment dynamics, and, hence, they are unable to perform long-term imagination tasks due to the accumulation of prediction errors. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose a novel dual-mind world model (DMWM) framework that integrates logical reasoning to enable imagination with logical consistency. DMWM is composed of two components: an RSSM-based System 1 (RSSM-S1) component that handles state transitions in an intuitive manner and a logic-integrated neural network-based System 2 (LINN-S2) component that guides the imagination process through hierarchical deep logical reasoning. The inter-system feedback mechanism is designed to ensure that the imagination process follows the logical rules of the real environment. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark tasks that require long-term planning from the DMControl suite. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields significant improvements in terms of logical coherence, trial efficiency, data efficiency and long-term imagination over the state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CreativityPrism: A Holistic Benchmark for Large Language Model Creativity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20091v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text, there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e., divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other - whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast, approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (20 pages, 10 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/simko/)</p></details> |
| **[ActivationReasoning: Logical Reasoning in Latent Activation Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18184v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA), and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and auditable AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Attention Modulation: Towards Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17705v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |
| **[StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17238v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this repository.}</p></details> |  |
| **[System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models Beyond User Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Multi-Path Plan Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11620v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model (LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are LLMs Stable Formal Logic Translators in Logical Reasoning Across Linguistically Diversified Texts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LinguDiver.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this organization, we propose Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo): a modular, transformer-based architecture post-trained with a curriculum that induces functional specialization across experts. Concretely, we partition the layers of a pretrained language model into four expert modules aligned with well-studied cognitive networks in the human brain. MiCRo offers three key advantages over standard language models. (1) The specialized experts are interpretable and causally meaningful -- ablating a module causes substantial drops on benchmarks requiring its specialized domain. (2) MiCRo's behavior can be dynamically steered at inference time by routing tokens to particular experts (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over outputs. (3) MiCRo outperforms or matches comparable baselines on both machine-learning reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, BBH) and alignment to human behavior (CogBench), while maintaining interpretability. Taken together, cognitively grounded functional specialization yields models that are both more human-like and more human-interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, whether they can flexibly apply appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization. Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning. Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.

Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture, where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate (logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge, demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly, aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO, where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more advanced and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing benchmarks are limited to English, creating a significant gap for low-resource languages. For example, Bangla is spoken by nearly 250 million people who would collectively benefit from LLMs capable of native fluency. To address this, we present BanglaMATH, a dataset of 1.7k Bangla math word problems across topics such as Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Logical Reasoning, sourced from Bangla elementary school workbooks and annotated with details like grade level and number of reasoning steps. We have designed BanglaMATH to evaluate the mathematical capabilities of both commercial and open-source LLMs in Bangla, and we find that Gemini 2.5 Flash and DeepSeek V3 are the only models to achieve strong performance, with $\ge$ 80\% accuracy across three elementary school grades. Furthermore, we assess the robustness and language bias of these top-performing LLMs by augmenting the original problems with distracting information, and translating the problems into English. We show that both LLMs fail to maintain robustness and exhibit significant performance bias in Bangla. Our study underlines current limitations of LLMs in handling arithmetic and mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages, and highlights the need for further research on multilingual and equitable mathematical understanding.

| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g., arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation & Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3) Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated reasoning skills.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extended Triangular Method: A Generalized Algorithm for Contradiction Separation Based Automated Deduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10701v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning. Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018, proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.</p></details> | 38 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DUMP: Automated Distribution-Level Curriculum Learning for RL-based LLM Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09710v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

| **[CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09472v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that a small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the logical inference required by the task.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce LaV-CoT, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment.

Several approaches have been proposed to apply LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[SOP-Maze: Evaluating Large Language Models on Complicated Business Standard Operating Procedures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08942v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures; (ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions. Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |

Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level probing. Leveraging this framework, we conduct a comprehensive study on how different supervision formats in fine-tuning shape reasoning abilities. We fine-tune LLMs on four supervision styles: one in natural language and three symbolic variants. We find a key trade-off: natural language supervision excels at generalization to out-of-distribution and long-chain problems, whereas symbolic supervision is superior at instilling structurally sound, atomic reasoning steps. Furthermore, our probing analysis indicates that fine-tuning primarily refines the model's step-by-step generation process, rather than improving its ability to converge on an answer early. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/FineLogic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL, it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically grounded method for trustworthy AI.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |

Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et. al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation.

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the real-world tasks in the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. Each task requires a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates, respectively. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80,000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution, through which a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models. Finally, we provide an in-depth failure analysis to understand the limitations of different models. We will publicly release the benchmark for future research on program synthesis in visual programming.</p></details> | ACL'25 paper |

To better understand how humans might collaborate effectively with AI, we evaluate the performance of crowd workers on these individual reasoning subtasks. We find that while humans excel at knowledge integration (97\% accuracy), they often fail to recognize when a question requires multi-hop reasoning (67\% accuracy). Participants perform reasonably well on both single-hop and multi-hop QA (84\% and 80\% accuracy, respectively), but frequently make semantic mistakes--for example, answering "when" an event happened when the question asked "where." These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that complement human strengths while compensating for common weaknesses.</p></details> |  |

However, these benchmarks tend to become easier over time as LLMs can learn from the published benchmarks. This limitation hinder the precise evaluation of the true capabilities of SOTA models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. Experimental results demonstrate that EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model accuracy by an average of 48\%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving these evolved problems, LLMs tend to bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning by relying on simplistic and fuzzy conditions, consequently leading to incorrect solutions. We define this phenomenon as the ``Pseudo Aha Moment", which we find accounts for 77\% to 100\% of errors on targeted problems.

By incorporating these symbolic structures, Symbolic-Aided CoT preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning tasks and scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules.

| **[Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Gala, a framework that addresses this challenge with a global agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Has the Two-Decade-Old Prophecy Come True? Artificial Bad Intelligence Triggered by Merely a Single-Bit Flip in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00490v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) has garnered widespread attention for its ability to compromise software system integrity remotely through hardware fault injection. With the widespread distillation and deployment of large language models (LLMs) into single file .gguf formats, their weight spaces have become exposed to an unprecedented hardware attack surface. This paper is the first to systematically discover and validate the existence of single-bit vulnerabilities in LLM weight files: in mainstream open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek and QWEN) using .gguf quantized formats, flipping just single bit can induce three types of targeted semantic level failures Artificial Flawed Intelligence (outputting factual errors), Artificial Weak Intelligence (degradation of logical reasoning capability), and Artificial Bad Intelligence (generating harmful content). By building an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and a probabilistic heuristic scanning framework called BitSifter, we achieved efficient localization of critical vulnerable bits in models with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments show that vulnerabilities are significantly concentrated in the tensor data region, particularly in areas related to the attention mechanism and output layers, which are the most sensitive. A negative correlation was observed between model size and robustness, with smaller models being more susceptible to attacks. Furthermore, a remote BFA chain was designed, enabling semantic-level attacks in real-world environments: At an attack frequency of 464.3 times per second, a single bit can be flipped with 100% success in as little as 31.7 seconds. This causes the accuracy of LLM to plummet from 73.5% to 0%, without requiring high-cost equipment or complex prompt engineering.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://llm-symbol.github.io/Aristotle/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24765v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL), while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94) and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05% average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Rectification Sampling for Test-Time Compute Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01317v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chains of thought (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicates that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[OIG-Bench: A Multi-Agent Annotated Benchmark for Multimodal One-Image Guides Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00069v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%. Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science.

| **[SCI-Verifier: Scientific Verifier with Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24285v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper focuses on LLM-as-a-Judge, and the project is currently in progress</p></details> |

Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation. We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).</p></details> | preprint |
| **[DEL-ToM: Inference-Time Scaling for Theory-of-Mind Reasoning via Dynamic Epistemic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17348v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack the capability for dynamic logical reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves verifiable ToM reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and verifiable dynamic logical reasoning. We use data generated automatically via a DEL simulator to train a verifier, which we call the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each belief update step. During inference, the PBM evaluates candidate belief traces from the LLM and selects the highest-scoring one. This allows LLMs to allocate extra inference-time compute to yield more transparent reasoning. Experiments across model scales and benchmarks show that DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief supervision significantly enhances LLMs' ToM capabilities without retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/joel-wu/DEL-ToM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Chain of Thought Enables Parallel Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23648v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work provides new theoretical guarantees and algorithms for CoT2, motivated by logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities. Theoretically, we establish how CoT2 facilitates the model to track multiple discrete traces in parallel; and quantify the level of achievable parallelism and its benefits for inference efficiency. We also provide a CoT2-based one-layer transformer construction that solves the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given a sufficient embedding dimension. These insights arise from a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the language model outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization methods for CoT2. Our primary strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism. Experiments confirm that (i) the optimal level of parallelism is governed by the embedding dimension, (ii) our continuous supervision strategy can outperform alternative methods, and (iii) policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason in Structured In-context Environments with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23330v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability. However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment (SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment, leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm, particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT) and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$ of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks. Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Socially via Cognitive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22546v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs. CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/thu-coai/CogFlow</p></details> |

Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025.

A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second, an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the crucial dimension of explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can GRPO Boost Complex Multimodal Table Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16889v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.

The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework.

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach that involves a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive solution for audio logical reasoning (ALR) tasks: we introduce SoundMind, a dataset of 6,446 audio-text annotated samples specifically curated to support complex reasoning. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to equip audio-language models with robust audio-text reasoning capabilities. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the proposed SoundMind dataset using SoundMind-RL, we achieve strong and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SoundMind benchmark. This work highlights the benefit of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, and contributes to advancing auditory intelligence in language models.

While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption across and within different collaborative and social contexts. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Clari...</summary><p>Clarify the contextual positioning of our framework in relation to prior XAI design work and expand the review details</p></details> |

Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer.</p></details> |  |

The data format, named cognitive-logs, enables rigour and flexible logical reasoning. Cognitive-logs consist of a set of relational and graph databases. Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of "actions" represented by verbs in natural languages and "participants" who perform the actions. These objects are connected by arrows (morphisms) that bind each action to its participant and bind causes and effects. The design principle of cognitive-logs refers cognitive sciences especially in cognitive linguistics. Logical reasoning is the processes of comparing causal chains in episodic memories with known rules which are also recorded in the cognitive-logs. Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories. The goal of this study is to develop a database-driven artificial intelligence that thinks like a human but possesses the accuracy and rigour of a machine. The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences. Cognitive-logs also serve as a model of human cognition mind activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71. The code has been released at: https://github.com/tangpan360/MicroRCA-Agent.</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main), 9+6 pages</p></details> |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages |

We measured the accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June 2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025. We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15 billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3, an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted as a main track paper for publication in the proceedings of the Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025 held in Canberra, Australia</p></details> |

However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[NIRS: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies as alternatives to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal is to develop NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences. Results: The ontology has 129 classes, 11 object properties, and 17 data properties across 886 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 361 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes: for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation. Conclusion: We developed an ontology that captures NIRS modalities in a unified framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies, which may need to be expanded to encompass a broader scope.</p></details> |  |

Using data from U.S. presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall, basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy classification in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side. The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reasoning Quality in Large Language Models through Enhanced Chain-of-Thought via RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06024v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer. Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.</p></details> |  |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings. 23 pages, 23 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Sensitivity and Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language (NL) statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text, often go unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based metrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding ground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of FOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator and text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric sensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics against LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation affects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL metric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between BertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
