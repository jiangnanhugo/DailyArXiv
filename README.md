| **[Asymmetric Number Partitioning with Splitting and Interval Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11753v7)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The n-way number partitioning problem, a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, has significant implications for applications such as fair division and machine scheduling. Despite these problems being NP-hard, many approximation techniques exist. We consider three closely related kinds of approximations, and various objectives such as decision, min-max, max-min, and even a generalized objective, in which the bins are not considered identical anymore, but rather asymmetric (used to solve fair division to asymmetric agents or uniform machine scheduling problems). The first two variants optimize the partition such that: in the first variant some fixed number s of items can be split between two or more bins and in the second variant we allow at most a fixed number t of splittings. The third variant is a decision problem: the largest bin sum must be within a pre-specified interval, parameterized by a fixed rational number u times the largest item size. When the number of bins n is unbounded, we show that every variant is strongly NP-complete. When the number of bins n is fixed, the running time depends on the fixed parameters s,t,u. For each variant, we give a complete picture of its running time. For n=2, the running time is easy to identify. Our main results consider any fixed n>=3. Using a two-way polynomial-time reduction between the first and the third variant, we show that n-way number-partitioning with s split items can be solved in polynomial time if s>=n-2, and it is NP-complete otherwise. Also, n-way number-partitioning with t splittings can be solved in polynomial time if t>=n-1, and it is NP-complete otherwise. Finally, we show that the third variant can be solved in polynomial time if u>=(n-2)/n, and it is NP-complete otherwise. Our positive results for the optimization problems consider both asymmetric min-max and asymmetric max-min versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Training of Multi-task Neural Solver for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06361v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently training a multi-task neural solver for various combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) has been less studied so far. Naive application of conventional multi-task learning approaches often falls short in delivering a high-quality, unified neural solver. This deficiency primarily stems from the significant computational demands and a lack of adequate consideration for the complexities inherent in COPs. In this paper, we propose a general and efficient training paradigm to deliver a unified combinatorial multi-task neural solver. To this end, we resort to the theoretical loss decomposition for multiple tasks under an encoder-decoder framework, which enables more efficient training via proper bandit task-sampling algorithms through an intra-task influence matrix. By employing theoretically grounded approximations, our method significantly enhances overall performance, regardless of whether it is within constrained training budgets, across equivalent training epochs, or in terms of generalization capabilities, when compared to conventional training schedules. On the real-world datasets of TSPLib and CVRPLib, our method also achieved the best results compared to single task learning and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, the influence matrix provides empirical evidence supporting common practices in the field of learning to optimize, further substantiating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/LOGO-CUHKSZ/MTL-COP.</p></details> | Accepted by TMLR |
| **[QPanda3: A High-Performance Software-Hardware Collaborative Framework for Large-Scale Quantum-Classical Computing Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02455v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>QPanda3 is a high-performance quantum programming framework that enhances quantum computing efficiency through optimized circuit compilation, an advanced instruction stream format (OriginBIS), and hardware-aware execution strategies. These engineering optimizations significantly improve both processing speed and system performance, addressing key challenges in the NISQ era. A core innovation, OriginBIS, accelerates encoding speeds by up to 86.9x compared to OpenQASM 2.0, while decoding is 35.6x faster, leading to more efficient data handling, reduced memory overhead, and improved communication efficiency. This directly enhances the execution of quantum circuits, making large-scale quantum simulations more feasible. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates QPanda3's superior performance: quantum circuit construction is 20.7x faster, execution speeds improve by 3.4x, and transpilation efficiency increases by 14.97x over Qiskit. Notably, in compiling a 118-qubit W-state circuit on a 2D-grid topology, QPanda3 achieves an unprecedented 869.9x speedup, underscoring its ability to handle complex quantum workloads at scale. By combining high-speed quantum processing with a modular and extensible software architecture, QPanda3 provides a practical bridge between today's NISQ devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. It facilitates real-world applications in financial modeling, materials science, and combinatorial optimization, while its robust and scalable design supports industrial adoption and cloud-based deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning-assisted High-speed Combinatorial Optimization with Ising Machines for Dynamically Changing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23966v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum or quantum-inspired Ising machines have recently shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems in a short time. Real-world applications, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks and financial trading, require solving those problems sequentially where the size and characteristics change dynamically. However, using Ising machines involves challenges to shorten system-wide latency due to the transfer of large Ising model or the cloud access and to determine the parameters for each problem. Here we show a combinatorial optimization method using embedded Ising machines, which enables solving diverse problems at high speed without runtime parameter tuning. We customize the algorithm and circuit architecture of the simulated bifurcation-based Ising machine to compress the Ising model and accelerate computation and then built a machine learning model to estimate appropriate parameters using extensive training data. In TDMA scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks, our demonstration has shown that the sophisticated system can adapt to changes in the problem and showed that it has a speed advantage over conventional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Computation Algorithms for Knapsack: impossibility results, and how to avoid them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01543v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local Computation Algorithms (LCA), as introduced by Rubinfeld, Tamir, Vardi, and Xie (2011), are a type of ultra-efficient algorithms which, given access to a (large) input for a given computational task, are required to provide fast query access to a consistent output solution, without maintaining a state between queries. This paradigm of computation in particular allows for hugely distributed algorithms, where independent instances of a given LCA provide consistent access to a common output solution. The past decade has seen a significant amount of work on LCAs, by and large focusing on graph problems. In this paper, we initiate the study of Local Computation Algorithms for perhaps the archetypal combinatorial optimization problem, Knapsack. We first establish strong impossibility results, ruling out the existence of any non-trivial LCA for Knapsack as several of its relaxations. We then show how equipping the LCA with additional access to the Knapsack instance, namely, weighted item sampling, allows one to circumvent these impossibility results, and obtain sublinear-time and query LCAs. Our positive result draws on a connection to the recent notion of reproducibility for learning algorithms (Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell, 2022), a connection we believe to be of independent interest for the design of LCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Oscillator-Based Ising Machine Models with Amplitude Dynamics and Polynomial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00329v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an oscillator model with both phase and amplitude dynamics for oscillator-based Ising machines that addresses combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order. Our approach addresses fundamental limitations of previous oscillator-based Ising machines through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance. This work strengthens both the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of oscillator-based Ising machines for complex optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deriving Representative Structure from Music Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15849v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Coupled Input-Output Dimension Reduction: Application to Goal-oriented Bayesian Experimental Design and Global Sensitivity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13425v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol' indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Combinatorial Pricing Problems using Embedded Dynamic Programming Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12923v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combinatorial pricing problem (CPP) is a bilevel problem in which the leader maximizes their revenue by imposing tolls on certain items that they can control. Based on the tolls set by the leader, the follower selects a subset of items corresponding to an optimal solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. To accomplish the leader's goal, the tolls need to be sufficiently low to discourage the follower from choosing the items offered by the competitors. In this paper, we derive a single-level reformulation for the CPP by rewriting the follower's problem as a longest path problem using a dynamic programming model, and then taking its dual and applying strong duality. We proceed to solve the reformulation in a dynamic fashion with a cutting plane method. We apply this methodology to two distinct dynamic programming models, namely, a novel formulation designated as selection diagram and the well-known decision diagram. We also produce numerical results to evaluate their performances across three different specializations of the CPP and a closely related problem that is the knapsack interdiction problem. Our results showcase the potential of the two proposed reformulations over the natural value function approach, expanding the set of tools to solve combinatorial bilevel programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Starjob: Dataset for LLM-Driven Job Shop Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01877v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, but their potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization that requires efficient job allocation to machines to minimize makespan. To this end, we introduce Starjob, the first supervised dataset for JSSP, comprising 130k instances specifically designed for training LLMs. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune the LLaMA 8B 4-bit quantized model with the LoRA method to develop an end-to-end scheduling approach. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based method not only surpasses traditional Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) but also achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art neural approaches like L2D, with an average improvement of 15.36% on DMU and 7.85% on Taillard benchmarks. These results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.06993</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(2^{n/2}\bigr)$, still the best-known deterministic bound. Yet many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so actual hardness often depends on the number of unique sums ($U$). We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only distinct sums, pruning duplicates on the fly, thus running in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(U)$ when $U \ll 2^n$. Its core is a unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy and lightweight dynamic programming, avoiding the classical MIM's expensive merge. We also introduce combinatorial tree compression to guarantee strictly sub-$2^{n/2}$ enumeration even on unstructured inputs, shaving a nontrivial constant from the exponent. Our solver supports anytime and online modes, producing partial solutions early and adapting to newly added elements. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that for structured instances -- e.g. with small doubling constants, high additive energy, or significant redundancy -- our method can far outperform classical approaches, often nearing dynamic-programming efficiency. Even in the worst case, it remains within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(2^{n/2}\bigr)$, and its compression-based pruning yields a real constant-factor speedup over naive MIM. We conclude by discussing how this instance-specific adaptivity refines the Subset Sum complexity landscape and suggesting future adaptive-exponential directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, preliminary, extended version</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Learning for Quadratic Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20001v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PLUME search, a data-driven framework that enhances search efficiency in combinatorial optimization through unsupervised learning. Unlike supervised or reinforcement learning, PLUME search learns directly from problem instances using a permutation-based loss with a non-autoregressive approach. We evaluate its performance on the quadratic assignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard problem that encompasses various combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Linear, nested, and quadratic ordered measures: Computation and incorporation into optimization problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18097v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we address a unified mathematical optimization framework to compute a wide range of measures used in most operations research and data science contexts. The goal is to embed such metrics within general optimization models allowing their efficient computation. We assess the usefulness of this approach applying it to three different families of measures, namely linear, nested, and quadratic ordered measures. Computational results are reported showing the efficiency and accuracy of our methods as compared with standard implementations in numerical software packages. Finally, we illustrate this methodology by computing a number of optimal solutions with respect to different metrics on three well-known linear and combinatorial optimization problems: scenario analysis in linear programming, the traveling salesman and the weighted multicover set problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOPO: Neural Combinatorial Optimization via Best-anchored and Objective-guided Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07580v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising approach for NP-hard problems. However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Preference Optimization for Combinatorial Optimization (POCO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) an efficient preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) a novel loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-Shop Scheduling (JSP), Traveling Salesman (TSP), and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (FJSP) show POCO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. POCO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputing Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20212v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems by providing quantum speedup on near-term gate-based quantum computing systems. However, QAOA faces challenges for high-dimensional problems due to the large number of qubits required and the complexity of deep circuits, limiting its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we present a distributed QAOA (DQAOA), which leverages distributed computing strategies to decompose a large computational workload into smaller tasks that require fewer qubits and shallower circuits than necessitated to solve the original problem. These sub-problems are processed using a combination of high-performance and quantum computing resources. The global solution is iteratively updated by aggregating sub-solutions, allowing convergence toward the optimal solution. We demonstrate that DQAOA can handle considerably large-scale optimization problems (e.g., 1,000-bit problem) achieving a high approximation ratio ($\sim$99%) and short time-to-solution ($\sim$276 s), outperforming existing strategies. Furthermore, we realize DQAOA on a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, paving the way for practical applications of gate-based quantum computers in real-world optimization tasks. To extend DQAOA's applicability to materials science, we further develop an active learning algorithm integrated with our DQAOA (AL-DQAOA), which involves machine learning, DQAOA, and active data production in an iterative loop. We successfully optimize photonic structures using AL-DQAOA, indicating that solving real-world optimization problems using gate-based quantum computing is feasible. We expect the proposed DQAOA to be applicable to a wide range of optimization problems and AL-DQAOA to find broader applications in material design.</p></details> |  |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing variational quantum algorithms by balancing training on classical and quantum hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16361v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to provide a near-term route to quantum utility or advantage, and is usually constructed by using parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in combination with a classical optimizer for training. Although VQAs have been proposed for a multitude of tasks such as ground-state estimation, combinatorial optimization and unitary compilation, there remain major challenges in its trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra Supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training schemes that combine an existing g-sim method (that uses the underlying group structure of the operators) and the Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically test our proposal for ground-state estimation using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and classification of quantum phases using quantum neural networks. Our methods show better accuracy and success of trials, and also need fewer calls to the quantum hardware on an average than using only PSR (upto 60% reduction), that runs exclusively on quantum hardware. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 4 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Real-World Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16159v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are a class of NP-hard problems ubiquitous in several real-world logistics scenarios that pose significant challenges for optimization. Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical approaches, as it can learn fast heuristics to solve VRPs. However, most research works in NCO for VRPs focus on simplified settings, which do not account for asymmetric distances and travel durations that cannot be derived by simple Euclidean distances and unrealistic data distributions, hindering real-world deployment. This work introduces RRNCO (Real Routing NCO) to bridge the gap of NCO between synthetic and real-world VRPs in the critical aspects of both data and modeling. First, we introduce a new, openly available dataset with real-world data containing a diverse dataset of locations, distances, and duration matrices from 100 cities, considering realistic settings with actual routing distances and durations obtained from Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). Second, we propose a novel approach that efficiently processes both node and edge features through contextual gating, enabling the construction of more informed node embedding, and we finally incorporate an Adaptation Attention Free Module (AAFM) with neural adaptive bias mechanisms that effectively integrates not only distance matrices but also angular relationships between nodes, allowing our model to capture rich structural information. RRNCO achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world VRPs among NCO methods. We make our dataset and code publicly available at https://github.com/ai4co/real-routing-nco.</p></details> |  |

We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[FusDreamer: Label-efficient Remote Sensing World Model for Multimodal Data Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13814v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models significantly enhance hierarchical understanding, improving data integration and learning efficiency. To explore the potential of the world model in the remote sensing (RS) field, this paper proposes a label-efficient remote sensing world model for multimodal data fusion (FusDreamer). The FusDreamer uses the world model as a unified representation container to abstract common and high-level knowledge, promoting interactions across different types of data, \emph{i.e.}, hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and text data. Initially, a new latent diffusion fusion and multimodal generation paradigm (LaMG) is utilized for its exceptional information integration and detail retention capabilities. Subsequently, an open-world knowledge-guided consistency projection (OK-CP) module incorporates prompt representations for visually described objects and aligns language-visual features through contrastive learning. In this way, the domain gap can be bridged by fine-tuning the pre-trained world models with limited samples. Finally, an end-to-end multitask combinatorial optimization (MuCO) strategy can capture slight feature bias and constrain the diffusion process in a collaboratively learnable direction. Experiments conducted on four typical datasets indicate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed FusDreamer. The corresponding code will be released at https://github.com/Cimy-wang/FusDreamer.</p></details> |  |

We propose to extend this powerful combination to the control of dynamical systems, generating interpretable control policies capable of complex behaviors. With our novel method, we represent control policies as programs in standard languages like Python. We evaluate candidate controllers in simulation and evolve them using a pre-trained LLM. Unlike conventional learning-based control techniques, which rely on black-box neural networks to encode control policies, our approach enhances transparency and interpretability. We still take advantage of the power of large AI models, but only at the policy design phase, ensuring that all system components remain interpretable and easily verifiable at runtime. Additionally, the use of standard programming languages makes it straightforward for humans to finetune or adapt the controllers based on their expertise and intuition. We illustrate our method through its application to the synthesis of an interpretable control policy for the pendulum swing-up and the ball in cup tasks. We make the code available at https://github.com/muellerlab/synthesizing_interpretable_control_policies.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Regulators favour conservative approaches for robust type I error control, though excessive conservatism may significantly reduce statistical power. We offer fundamental theoretical contributions that extend an approach proposed in 1969, resulting in the derivation of a family of exact tests designed to maximize a specific type of power. We establish theoretical guarantees for controlling type I error despite the discretization of the null parameter space. This theoretical advancement is supported by a comprehensive series of experiments to empirically quantify the power advantages compared to traditional hypothesis tests. The approach determines the rejection region through a binary decision for each outcome dataset and uses integer programming to find an optimal decision boundary that maximizes power subject to type I error constraints. Our analysis provides new theoretical properties and insights into this approach's comparative advantages. When optimized for average power over all possible parameter configurations under the alternative, the method exhibits remarkable robustness, performing optimally or near-optimally across specific alternatives while maintaining exact type I error control. The method can be further customized for particular prior beliefs by using a weighted average. The findings highlight both the method's practical utility and how techniques from combinatorial optimization can enhance statistical methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Robustness of LLM-based NLP Software via Automated Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21016v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development. Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation. Unlike traditional software, LLM-based NLP software relies on prompts and examples as inputs. Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs, quantitatively assessing the robustness of such software is crucial. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated robustness testing methods have been specifically designed to evaluate the overall inputs of LLM-based NLP software. To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem. Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search. ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking. We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models. ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%. Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p></details> |  |

Even for systems of linear equations that are highly sparse, their direct solution via factorization methods, such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, is computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on the variational quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm (VarQITE), allowing to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of reordering of sparse matrices to minimize the fill-in. We develop a hybrid quantum/classical pipeline to accelerate Finite Element solvers by integrating the VarQITE algorithm into the production workflow of Ansys' industrial software LS-DYNA. This allows to study multiple different types of FEA problems, ranging from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics. We prove out that VarQITE positively impacts LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems when compared against the classical heuristic graph partitioning solver in LS-DYNA. The selected instances cover a range of FEA problems, including simulation of blood pumps, roof crushing of cars, and vibration analysis of cars. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum-accelerated workflow on FEA meshes of up to 5.9M vertices and 55 million edges. We find that the wall clock time of the heuristics solutions used in the industry-grade solver is improved by up to 12\%. We also execute the VarQITE algorithm on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte) and find that the results are comparable to noiseless and noisy simulations. Finally, we introduce a hybrid technique for post-processing the found solutions with classical refinement heuristics such as Fiduccia-Mattheyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[HETRI: Heterogeneous Ising Multiprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23517v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising machines are effective solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems. The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial optimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which naturally converges to a minimum energy state upon perturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, can capture the dynamic behavior of different physical systems by mapping each problem variable to a spin which can interact with other spins. Ising model as a mathematical abstraction can be mapped to hardware using traditional devices. In this paper we instead focus on Ising machines which represent a network of physical spins directly implemented in hardware using, e.g., quantum bits or electronic oscillators. To eliminate the scalability bottleneck due to the mismatch in problem vs. Ising machine size and connectivity, in this paper we make the case for HETRI: Heterogeneous Ising Multiprocessing. HETRI organizes the maximum number of physical spins that the underlying technology supports in Ising cores; and multiple independent Ising cores, in Ising chips. Ising cores in a chip feature different inter-spin connectivity or spin counts to match the problem characteristics. We provide a detailed design space exploration and quantify the performance in terms of time or energy to solution and solution accuracy with respect to homogeneous alternatives under the very same hardware budget and considering the very same spin technology.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this goal necessitates optimizing operational decision-making to efficiently manage ambulances. Against this background, we study a centrally controlled EMS system for which we learn an online ambulance dispatching and redeployment policy that aims at minimizing the mean response time of ambulances within the system by dispatching an ambulance upon receiving an emergency call and redeploying it to a waiting location upon the completion of its service. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization-augmented machine learning pipeline that allows to learn efficient policies for ambulance dispatching and redeployment. In this context, we further show how to solve the underlying full-information problem to generate training data and propose an augmentation scheme that improves our pipeline's generalization performance by mitigating a possible distribution mismatch with respect to the considered state space. Compared to existing methods that rely on augmentation during training, our approach offers substantial runtime savings of up to 87.9% while yielding competitive performance. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline against current industry practices, we conduct a numerical case study on the example of San Francisco's 911 call data. Results show that the learned policies outperform the online benchmarks across various resource and demand scenarios, yielding a reduction in mean response time of up to 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Elicitation for Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization with Active Learning and Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11435v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life combinatorial optimization problems often involve several conflicting objectives, such as price, product quality and sustainability. A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

While a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, doing computation apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems. In this paper, we provide an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view.

This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combinatorial Optimization via LLM-driven Iterated Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06917v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel way to integrate flexible, context-dependent constraints into combinatorial optimization by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside traditional algorithms. Although LLMs excel at interpreting nuanced, locally specified requirements, they struggle with enforcing global combinatorial feasibility. To bridge this gap, we propose an iterated fine-tuning framework where algorithmic feedback progressively refines the LLM's output distribution. Interpreting this as simulated annealing, we introduce a formal model based on a "coarse learnability" assumption, providing sample complexity bounds for convergence. Empirical evaluations on scheduling, graph connectivity, and clustering tasks demonstrate that our framework balances the flexibility of locally expressed constraints with rigorous global optimization more effectively compared to baseline sampling methods. Our results highlight a promising direction for hybrid AI-driven combinatorial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Constraint-Based Adaptive Hypergraph Learning for Solving Vehicle Routing: An End-to-End Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10421v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of learning based methods to vehicle routing problems has emerged as a pivotal area of research in combinatorial optimization. These problems are characterized by vast solution spaces and intricate constraints, making traditional approaches such as exact mathematical models or heuristic methods prone to high computational overhead or reliant on the design of complex heuristic operators to achieve optimal or near optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although some recent learning-based methods can produce good performance for VRP with straightforward constraint scenarios, they often fail to effectively handle hard constraints that are common in practice. This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines constraint-oriented hypergraphs with reinforcement learning to address vehicle routing problems. A central innovation of this work is the development of a constraint-oriented dynamic hyperedge reconstruction strategy within an encoder, which significantly enhances hypergraph representation learning. Additionally, the decoder leverages a double-pointer attention mechanism to iteratively generate solutions. The proposed model is trained by incorporating asynchronous parameter updates informed by hypergraph constraints and optimizing a dual loss function comprising constraint loss and policy gradient loss. The experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the need for sophisticated heuristic operators but also achieves substantial improvements in solution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers [\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2}{King et al., Nature (2023)}] in solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results challenge the notion of a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

It has been demonstrated in the literature that such special-purpose solvers can outperform traditional CMOS architectures by orders of magnitude with respect to timing metrics on synthetic problems. However, they face challenges with constrained problems such as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), where mapping to binary formulations such as QUBO introduces overhead and limits parallelism. In-memory computing (IMC) devices, such as memristor-based analog Ising machines, offer significant speedups and efficiency gains over traditional CPU-based solvers, particularly for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we present a novel local search heuristic designed for IMC hardware to tackle the QAP. Our approach enables massive parallelism that allows for computing of full neighbourhoods simultaneously to make update decisions. We ensure binary solutions remain feasible by selecting local moves that lead to neighbouring feasible solutions, leveraging feasible-space search heuristics and the underlying structure of a given problem. Our approach is compatible with both digital computers and analog hardware. We demonstrate its effectiveness in CPU implementations by comparing it with state-of-the-art heuristics for solving the QAP.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This problem can be formulated within the context of set optimization. For high-dimensional nonlinear systems, the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It scales poorly too. Current literature poses combinatorial submodular set optimization problems via maximizing observability performance metrics subject to matroid constraints. Such an approach is typically solved using greedy algorithms that require lower computational effort yet often yield sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address the SNS problem for nonlinear dynamical networks using a variational form of the system dynamics, that basically perturb the system physics. As a result, we show that the observability performance metrics under such system representation are indeed submodular. The optimal problem is then solved using the multilinear continuous extension. This extension offers a computationally scalable and approximate continuous relaxation with a performance guarantee. The effectiveness of the extended submodular program is studied and compared to greedy algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed set optimization formulation for SNS on nonlinear natural gas combustion networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 2025 American Control Conference (ACC'2025), Denver, Colorado, July 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in quantum computing offer promising solutions for such problems. Coherent Ising Machines (CIM), a quantum-inspired algorithm, leverages the quantum properties of coherent light, enabling faster convergence to the ground state. This paper applies CIM to multi-objective routing optimization in wireless multi-hop networks. We formulate the routing problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and map it onto an Ising model, allowing CIM to solve it. CIM demonstrates strong scalability across diverse network topologies without requiring topology-specific adjustments, overcoming the limitations of traditional quantum algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our results show that CIM provides feasible and near-optimal solutions for networks containing hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges.

Whereas supervised learning requires pre-solved instances for training, our approach leverages a custom loss function derived from the exact penalty method in optimization to learn an approximation, typically defined by a neural network model, of the parameterized optimal solution mapping. Additionally, we adapt our approach to robust constrained combinatorial optimization problems by incorporating a surrogate linear cost over mixed integer domains, and a smooth approximations thereof, into the final layer of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments to test our approach on three different applications: multidimensional knapsack with continuous variables, combinatorial multidimensional knapsack with discrete variables, and an inventory management problem. Our results demonstrate that our self-supervised approach is able to effectively learn neural network approximations whose inference time is significantly smaller than the computation time of traditional solvers for this class of robust optimization problems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that by varying the penalty parameter we are able to effectively balance the trade-off between sub-optimality and robust feasibility of the obtained solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of CPAIOR 2025</p></details> |

Unlike the standard 3D printing, where all objects are printed slice by slice at once, in sequential 3D printing, objects are completed one after other. In the sequential case, it is necessary to ensure that the moving parts of the printer do not collide with previously printed objects. We look at the sequential printing problem from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. We propose to express the problem as a linear arithmetic formula, which is then solved using a solver for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). However, we do not solve the formula expressing the problem of object arrangement and scheduling directly, but we have proposed a technique inspired by counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR), which turned out to be a key innovation to efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Global Minimum Cut with Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05004v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global minimum cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem with wide-ranging applications. Often in practice, these problems are solved repeatedly on families of similar or related instances. However, the de facto algorithmic approach is to solve each instance of the problem from scratch discarding information from prior instances. In this paper, we consider how predictions informed by prior instances can be used to warm-start practical minimum cut algorithms. The paper considers the widely used Karger's algorithm and its counterpart, the Karger-Stein algorithm. Given good predictions, we show these algorithms become near-linear time and have robust performance to erroneous predictions. Both of these algorithms are randomized edge-contraction algorithms. Our natural idea is to probabilistically prioritize the contraction of edges that are unlikely to be in the minimum cut.</p></details> |  |

Hybrid classical-quantum computing techniques offer a novel approach to address these challenges. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variations are hybrid classical-quantum techniques, and a promising tool for combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper presents a Digitized Counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA) approach to molecular docking. Simulated quantum runs were conducted on a GPU cluster. We examined 14 and 17 nodes instances - to the best of our knowledge the biggest published instance is 12-node at Ding et al. and we present the results. Based on computational results, we conclude that binding interactions represent the anticipated exact solution. Additionally, as the size of the examined instance increases, the computational times exhibit a significant escalation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, we identify a critical issue in these methods, which we term ''wandering in contours''. This behavior refers to sampling new different solutions that share very similar objective values for a long time, leading to computational inefficiency and suboptimal exploration of potential solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel reheating mechanism inspired by the concept of critical temperature and specific heat in physics, aimed at overcoming this limitation. Empirically, our method demonstrates superiority over existing sampling-based and data-driven algorithms across a diverse array of CO problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the manual design of heuristics is resource-intensive and constrained by the designer's expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential to automate heuristic generation through evolutionary frameworks. Recent works focus only on well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem and online bin packing problem when designing constructive heuristics. This study investigates whether LLMs can effectively generate heuristics for niche, not yet broadly researched optimization problems, using the unit-load pre-marshalling problem as an example case. We propose the Contextual Evolution of Heuristics (CEoH) framework, an extension of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework, which incorporates problem-specific descriptions to enhance in-context learning during heuristic generation. Through computational experiments, we evaluate CEoH and EoH and compare the results. Results indicate that CEoH enables smaller LLMs to generate high-quality heuristics more consistently and even outperform larger models. Larger models demonstrate robust performance with or without contextualized prompts. The generated heuristics exhibit scalability to diverse instance configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review LION19: The 19th Learning and Intelligent OptimizatioN Conference</p></details> |

However, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on 100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |

It is not sufficient for agents to merely solve a given task; they must generalize to out-of-distribution tasks, perform reliably, and use hardware resources efficiently during training and inference, among other requirements. Several methods, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, are commonly used to tackle these problems, each with different trade-offs. However, there is a lack of benchmarking suites that define the environments, datasets, and metrics which can be used to provide a meaningful way for the community to compare progress on applying these methods to real-world problems. We introduce A2Perf--a benchmark with three environments that closely resemble real-world domains: computer chip floorplanning, web navigation, and quadruped locomotion. A2Perf provides metrics that track task performance, generalization, system resource efficiency, and reliability, which are all critical to real-world applications. Using A2Perf, we demonstrate that web navigation agents can achieve latencies comparable to human reaction times on consumer hardware, reveal reliability trade-offs between algorithms for quadruped locomotion, and quantify the energy costs of different learning approaches for computer chip-design. In addition, we propose a data cost metric to account for the cost incurred acquiring offline data for imitation learning and hybrid algorithms, which allows us to better compare these approaches. A2Perf also contains several standard baselines, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons across methods and facilitating progress in real-world autonomy. As an open-source benchmark, A2Perf is designed to remain accessible, up-to-date, and useful to the research community over the long term.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Bandwidth Observation Sharing for Multi-Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Intelligent Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09975v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.</p></details> |  |

The mechanics of the game present complex decision-making scenarios of resource management. Due the similarity of other card games, the strategy of the game have scenarios that can turn an NP-problem. This paper presents a model of an aggressive, single-turn strategy as a combinatorial optimization problem, termed the FAB problem. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate its equivalence to a 0-1 Knapsack problem, establishing the FAB problem as NP-hard. Additionally, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed to tackle real-world instances of the problem. By establishing the computational hardness of optimizing even relatively simple strategies, our work highlights the combinatorial complexity of the game.</p></details> |  |

However, these applications frequently exhibit robustness deficiencies, where slight perturbations in input (prompt+example) may lead to erroneous outputs. Current robustness testing methods face two main limitations: (1) low testing effectiveness, limiting the applicability of LLM-based software in safety-critical scenarios, and (2) insufficient naturalness of test cases, reducing the practical value of testing outcomes. To address these issues, this paper proposes ABFS, a straightforward yet effective automated testing method that, for the first time, treats the input prompts and examples as a unified whole for robustness testing. Specifically, ABFS formulates the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem, employing Best-First Search to identify successful test cases within the perturbation space and designing a novel Adaptive control strategy to enhance test case naturalness. We evaluate the robustness testing performance of ABFS on three datasets across five threat models. On Llama2-13b, the traditional StressTest achieves only a 13.273% success rate, while ABFS attains a success rate of 98.064%, supporting a more comprehensive robustness assessment before software deployment. Compared to baseline methods, ABFS introduces fewer modifications to the original input and consistently generates test cases with superior naturalness. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABFS exhibit stronger transferability and higher testing efficiency, significantly reducing testing costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMOPT: Learning to Define and Solve General Optimization Problems from Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13213v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems are prevalent across various scenarios. Formulating and then solving optimization problems described by natural language often requires highly specialized human expertise, which could block the widespread application of optimization-based decision making. To automate problem formulation and solving, leveraging large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a potential way. However, this kind of approach suffers from the issue of optimization generalization. Namely, the accuracy of most current LLM-based methods and the generality of optimization problem types that they can model are still limited. In this paper, we propose a unified learning-based framework called LLMOPT to boost optimization generalization. Starting from the natural language descriptions of optimization problems and a pre-trained LLM, LLMOPT constructs the introduced five-element formulation as a universal model for learning to define diverse optimization problem types. Then, LLMOPT employs the multi-instruction tuning to enhance both problem formalization and solver code generation accuracy and generality. After that, to prevent hallucinations in LLMs, such as sacrificing solving accuracy to avoid execution errors, the model alignment and self-correction mechanism are adopted in LLMOPT. We evaluate the optimization generalization ability of LLMOPT and compared methods across six real-world datasets covering roughly 20 fields such as health, environment, energy and manufacturing, etc. Extensive experiment results show that LLMOPT is able to model various optimization problem types such as linear/nonlinear programming, mixed integer programming, and combinatorial optimization, and achieves a notable 11.08% average solving accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The core component of NeuroSA consists of a pair of asynchronous ON-OFF neurons, which effectively map classical simulated annealing dynamics onto a network of integrate-and-fire neurons. The threshold of each ON-OFF neuron pair is adaptively adjusted by an FN annealer and the resulting spiking dynamics replicates the optimal escape mechanism and convergence of SA, particularly at low-temperatures. To validate the effectiveness of our neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and Max Independent Set. Across multiple runs, NeuroSA consistently generates distribution of solutions that are concentrated around the state-of-the-art results (within 99%) or surpass the current state-of-the-art solutions for Max Independent Set benchmarks. Furthermore, NeuroSA is able to achieve these superior distributions without any graph-specific hyperparameter tuning. For practical illustration, we present results from an implementation of NeuroSA on the SpiNNaker2 platform, highlighting the feasibility of mapping our proposed architecture onto a standard neuromorphic accelerator platform.</p></details> | 43 pages, 10 figures |

This paper introduces a new divide-and-conquer approach for causal graph learning, called DCILP. In the divide phase, the Markov blanket MB($X_i$) of each variable $X_i$ is identified, and causal learning subproblems associated with each MB($X_i$) are independently addressed in parallel. This approach benefits from a more favorable ratio between the number of data samples and the number of variables considered. In counterpart, it can be adversely affected by the presence of hidden confounders, as variables external to MB($X_i$) might influence those within it. The reconciliation of the local causal graphs generated during the divide phase is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, especially in large-scale applications. The main novelty of DCILP is an original formulation of this reconciliation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which can be delegated and efficiently handled by an ILP solver. Through experiments on medium to large scale graphs, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, DCILP demonstrates significant improvements in terms of computational complexity, while preserving the learning accuracy on real-world problem and suffering at most a slight loss of accuracy on synthetic problems.</p></details> |  |

Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github respository will be provided soon</p></details> |

While exact solutions are often not necessary, many applications require finding high-quality solutions quickly. For this purpose, we propose a data-driven approach to improve existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. We parameterize the approximation algorithm and train a graph neural network (GNN) to predict parameter values that lead to the best possible solutions. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion using gradient estimation, treating the approximation algorithm as a black box. We propose a novel gradient estimation scheme for this purpose, which we call preference-based gradient estimation. Our approach combines the benefits of the neural network and the non-learned approximation algorithm: The GNN leverages the information from the dataset to allow the approximation algorithm to find better solutions, while the approximation algorithm guarantees that the solution is feasible. We validate our approach on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the travelling salesman problem and the minimum k-cut problem, and show that our method is competitive with state of the art learned CO solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, under review</p></details> |

However, they generally rely on a separate neural model, specialized and trained for each single problem. Any variation of a problem requires adjustment of its model and re-training from scratch. In this paper, we propose GOAL (for Generalist combinatorial Optimization Agent Learner), a generalist model capable of efficiently solving multiple COPs and which can be fine-tuned to solve new COPs. GOAL consists of a single backbone plus light-weight problem-specific adapters for input and output processing. The backbone is based on a new form of mixed-attention blocks which allows to handle problems defined on graphs with arbitrary combinations of node, edge and instance-level features. Additionally, problems which involve heterogeneous types of nodes or edges are handled through a novel multi-type transformer architecture, where the attention blocks are duplicated to attend the meaningful combinations of types while relying on the same shared parameters. We train GOAL on a set of routing, scheduling and classic graph problems and show that it is only slightly inferior to the specialized baselines while being the first multi-task model that solves a wide range of COPs. Finally we showcase the strong transfer learning capacity of GOAL by fine-tuning it on several new problems.

Recently, quantum annealing (QA) based on quantum physics was introduced as a key enabler for solving optimization problems quickly. However, only some studies consider quantum-based approaches in wireless communications. Therefore, we investigate the performance of a QA solution to an optimization problem in wireless networks. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing clustering, sub-channel assignment, and power allocation in a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle-aided wireless network. We formulate the sum rate maximization problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Then, we divide it into two sub-problems: 1) a QA-based clustering and 2) sub-channel assignment and power allocation for a given clustering configuration. Subsequently, we obtain an optimized solution for the joint optimization problem by solving these two sub-problems. For the first sub-problem, we convert the problem into a simplified quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. As for the second sub-problem, we introduce a novel QA algorithm with optimal scaling parameters to address it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the sum rate and running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, and 2 tables.

These problems are often nuanced, their optimal solutions might not be efficiently obtainable, and they may require lots of time and compute resources to solve (they are NP-hard). It follows that the best course of action for solving these problems is to use general optimization algorithm paradigms to quickly and easily develop algorithms that are customized to these problems and can produce good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we present optimizn, a Python library for developing customized optimization algorithms under general optimization algorithm paradigms (simulated annealing, branch and bound). Additionally, optimizn offers continuous training, with which users can run their algorithms on a regular cadence, retain the salient aspects of previous runs, and use them in subsequent runs to potentially produce solutions that get closer and closer to optimality. An earlier version of this paper was peer reviewed and published internally at Microsoft.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we focus on families of combinatorial optimization problems that exhibit symmetry and contain planted solutions. We rigorously prove that the 1-step Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can achieve a success probability of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$, and sometimes $\Omega(1)$, for finding the exact solution in many cases. This allows us to prove a separation of $O(1)$ quantum queries and $\Omega(n/\log n)$ classical queries required to find the planted solution in the latter setting. Furthermore, we construct near-symmetric optimization problems by randomly sampling the individual clauses of symmetric problems, and prove that the QAOA maintains a strong success probability in this setting even when the symmetry is broken. Finally, we construct various families of near-symmetric Max-SAT problems and benchmark state-of-the-art classical solvers, discovering instances where all known general-purpose classical algorithms require exponential time. Therefore, our results indicate that low-depth QAOA may achieve an exponential quantum speedup for optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Diffusion-Inspired Quantum Noise Mitigation in Parameterized Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00843v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have been acknowledged as a leading strategy to utilize near-term quantum advantages in multiple problems, including machine learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effcient classical error correction for parity-encoded spin systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07170v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have garnered engineering interest across various industrial and social applications. Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate, with considerable efforts dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction among logical spins, its realization necessitates a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, presenting technical challenges in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed a parity-encoding (PE) architecture, which consists of an enlarged system of physical spins with only local connectivity among them, to circumvent this difficulty in developing near-future QA devices. They suggested that this architecture not only alleviates implementation challenges and enhances scalability but also possesses intrinsic fault tolerance, as logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded in the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses correcting errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected using a straightforward decoding algorithm that can be viewed as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm has been shown to perform comparably to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that the introduction of post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and enhances the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. Our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 1 Table, Major corrections</p></details> |
| **[Destroy and Repair Using Hyper Graphs for Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16170v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have shown promise in solving routing problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) without handcrafted designs. Research in this domain has explored two primary categories of methods: iterative and non-iterative. While non-iterative methods struggle to generate near-optimal solutions directly, iterative methods simplify the task by learning local search steps. However, existing iterative methods are often limited by restricted neighborhood searches, leading to suboptimal results. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that extends the search to larger neighborhoods by learning a destroy-and-repair strategy. Specifically, we introduce a Destroy-and-Repair framework based on Hyper-Graphs (DRHG). This framework reduces consecutive intact edges to hyper-edges, allowing the model to pay more attention to the destroyed part and decrease the complexity of encoding all nodes. Experiments demonstrate that DRHG achieves stateof-the-art performance on TSP with up to 10,000 nodes and shows strong generalization to real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI2025 |

This paper aims to advance this line of research by introducing Text2Zinc}, a cross-domain dataset for capturing optimization and satisfaction problems specified in natural language text. Our work is distinguished from previous attempts by integrating both satisfaction and optimization problems within a unified dataset using a solver-agnostic modeling language. To achieve this, we leverage MiniZinc's solver-and-paradigm-agnostic modeling capabilities to formulate these problems. Using the Text2Zinc dataset, we conduct comprehensive baseline experiments to compare execution and solution accuracy across several methods, including off-the-shelf prompting strategies, chain-of-thought reasoning, and a compositional approach. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of intermediary representations, specifically knowledge graphs. Our findings indicate that LLMs are not yet a push-button technology to model combinatorial problems from text. We hope that Text2Zinc serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance the field further.</p></details> |  |

However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy quantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits. Therefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful results. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to optimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit gate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First, we introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford subcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since Clifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption, which efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We demonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have wide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, many-body physics, and combinatorial optimization problems. Near-term algorithms such as VQE and QAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a $77.7\%$ reduction in CNOT gate count and up to an $84.1\%$ reduction in entangling depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Let $G$ be a complete edge-weighted graph; to each $3$-set of vertices of $G$ assign the sum of its minimum spanning tree as its weight. The $3$-Matching Problem is the combinatorial optimization problem of finding a minimum weight $3$-matching of $G$, where the weight of a $3$-matching is the sum of the weights of its $3$-sets. While the $3$-Matching Problem is known to be NP-hard, the complexity of its Euclidean variant remains open. In the Euclidean $3$-Matching Problem, the vertices of $G$ are a set of points in the plane, and the weight of an edge is given by the distance between its endpoints. In this paper we show that the Euclidean $3$-Matching Problem is NP-hard.</p></details> |  |

Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions for the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To solve our non-convex objective, we propose solving parallel multiple initializations using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. Therefore, we dub our method as parallelized Clique-Informed Quadratic Optimization for MIS (pCQO-MIS). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges.</p></details> |  |

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA "on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 |

Frequently, this is done with item response theoretic (IRT) models that describe the relationship between those latent traits and observed indicators. We combine recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric IRT, which makes minimal assumptions on shapes of item response functions, and Gaussian process time series methods to capture dynamic structures in latent traits from longitudinal observations. We propose a generalized dynamic Gaussian process item response theory (GD-GPIRT) as well as a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for estimation of both latent traits and response functions. We evaluate GD-GPIRT in simulation studies against baselines in dynamic IRT, and apply it to various substantive studies, including assessing public opinions on economy environment and congressional ideology related to abortion debate.</p></details> |  |

Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |

Existing methods are highly dependent on clean, high-quality inputs, making them susceptible to noise and real-world imperfections. Additionally, intricate temporal relationships in time series data are often inadequately captured in traditional 1D representations, leading to suboptimal modeling of dependencies. We introduce VISTA, a training-free, unsupervised TSAD algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. VISTA features three core modules: 1) Time Series Decomposition using Seasonal and Trend Decomposition via Loess (STL) to decompose noisy time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components; 2) Temporal Self-Attention, which transforms 1D time series into 2D temporal correlation matrices for richer dependency modeling and anomaly detection; and 3) Multivariate Temporal Aggregation, which uses a pretrained feature extractor to integrate cross-variable information into a unified, memory-efficient representation. VISTA's training-free approach enables rapid deployment and easy hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for industrial applications. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on five multivariate TSAD benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio.

| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

| **[Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal traffic time series, such as traffic speed data, collected from sensing systems are often incomplete, with considerable corruption and large amounts of missing values. A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Movement-Prediction-Adjusted Naïve Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469v7)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast, which is the original na\"ive forecast with the addition of a weighted movement prediction term, in the context of forecasting time series that exhibit symmetric random walk properties. The weight of the movement term is determined by two parameters: one reflecting the directional accuracy and the other representing the mean absolute increment. The settings of the two parameters involve a trade-off: larger values may yield meaningful gains over the original na\"ive forecast, whereas smaller values often render the adjusted forecast more reliable. This trade-off can be managed by empirically setting the parameters using sliding windows on in-sample data. To statistically test the performance of the adjusted na\"ive forecast under different directional accuracy levels, we used four synthetic time series to simulate multiple forecast scenarios, assuming that for each directional accuracy level, diverse movement predictions were provided. The simulation results show that as the directional accuracy increases, the error of the adjusted na\"ive forecast decreases. In particular, the adjusted na\"ive forecast achieves statistically significant improvements over the original na\"ive forecast, even under a low directional accuracy of slightly above 0.50. This finding implies that the movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast can serve as a new optimal point forecast for time series with symmetric random walk characteristics if consistent movement prediction can be provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastFlow: Early Yet Robust Network Flow Classification using the Minimal Number of Time-Series Packets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02174v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification is of great importance for network operators in their daily routines, such as analyzing the usage patterns of multimedia applications and optimizing network configurations. Internet service providers (ISPs) that operate high-speed links expect network flow classifiers to accurately classify flows early, using the minimal number of necessary initial packets per flow. These classifiers must also be robust to packet sequence disorders in candidate flows and capable of detecting unseen flow types that are not within the existing classification scope, which are not well achieved by existing methods. In this paper, we develop FastFlow, a time-series flow classification method that accurately classifies network flows as one of the known types or the unknown type, which dynamically selects the minimal number of packets to balance accuracy and efficiency. Toward the objectives, we first develop a flow representation process that converts packet streams at both per-packet and per-slot granularity for precise packet statistics with robustness to packet sequence disorders. Second, we develop a sequential decision-based classification model that leverages LSTM architecture trained with reinforcement learning. Our model makes dynamic decisions on the minimal number of time-series data points per flow for the confident classification as one of the known flow types or an unknown one. We evaluated our method on public datasets and demonstrated its superior performance in early and accurate flow classification. Deployment insights on the classification of over 22.9 million flows across seven application types and 33 content providers in a campus network over one week are discussed, showing that FastFlow requires an average of only 8.37 packets and 0.5 seconds to classify the application type of a flow with over 91% accuracy and over 96% accuracy for the content providers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025.

| **[Reducing Smoothness with Expressive Memory Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00349v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical forecasting models learn the structure of time series data via projecting onto a graph, with recent techniques capturing spatial-temporal associations between variables via edge weights. Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

| **[Niche Dynamics in Complex Online Community Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02153v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, conditionally accepted to ICWSM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Model Selection for Time Series Forecasting via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02119v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection is a critical step in time series forecasting, traditionally requiring extensive performance evaluations across various datasets. Meta-learning approaches aim to automate this process, but they typically depend on pre-constructed performance matrices, which are costly to build. In this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lightweight alternative for model selection. Our method eliminates the need for explicit performance matrices by utilizing the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA, GPT and Gemini, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional meta-learning techniques and heuristic baselines, while significantly reducing computational overhead. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in efficient model selection for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 Figures |

In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

The package emphasizes conditional Shapley value estimates, providing a comprehensive range of approaches for accurately capturing feature dependencies, which is crucial for correct model interpretation and lacking in similar software. In addition to regular tabular data, the shapr R-package includes specialized functionality for explaining time series forecasts. The package offers a minimal set of user functions with sensible defaults for most use cases while providing extensive flexibility for advanced users to fine-tune computations. Additional features include parallelized computations, iterative estimation with convergence detection, and rich visualization tools. shapr also extends its functionality to compute causal and asymmetric Shapley values when causal information is available. In addition, we introduce the shaprpy Python library, which brings core capabilities of shapr to the Python ecosystem. Overall, the package aims to enhance the interpretability of predictive models within a powerful and user-friendly framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference of hidden common driver dynamics by anisotropic self-organizing neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01811v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are introducing a novel approach to infer the underlying dynamics of hidden common drivers, based on analyzing time series data from two driven dynamical systems. The inference relies on time-delay embedding, estimation of the intrinsic dimension of the observed systems, and their mutual dimension. A key component of our approach is a new anisotropic training technique applied to Kohonen's self-organizing map, which effectively learns the attractor of the driven system and separates it into submanifolds corresponding to the self-dynamics and shared dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted simulated experiments using different chaotic maps in a setup, where two chaotic maps were driven by a third map with nonlinear coupling. The inferred time series exhibited high correlation with the time series of the actual hidden common driver, in contrast to the observed systems. The quality of our reconstruction were compared and shown to be superior to several other methods that are intended to find the common features behind the observed time series, including linear methods like PCA and ICA as well as nonlinear methods like dynamical component analysis, canonical correlation analysis and even deep canonical correlation analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLaP -- State Detection from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01783v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the environment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series (TS). These recordings encode the recognizable properties of latent states and transitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes. The unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their transitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state or not. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 391 TS from four benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states than five state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of CLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges.

This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |

This work presents clustering approaches for functional time series that combine the fuzzy $C$-medoids and fuzzy $C$-means procedures with a novel dissimilarity measure tailored for functional data. This dissimilarity is based on an extension of the quantile autocorrelation to the functional context. Our methods effectively groups time series with similar dependence structures, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency in simulations. The practical utility of the approach is demonstrated through case studies on high-frequency financial stock data and multi-country age-specific mortality improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 6 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

The core challenge lies in effectively modeling dependencies both within sequences and channels. Convolutional Neural Networks and Linear models often excel in sequence modeling but frequently fall short in capturing complex channel dependencies. In contrast, Transformer-based models, with their attention mechanisms applied to both sequences and channels, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. Our research proposes a new approach for capturing sequence and channel dependencies: AverageTime, an exceptionally simple yet effective structure. By employing mixed channel embedding and averaging operations, AverageTime separately captures correlations for sequences and channels through channel mapping and result averaging. In addition, we integrate clustering methods to further accelerate the model's training process. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AverageTime surpasses state-of-the-art models in predictive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to lightweight linear models. This provides a new and effective framework for modeling long time series.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel approach using a prefixed patch time series Transformer model that automates the solution of two-point boundary value problems from lunar flyby to arbitrary terminal conditions. Using prefix tokens of terminal conditions in our deep generative model enables solving boundary value problems in three-body dynamics. The training dataset consists of trajectories obtained through forward propagation rather than solving boundary value problems directly. The model demonstrates potential practical utility for preliminary trajectory design in cislunar mission scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Time series modeling serves as the cornerstone of real-world applications, such as weather forecasting and transportation management. Recently, Mamba has become a promising model that combines near-linear computational complexity with high prediction accuracy in time series modeling, while facing challenges such as insufficient modeling of nonlinear dependencies in attention and restricted receptive fields caused by convolutions. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative framework, Attention Mamba, featuring a novel Adaptive Pooling block that accelerates attention computation and incorporates global information, effectively overcoming the constraints of limited receptive fields. Furthermore, Attention Mamba integrates a bidirectional Mamba block, efficiently capturing long-short features and transforming inputs into the Value representations for attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets underscore the effectiveness of Attention Mamba in extracting nonlinear dependencies and enhancing receptive fields, establishing superior performance among leading counterparts.

Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that offers broad applicability similar to MLP while effectively addressing periodicity modeling challenges. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach maintains the general-purpose modeling capability. Therefore, FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various model architectures with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, e.g., symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, language modeling, and image recognition.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress, it becomes challenging in the presence of noise, especially when derivatives need to be calculated. To reduce the effect of noise, we propose a method that simultaneously fits both the derivative and trajectory from noisy time-series data. Our approach formulates derivative estimation as an inverse problem involving integral operators within the forward model, and estimates the derivative function by solving a regularization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS). We derive an integral-form representer theorem, which enables the computation of the regularized solution by solving a finite-dimensional problem and facilitates efficiently estimating the optimal regularization parameter. By embedding the dynamics within a vRKHS and utilizing the fitted derivative and trajectory, we can recover the underlying dynamics from noisy data by solving a linear regularization problem. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Reservoir Computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12382v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |

To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 7.2% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (04/2025).

Specifically, we propose new interactive privacy mechanisms for three tasks: estimating a single covariance coefficient, estimating the spectral density at a fixed frequency, and estimating the entire spectral density function. Our approach achieves faster rates through a two-stage process: we apply first the Laplace mechanism to the truncated value and then use the former privatized sample to gain knowledge on the dependence mechanism in the time series. For spectral densities belonging to H\"older and Sobolev smoothness classes, we demonstrate that our estimators improve upon the non-interactive mechanism of Kroll (2024) for small privacy parameter $\alpha$, since the pointwise rates depend on $n\alpha^2$ instead of $n\alpha^4$. Moreover, we show that the rate $(n\alpha^4)^{-1}$ is optimal for estimating a covariance coefficient with non-interactive mechanisms. However, the $L_2$ rate of our interactive estimator is slower than the pointwise rate. We show how to use these estimators to provide a bona-fide locally differentially private covariance matrix estimator.</p></details> | 47 pages |

In this study, we employ clustering techniques to analyse traffic flow data with the dual objective of uncovering meaningful traffic patterns and detecting anomalies, including sensor failures and irregular congestion events. We explore multiple clustering approaches, i.e partitioning and hierarchical methods, combined with various time-series representations and similarity measures. Our methodology is applied to real-world data from highway sensors, enabling us to assess the impact of different clustering frameworks on traffic pattern recognition. We also introduce a clustering-driven anomaly detection methodology that identifies deviations from expected traffic behaviour based on distance-based anomaly scores. Results indicate that hierarchical clustering with symbolic representations provides robust segmentation of traffic patterns, while partitioning methods such as k-means and fuzzy c-means yield meaningful results when paired with Dynamic Time Warping. The proposed anomaly detection strategy successfully identifies sensor malfunctions and abnormal traffic conditions with minimal false positives, demonstrating its practical utility for real-time monitoring. Real-world vehicular traffic data are provided by Autostrade Alto Adriatico S.p.A.</p></details> |  |

Extracting these groupings from the data provides a course-grained description of the complex system in question and can inform subsequent prediction tasks. We develop a novel methodology to model such a panel as a restricted vector autoregressive process, where the coefficient matrix is the weighted adjacency matrix of a stochastic block model. This network time series model, which we call the Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (NIRVAR) model, yields a coefficient matrix that has a sparse block-diagonal structure. We propose an estimation procedure that embeds each panel component in a low-dimensional latent space and clusters the embedded points to recover the blocks of the coefficient matrix. Crucially, the method allows for network-based time series modelling when the underlying network is unobserved. We derive the bias, consistency and asymptotic normality of the NIRVAR estimator. Simulation studies suggest that the NIRVAR estimated embedded points are Gaussian distributed around the ground truth latent positions. On three applications to finance, macroeconomics, and transportation systems, NIRVAR outperforms competing models in terms of prediction and provides interpretable results regarding group recovery.</p></details> | 27 pages |

We establish a clear link between predictor serial correlation and the performance of the LASSO, showing that even orthogonal or weakly correlated stationary AR processes can lead to significant spurious correlations due to their serial correlations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named ARMAr-LASSO ({\em ARMA residuals LASSO}), which applies the LASSO to predictors that have been pre-whitened with ARMA filters and lags of dependent variable. We derive both asymptotic results and oracle inequalities for the ARMAr-LASSO, demonstrating that it effectively reduces estimation errors while also providing an effective forecasting and feature selection strategy. Our findings are supported by extensive simulations and an application to real-world macroeconomic data, which highlight the superior performance of the ARMAr-LASSO for handling sparse linear models in the context of time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 3 Figures, 4 Tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2208.00727</p></details> |
| **[Innovative LSGTime Model for Crime Spatiotemporal Prediction Based on MindSpore Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20136v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the acceleration of urbanization, the spatiotemporal characteristics of criminal activities have become increasingly complex. Accurate prediction of crime distribution is crucial for optimizing the allocation of police resources and preventing crime. This paper proposes LGSTime, a crime spatiotemporal prediction model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism. LSTM and GRU capture long-term dependencies in crime time series, such as seasonality and periodicity, through their unique gating mechanisms. The Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism, on the other hand, focuses on both temporal and spatial features of criminal events simultaneously through parallel processing and sparsification techniques, significantly improving computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The integrated model leverages the strengths of each technique to better handle complex spatiotemporal data. Experimental findings demonstrate that the model attains optimal performance across four real - world crime datasets. In comparison to the CNN model, it exhibits performance enhancements of 2.8\%, 1.9\%, and 1.4\% in the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics respectively. These results offer a valuable reference for tackling the challenges in crime prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-Dependent Perturbation Effects in Evaluating Time Series Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17022v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contribute the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through systematic empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we reveal previously overlooked class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions, offering particular value for class-imbalanced datasets. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI-2025)</p></details> |

For this reason, their structural behavior must be assessed in multiple realistic ground shaking scenarios (e.g., the Maximum Credible Earthquake). However, earthquake catalogs and recorded seismograms may not always be available in the region of interest. Therefore, synthetic earthquake ground motion is progressively being employed, although with some due precautions: earthquake physics is sometimes not well enough understood to be accurately reproduced with numerical tools, and the underlying epistemic uncertainties lead to prohibitive computational costs related to model calibration. In this study, we propose an AI physics-based approach to generate synthetic ground motion, based on the combination of a neural operator that approximates the elastodynamics Green's operator in arbitrary source-geology setups, enhanced by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. The diffusion model is trained to correct the ground motion time series generated by the neural operator. Our results show that such an approach promisingly enhances the realism of the generated synthetic seismograms, with frequency biases and Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) scores being improved by the diffusion model. This indicates that the latter is capable to mitigate the mid-frequency spectral falloff observed in the time series generated by the neural operator. Our method showcases fast and cheap inference in different site and source conditions.</p></details> |  |

Our Seismic Velocity Inversion Network (SVInvNet) introduces a novel architecture that contains a multi-connection encoder-decoder structure enhanced with dense blocks. This design is specifically tuned to effectively process time series data, which is essential for addressing the challenges of non-linear seismic velocity inversion. For training and testing, we created diverse seismic velocity models, including multi-layered, faulty, and salt dome categories. We also investigated how different kinds of ambient noise, both coherent and stochastic, and the size of the training dataset affect learning outcomes. SVInvNet is trained on datasets ranging from 750 to 6,000 samples and is tested using a large benchmark dataset of 12,000 samples. Despite its fewer parameters compared to the baseline model, SVInvNet achieves superior performance with this dataset. The performance of SVInvNet was further evaluated using the OpenFWI dataset and Marmousi-derived velocity models. The comparative analysis clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint of the accepted manuscript to appear in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

While asymptotic error bounds have been established for specific ARMA models on $L^2[0,1]$, a general theoretical framework has not yet been considered. This paper fills in this gap by deriving consistent estimators for the operators characterizing the invertible representation of a functional time series with white noise innovations in a general separable Hilbert space. Under mild conditions covering a broad class of functional time series, we establish explicit asymptotic error bounds, with rates determined by operator smoothness and eigenvalue decay. These results further provide consistency-rate estimates for operators in Hilbert space-valued causal linear processes, including functional MA, AR, and ARMA models of arbitrary order.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResNLS: An Improved Model for Stock Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01020v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock prices forecasting has always been a challenging task. Although many research projects try to address the problem, few of them pay attention to the varying degrees of dependencies between stock prices. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid model that improves the prediction of stock prices by emphasizing the dependencies between adjacent stock prices. The proposed model, ResNLS, is mainly composed of two neural architectures, ResNet and LSTM. ResNet serves as a feature extractor to identify dependencies between stock prices, while LSTM analyzes the initial time series data with the combination of dependencies, which are considered as residuals. Our experiment reveals that when the closing price data for the previous 5 consecutive trading days is used as input, the performance of the model (ResNLS-5) is optimal compared to those with other inputs. Furthermore, ResNLS-5 demonstrates at least a 20% improvement over current state-of-the-art baselines. To verify whether ResNLS-5 can help clients effectively avoid risks and earn profits in the stock market, we construct a quantitative trading framework for back testing. The result shows that the trading strategy based on ResNLS-5 predictions can successfully mitigate losses during declining stock prices and generate profits in periods of rising stock prices.

This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, the integration of TDA with time-series prediction remains underexplored due to three primary challenges: the limited utilization of temporal dependencies within topological features, computational bottlenecks associated with persistent homology, and the deterministic nature of TDA pipelines restricting generalized feature learning. This study addresses these challenges by proposing the Topological Information Supervised (TIS) Prediction framework, which leverages neural networks and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to generate synthetic topological features, preserving their distribution while significantly reducing computational time. We propose a novel training strategy that integrates topological consistency loss to improve the predictive accuracy of deep learning models. Specifically, we introduce two state-of-the-art models, TIS-BiGRU and TIS-Informer, designed to capture short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, respectively. Comparative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of TIS models over conventional predictors, validating the effectiveness of integrating topological information. This work not only advances TDA-based time-series prediction but also opens new avenues for utilizing topological features in deep learning architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experiments are incomplete</p></details> |

Transfer learning mitigates this by leveraging data from similar domains, but selecting appropriate source domains is crucial to avoid negative transfer. This study enhances source domain selection in transfer learning by introducing Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations to improve time series similarity functions. We evaluate a comprehensive range of baseline similarity functions, including both basic and state-of-the-art (SOTA) functions, and perform extensive experiments with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results demonstrate that GAF-based similarity functions significantly reduce prediction errors. Notably, Coral (GAF) for DNN and CMD (GAF) for LSTM consistently deliver superior performance, highlighting their effectiveness in complex financial environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to study the robustness of Foundational Models for Time Series (FMTS) with respect to input perturbations. We evaluate our approach to the stock price prediction problem, a well-studied problem with easily accessible public data, evaluating six state-of-the-art (some multi-modal) FMTS across six prominent stocks spanning three industries. The ratings proposed by our framework effectively assess the robustness of FMTS and also offer actionable insights for model selection and deployment. Within the scope of our study, we find that (1) multi-modal FMTS exhibit better robustness and accuracy compared to their uni-modal versions and, (2) FMTS pre-trained on time series forecasting task exhibit better robustness and forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose FMTS pre-trained across diverse settings. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing FMTS prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirmed that our ratings reduced the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different systems.</p></details> |  |

The asymptotic theory for non-parametric estimation is well-known but the development of non-asymptotic theory is still ongoing. Our recent work obtained the first non-asymptotic error bounds on the Bartlett and Welch methods for $L$-mixing stochastic processes. The class of $L$-mixing processes contains common models in time series analysis, including autoregressive processes and measurements of geometrically ergodic Markov chains. Our prior analysis assumes that the process has zero mean. While zero-mean assumptions are common, real-world time-series data often has unknown, non-zero mean. In this work, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for both Bartlett and Welch estimators for $L$-mixing time-series data with unknown means. The obtained error bounds are of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$, where $k$ is the number of data segments used in the algorithm, which are tighter than our previous results under the zero-mean assumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, Under Review for Conference on Decision and Control 2025</p></details> |

However, while existing methods have shown success in image-based tasks, their effectiveness remains unexplored for sequential time-series data from sensor systems, particularly audio inputs. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study evaluating six representative Meta-CL approaches using three network architectures on five datasets from both image and audio modalities. We develop MetaCLBench, an end-to-end Meta-CL benchmark framework for edge devices to evaluate system overheads and investigate trade-offs among performance, computational costs, and memory requirements across various Meta-CL methods. Our results reveal that while many Meta-CL methods enable to learn new classes for both image and audio modalities, they impose significant computational and memory costs on edge devices. Also, we find that pre-training and meta-training procedures based on source data before deployment improve Meta-CL performance. Finally, to facilitate further research, we provide practical guidelines for researchers and machine learning practitioners implementing Meta-CL on resource-constrained environments and make our benchmark framework and tools publicly available, enabling fair evaluation across both accuracy and system-level metrics.</p></details> |  |

To answer this question, this research investigates the structuring, articulation, and promotion of autism-related disinformation in conspiracy theory communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. By analyzing publications from 1,659 Telegram communities over ten years (2015 - 2025) and examining more than 58 million pieces of shared content from approximately 5.3 million users, this study explores how false narratives about autism are promoted, including unfounded claims about its causes and promises of miraculous cures. The adopted methodology combines network analysis, time series analysis, thematic clustering, and content analysis, enabling the identification of dissemination patterns, key influencers, and interconnections with other conspiracy theories. Among the key findings, Brazilian communities stand out as the leading producers and distributors of these narratives in the region, accounting for 46% of the analyzed content. Additionally, there has been an exponential 15,000% (x151) increase in the volume of autism-related disinformation since the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the correlation between health crises and the rise of conspiracy beliefs. The research also reveals that false cures, such as chlorine dioxide (CDS), ozone therapy, and extreme diets, are widely promoted within these communities and commercially exploited, often preying on desperate families in exchange for money. By addressing the research question, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of the disinformation ecosystem and proposes critical reflections on how to confront these harmful narratives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Engli...</summary><p>English and Portuguese versions, with 124 pages together</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a flexible framework using continuous-time hidden Markov model (CTHMM) to model and analyze trip-level telematics data. Unlike existing methods, the CTHMM models raw time-series data without predefined thresholds on harsh driving events or assumptions about accident probabilities. Moreover, our analysis is based solely on telematics data, requiring no traditional covariates such as driver or vehicle characteristics. Through unsupervised anomaly detection based on pseudo-residuals, we identify deviations from normal driving patterns -- defined as the prevalent behaviour observed in a driver's history or across the population -- which are linked to accident risk. Validated on both controlled and real-world datasets, the CTHMM effectively detects abnormal driving behaviour and trips with increased accident likelihood. In real data analysis, higher anomaly levels in longitudinal and lateral accelerations consistently correlate with greater accident risk, with classification models using this information achieving ROC-AUC values as high as 0.86 for trip-level analysis and 0.78 for distinguishing drivers with claims. Furthermore, the methodology reveals significant behavioural differences between drivers with and without claims, offering valuable insights for insurance applications, accident analysis, and prevention.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we develop a deep learning (DL) time series forecasting framework referred to as \textit{EMForecaster}. The proposed DL architecture employs patching to process temporal patterns at multiple scales, complemented by reversible instance normalization and mixing operations along both temporal and patch dimensions for efficient feature extraction. We augment {EMForecaster} with a conformal prediction mechanism, which is independent of the data distribution, to enhance the trustworthiness of model predictions via uncertainty quantification of forecasts. This conformal prediction mechanism ensures that the ground truth lies within a prediction interval with target error rate $\alpha$, where $1-\alpha$ is referred to as coverage. However, a trade-off exists, as increasing coverage often results in wider prediction intervals. To address this challenge, we propose a new metric called the \textit{Trade-off Score}, that balances trustworthiness of the forecast (i.e., coverage) and the width of prediction interval. Our experiments demonstrate that EMForecaster achieves superior performance across diverse EMF datasets, spanning both short-term and long-term prediction horizons. In point forecasting tasks, EMForecaster substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art DL approaches, showing improvements of 53.97\% over the Transformer architecture and 38.44\% over the average of all baseline models. EMForecaster also exhibits an excellent balance between prediction interval width and coverage in conformal forecasting, measured by the tradeoff score, showing marked improvements of 24.73\% over the average baseline and 49.17\% over the Transformer architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Times2D: Multi-Period Decomposition and Derivative Mapping for General Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00118v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important application in various domains such as energy management, traffic planning, financial markets, meteorology, and medicine. However, real-time series data often present intricate temporal variability and sharp fluctuations, which pose significant challenges for time series forecasting. Previous models that rely on 1D time series representations usually struggle with complex temporal variations. To address the limitations of 1D time series, this study introduces the Times2D method that transforms the 1D time series into 2D space. Times2D consists of three main parts: first, a Periodic Decomposition Block (PDB) that captures temporal variations within a period and between the same periods by converting the time series into a 2D tensor in the frequency domain. Second, the First and Second Derivative Heatmaps (FSDH) capture sharp changes and turning points, respectively. Finally, an Aggregation Forecasting Block (AFB) integrates the output tensors from PDB and FSDH for accurate forecasting. This 2D transformation enables the utilization of 2D convolutional operations to effectively capture long and short characteristics of the time series. Comprehensive experimental results across large-scale data in the literature demonstrate that the proposed Times2D model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting.

FANTF leverages a proposed fuzzy attention mechanism incorporating fuzzy membership functions to handle uncertainty and imprecision in noisy and ambiguous time series data. The FANTF approach enhances its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and multivariate relationships by embedding fuzzy logic principles into the self-attention module of the existing transformer's architecture. The framework combines fuzzy-enhanced attention with a set of benchmark existing transformer-based architectures to provide efficient predictions, classification and anomaly detection. Specifically, FANTF generates learnable fuzziness attention scores that highlight the relative importance of temporal features and data points, offering insights into its decision-making process. Experimental evaluatios on some real-world datasets reveal that FANTF significantly enhances the performance of forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks over traditional transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging quantum superpositions, entanglement, and variational quantum eigensolver principles, the model introduces a quantum-classical hybrid self-attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations across time points. For multivariate long-term time series, the quantum self-attention mechanism can reduce computational complexity while maintaining temporal relationships. It then applies the quantum-classical hybrid self-attention mechanism alongside a feed-forward network in the encoder stage of the advanced patch-based transformer. While the feed-forward network learns nonlinear representations for each variable frame, the quantum self-attention mechanism processes individual series to enhance multivariate relationships. The advanced patch-based transformer computes the optimized patch length by dividing the sequence length into a fixed number of patches instead of using an arbitrary set of values. The stride is then set to half of the patch length to ensure efficient overlapping representations while maintaining temporal continuity. QCAAPatchTF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on complex real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.</p></details> |  |

The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting, offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future. However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with referencing, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[ModelRadar: Aspect-based Forecast Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00059v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate evaluation of forecasting models is essential for ensuring reliable predictions. Current practices for evaluating and comparing forecasting models focus on summarising performance into a single score, using metrics such as SMAPE. While convenient, averaging performance over all samples dilutes relevant information about model behavior under varying conditions. This limitation is especially problematic for time series forecasting, where multiple layers of averaging--across time steps, horizons, and multiple time series in a dataset--can mask relevant performance variations. We address this limitation by proposing ModelRadar, a framework for evaluating univariate time series forecasting models across multiple aspects, such as stationarity, presence of anomalies, or forecasting horizons. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework by comparing 24 forecasting methods, including classical approaches and different machine learning algorithms. NHITS, a state-of-the-art neural network architecture, performs best overall but its superiority varies with forecasting conditions. For instance, concerning the forecasting horizon, we found that NHITS (and also other neural networks) only outperforms classical approaches for multi-step ahead forecasting. Another relevant insight is that classical approaches such as ETS or Theta are notably more robust in the presence of anomalies. These and other findings highlight the importance of aspect-based model evaluation for both practitioners and researchers. ModelRadar is available as a Python package.</p></details> |  |

The proposed procedure can distinguish between integer-integrated time series and fractionally-integrated ones, and it has broad applicability in practice. Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that the proposed testing procedure performs reasonably well. We apply our methodology to Canadian yield curve data and French sub-national age-specific mortality data. We find evidence that these time series are mostly integrated of order one, while some have fractional orders exceeding or falling below one.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v5)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incremental capacity-based multi-feature fusion model for predicting state-of-health of lithium-ion batteries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23858v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lithium-ion batteries have become an indispensable part of human industrial production and daily life. For the safe use, management and maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is an important indicator so that the SOH estimation is of significant practical value. In order to accurately predict SOH, this paper proposes a fusion prediction model which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, bi-directional long-short time memory network (BiLSTM) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. In the proposed prediction model, indirect health indicators (HIs), which characterize battery degradation, are obtained with the help of incremental capacity analysis (ICA), and is fed into BiLSTM to extract time-series features, whose parameters are optimized by employing PSO algorithm. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the PSO-BiLSTM model. The study based on lithium-ion battery data from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) shows that the PSO-BiLSTM-AdaBoost model has higher accuracy, better robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17523v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Feedfoward Neural Networks are Almost All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23621v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are everywhere -- from finance to healthcare -- and each domain brings its own unique complexities and structures. While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform Band-pass Filter Extension for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23493v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces a novel extension, called the Extended Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (EKZFT), to an existing class of band-pass filters first introduced by Kolmogorov and Zurbenko. Their original Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (KZFT) is a useful tool in time series and spatio-temporal analysis, Fourier analysis, and related statistical analysis fields. Example uses of these filters include separating frequencies, filtering portions of the spectra, reconstructing seasonality, investigating periodic signals, and reducing noise. KZFT filters have many practical applications across a wide range of disciplines including health, social, natural, and physical sciences. KZFT filters are band-pass filters defined by three arguments: the length of the filter window; the number of iterations; and the central frequency of the band-pass filter. However, the KZFT filter is limited in design to only positive odd integer widow lengths inherited from the time series. Therefore, for any combination of the other KZFT filter arguments, there is only a relatively small, discrete, selection of possible filter window lengths in a range determined by the size of the dataset. This limits the utility of KZFT filters for many of the stated uses. The proposed EKZFT filter allows a continuous selection of filter window length arguments over the same range, offering improved control, increased functionality, and wider practical use of this band-pass filter. An example application of the EKZFT in a data simulation is provided.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</p></details> |  |

The framework is then used to make inferences on the change in interdependencies between several economic indicators due to the impact of the Great Recession, the financial crisis that lasted from 2007 through 2009. There are several key advantages of the proposed framework; (1) it develops a reparametrized VAR likelihood that can be used in general high-dimensional VAR problems, (2) it strictly maintains causality of the estimated process, making inference on stationary features more meaningful and (3) it is computationally efficient due to the reduced rank structure of the parameterization. We apply the methodology to the seasonally adjusted quarterly economic indicators available in the FRED-QD database of the Federal Reserve. The analysis essentially confirms much of the prevailing knowledge about the impact of the Great Recession on different economic indicators. At the same time, it provides deeper insight into the nature and extent of the impact on the interplay of the different indicators. We also contribute to the theory of Bayesian VAR by showing the consistency of the posterior under sparse priors for the parameters of the reduced rank formulation of the VAR process.</p></details> |  |

Seizures disrupt coherence and functional connectivity, necessitating precise detection. Departing from traditional parametric approaches, we utilize the Wold decomposition, representing general time series as autoregressive processes with infinite lags, which are truncated and estimated around the change point. Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals. The proposed method effectively identifies seizure onset in EEG data and extends to event detection in video data. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>95 pa...</summary><p>95 pages, 17 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |

Under a formal definition of privacy protection, differentially private algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential data or during the data analysis process to produce privacy-protected datasets or queries. However, restricting access to only privatized data during statistical analysis makes it computationally challenging to make valid statistical inferences. In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. In addition to sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation, we adopt neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and with ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

Ethereum, being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant market fluctuations, making its price prediction an attractive yet complex problem. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting Ethereum prices for short-term and few-shot forecasting scenarios. The main challenge in training models for time series analysis is the lack of data. We address this by leveraging a novel approach that adapts existing pre-trained LLMs on natural language or images from billions of tokens to the unique characteristics of Ethereum price time series data. Through thorough experimentation and comparison with traditional and contemporary models, our results demonstrate that selectively freezing certain layers of pre-trained LLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This approach consistently surpasses benchmarks across multiple metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our research not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge on LLMs but also provides practical insights in the cryptocurrency prediction domain. The adaptability of pre-trained LLMs to handle the nature of Ethereum prices suggests a promising direction for future research, potentially including the integration of sentiment analysis to further refine forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel multimodal Transformer based framework for predicting the 3 days and 5 days planetary Kp index by integrating heterogeneous data sources, including satellite measurements, solar images, and KP time series. A key innovation is the incorporation of the Wasserstein distance into the transformer and the loss function to align the probability distributions across modalities. Comparative experiments with the NOAA model demonstrate performance, accurately capturing both the quiet and storm phases of geomagnetic activity. This study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning techniques with traditional models for improved real time forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series across Heterogeneous Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23060v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of digital services, along with the scale and complexity at which they operate, has made incidents in IT operations increasingly more likely, diverse, and impactful. This has led to the rapid development of a central aspect of "Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations" (AIOps), focusing on detecting anomalies in vast amounts of multivariate time series data generated by service entities. In this paper, we begin by introducing a unifying framework for benchmarking unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, and highlight the problem of shifts in normal behaviors that can occur in practical AIOps scenarios. To tackle anomaly detection under domain shift, we then cast the problem in the framework of domain generalization and propose a novel approach, Domain-Invariant VAE for Anomaly Detection (DIVAD), to learn domain-invariant representations for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our evaluation results using the Exathlon benchmark show that the two main DIVAD variants significantly outperform the best unsupervised AD method in maximum performance, with 20% and 15% improvements in maximum peak F1-scores, respectively. Evaluation using the Application Server Dataset further demonstrates the broader applicability of our domain generalization methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, "the best of two worlds", from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at AAAI 2025 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

Density functions are nonnegative and have a constrained integral; they thus do not constitute a vector space. Implementing unconstrained functional time-series forecasting methods is problematic for such nonlinear and constrained data. A novel forecasting method is developed based on a nonparametric function-on-function regression, where both the response and the predictor are probability density functions. Through a series of Monte-Carlo simulation studies, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of our nonparametric regression estimator. Using French departmental COVID19 data and age-specific period life tables in the United States, we assess and compare finite-sample forecast accuracy between the proposed and several existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Imputation of Hierarchical Nonlinear Time Series Data with an Application to School Enrollment Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01872v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>International comparisons of hierarchical time series data sets based on survey data, such as annual country-level estimates of school enrollment rates, can suffer from large amounts of missing data due to differing coverage of surveys across countries and across times. A popular approach to handling missing data in these settings is through multiple imputation, which can be especially effective when there is an auxiliary variable that is strongly predictive of and has a smaller amount of missing data than the variable of interest. However, standard methods for multiple imputation of hierarchical time series data can perform poorly when the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest have a nonlinear relationship. Performance can also suffer if the multiple imputations are used to estimate an analysis model that makes different assumptions about the data compared to the imputation model, leading to uncongeniality between analysis and imputation models. We propose a Bayesian method for multiple imputation of hierarchical nonlinear time series data that uses a sequential decomposition of the joint distribution and incorporates smoothing splines to account for nonlinear relationships between variables. We compare the proposed method with existing multiple imputation methods through a simulation study and an application to secondary school enrollment data. We find that the proposed method can lead to substantial performance increases for estimation of parameters in uncongenial analysis models and for prediction of individual missing values.</p></details> | 34 pages, 5 figures |

However, applying counterfactual methods to time series models remains challenging due to temporal dependencies, high dimensionality, and the lack of an intuitive human-interpretable representation. We introduce MASCOTS, a method that leverages the Bag-of-Receptive-Fields representation alongside symbolic transformations inspired by Symbolic Aggregate Approximation. By operating in a symbolic feature space, it enhances interpretability while preserving fidelity to the original data and model. Unlike existing approaches that either depend on model structure or autoencoder-based sampling, MASCOTS directly generates meaningful and diverse counterfactual observations in a model-agnostic manner, operating on both univariate and multivariate data. We evaluate MASCOTS on univariate and multivariate benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable validity, proximity, and plausibility to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly improving interpretability and sparsity. Its symbolic nature allows for explanations that can be expressed visually, in natural language, or through semantic representations, making counterfactual reasoning more accessible and actionable.</p></details> |  |

Consistency is established under $\alpha$-mixing, while asymptotic normality follows from $\beta$-mixing and second-order conditions.

We apply our method to extreme event modeling in the oil industry, revealing distinct tail behaviors under varying conditioning values.</p></details> |  |

Graph models allow us to capture the hidden dependencies of the multivariate time-series when the graphs are constructed in a similar dynamic manner. Previous dynamic graph models require a pre-defined and/or static graph structure, which is unknown in most cases, or they only capture the spatial relations between the features. Furthermore in healthcare, the interpretability of the model is an essential requirement to build trust with clinicians. In addition to previously proposed attention mechanisms, there has not been an interpretable dynamic graph framework for data from multivariate electronic health records (EHRs). Here, we propose DynaGraph, an end-to-end interpretable contrastive graph model that learns the dynamics of multivariate time-series EHRs as part of optimisation. We validate our model in four real-world clinical datasets, ranging from primary care to secondary care settings with broad demographics, in challenging settings where tasks are imbalanced and multi-labelled. Compared to state-of-the-art models, DynaGraph achieves significant improvements in balanced accuracy and sensitivity over the nearest complex competitors in time-series or dynamic graph modelling across three ICU and one primary care datasets. Through a pseudo-attention approach to graph construction, our model also indicates the importance of clinical covariates over time, providing means for clinical validation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SymDQN, a novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.

Recent progress in Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) shows promise in expediting this process. However, the formal corpora available on the Internet are limited compared to the general text, posing a significant data scarcity challenge for NTP. To address this issue, this work proposes Alchemy, a general framework for data synthesis that constructs formal theorems through symbolic mutation. Specifically, for each candidate theorem in Mathlib, we identify all invocable theorems that can be used to rewrite or apply to it. Subsequently, we mutate the candidate theorem by replacing the corresponding term in the statement with its equivalent form or antecedent. As a result, our method increases the number of theorems in Mathlib by an order of magnitude, from 110k to 6M. Furthermore, we perform continual pretraining and supervised finetuning on this augmented corpus for large language models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a 4.70% absolute performance improvement on Leandojo benchmark. Additionally, our approach achieves a 2.47% absolute performance gain on the out-of-distribution miniF2F benchmark based on the synthetic data.To provide further insights, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of synthetic data composition and the training paradigm, offering valuable guidance for developing a strong theorem prover.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in tasks involving tabular data, especially those requiring symbolic reasoning, faces challenges due to the structural variance and inconsistency in table cell values often found in web tables. In this paper, we introduce NormTab, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the symbolic reasoning performance of LLMs by normalizing web tables. We study table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on challenging web table datasets such as WikiTableQuestion and TabFact, demonstrates that leveraging NormTab significantly improves symbolic reasoning performance, showcasing the importance and effectiveness of web table normalization for enhancing LLM-based symbolic reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Proposition of Affordance-Driven Environment Recognition Framework Using Symbol Networks in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01644v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the quest to enable robots to coexist with humans, understanding dynamic situations and selecting appropriate actions based on common sense and affordances are essential. Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel CAD data annotation engine that leverages intrinsic attributes from systematically archived CAD drawings to automatically generate high-quality annotations, thus significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. Utilizing this engine, we construct ArchCAD-400K, a large-scale CAD dataset consisting of 413,062 chunks from 5538 highly standardized drawings, making it over 26 times larger than the largest existing CAD dataset. ArchCAD-400K boasts an extended drawing diversity and broader categories, offering line-grained annotations. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model for panoptic symbol spotting, termed Dual-Pathway Symbol Spotter (DPSS). It incorporates an adaptive fusion module to enhance primitive features with complementary image features, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DPSS, demonstrating the value of ArchCAD-400K and its potential to drive innovation in architectural design and construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Responsible and Trustworthy Educational Data Mining: Comparing Symbolic, Sub-Symbolic, and Neural-Symbolic AI Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00615v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the demand for responsible and trustworthy AI for education, this study evaluates symbolic, sub-symbolic, and neural-symbolic AI (NSAI) in terms of generalizability and interpretability. Our extensive experiments on balanced and imbalanced self-regulated learning datasets of Estonian primary school students predicting 7th-grade mathematics national test performance showed that symbolic and sub-symbolic methods performed well on balanced data but struggled to identify low performers in imbalanced datasets. Interestingly, symbolic and sub-symbolic methods emphasized different factors in their decision-making: symbolic approaches primarily relied on cognitive and motivational factors, while sub-symbolic methods focused more on cognitive aspects, learned knowledge, and the demographic variable of gender -- yet both largely overlooked metacognitive factors. The NSAI method, on the other hand, showed advantages by: (i) being more generalizable across both classes -- even in imbalanced datasets -- as its symbolic knowledge component compensated for the underrepresented class; and (ii) relying on a more integrated set of factors in its decision-making, including motivation, (meta)cognition, and learned knowledge, thus offering a comprehensive and theoretically grounded interpretability framework. These contrasting findings highlight the need for a holistic comparison of AI methods before drawing conclusions based solely on predictive performance. They also underscore the potential of hybrid, human-centered NSAI methods to address the limitations of other AI families and move us closer to responsible AI for education. Specifically, by enabling stakeholders to contribute to AI design, NSAI aligns learned patterns with theoretical constructs, incorporates factors like motivation and metacognition, and strengthens the trustworthiness and responsibility of educational data mining.</p></details> |  |

Holonomic and nonholonomic constraints affecting the kinematic behavior is investigated in order to develop control-oriented kinematic models representative of these peculiarities. Then, the structure of these constraints is exploited to develop an iterative algorithm to symbolically derive yaw-plane kinematic models of generalized $n$-trailer articulated vehicles with an arbitrary number of multi-axle vehicle units. A formal proof is provided for the maximum number of kinematic controls admissible to a large-scale generalized articulated vehicle system, which leads to a generalized Ackermann steering law for $n$-trailer systems. Moreover, kinematic data collected from a test vehicle is used to validate the kinematic models and, to understand the rearward yaw rate amplification behavior of the vehicle pulling multiple simulated trailers.</p></details> |  |

The primary use case for cozy is validating "micropatches": small binary or assembly-level patches inserted into existing compiled binaries. To perform this task, cozy leverages the Python-based angr symbolic execution framework. Our tool analyzes the output of symbolic execution to find end states for the pre- and post-patched binaries that are compatible (reachable from the same input). The tool then compares compatible states for observable differences in registers, memory, and side effects.

| **[Fast and Accurate Task Planning using Neuro-Symbolic Language Models and Multi-level Goal Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19250v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotic task planning, symbolic planners using rule-based representations like PDDL are effective but struggle with long-sequential tasks in complicated environments due to exponentially increasing search space. Meanwhile, LLM-based approaches, which are grounded in artificial neural networks, offer faster inference and commonsense reasoning but suffer from lower success rates. To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks. Our method significantly reduces planning time while maintaining high success rates across task planning domains, as well as real-world and simulated robotics environments. More details are available at http://graphics.ewha.ac.kr/LLMTAMP/.</p></details> |  |

However, applying counterfactual methods to time series models remains challenging due to temporal dependencies, high dimensionality, and the lack of an intuitive human-interpretable representation. We introduce MASCOTS, a method that leverages the Bag-of-Receptive-Fields representation alongside symbolic transformations inspired by Symbolic Aggregate Approximation. By operating in a symbolic feature space, it enhances interpretability while preserving fidelity to the original data and model. Unlike existing approaches that either depend on model structure or autoencoder-based sampling, MASCOTS directly generates meaningful and diverse counterfactual observations in a model-agnostic manner, operating on both univariate and multivariate data. We evaluate MASCOTS on univariate and multivariate benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable validity, proximity, and plausibility to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly improving interpretability and sparsity. Its symbolic nature allows for explanations that can be expressed visually, in natural language, or through semantic representations, making counterfactual reasoning more accessible and actionable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21406v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Automated reasoning, encompassing formal logic, theorem proving, model checking, and symbolic analysis, provides a foundational framework for verifying security properties across diverse domains such as access control, protocol design, vulnerability detection, and adversarial modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the role of automated reasoning in cybersecurity, analyzing how logical systems, including temporal, deontic, and epistemic logics are employed to formalize and verify security guarantees. We examine SOTA tools and frameworks, explore integrations with AI for neural-symbolic reasoning, and highlight critical research gaps, particularly in scalability, compositionality, and multi-layered security modeling. The paper concludes with a set of well-grounded future research directions, aiming to foster the development of secure systems through formal, automated, and explainable reasoning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20425v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[New constructions of MDS symbol-pair codes via simple-root cyclic codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20137v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern storage technologies, symbol-pair codes have emerged as a crucial framework for addressing errors in channels where symbols are read in overlapping pairs to guard against pair errors. A symbol-pair code that meets the Singleton-type bound is called a maximum distance separable (MDS) symbol-pair code. MDS symbol-pair codes are optimal in the sense that they have the highest pair error-correcting capability. In this paper, we focus on new constructions of MDS symbol-pair codes using simple-root cyclic codes. Specifically, three new infinite families of $(n, d_P)_q$-MDS symbol-pair codes are obtained: (1) $(n=4q+4,d_P=7)_q$ for $q\equiv 1\pmod 4$; (2) $(n=4q-4,d_P=8)_q$ for $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$; (3) $(n=2q+2,d_P=9)_q$ for $q$ being an odd prime power. The first two constructions are based on analyzing the solutions of certain equations over finite fields. The third construction arises from the decomposition of cyclic codes, where we utilize the orthogonal relationships between component codes and their duals to rigorously exclude the presence of specific codewords. It is worth noting that for the pair distance $d_P=7$ or $8$, our $q$-ary MDS symbol-pair codes achieve the longest known code length when $q$ is not a prime. Furthermore, for $d_P=9$, our codes attain the longest code length regardless of whether $q$ is prime or not.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Probabilistic Neuro-symbolic Layer for Algebraic Constraint Satisfaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19466v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.</p></details> |  |

Our method focuses on exact symbolic recovery of known expressions from datasets, with a particular emphasis on the Feynman-AI benchmark. On this widely used collection of 117 physics equations, QDSR achieves an exact recovery rate of 91.6~$\%$, surpassing all previous SR methods by over 20 percentage points. Our method also exhibits strong robustness to noise. Beyond QD and DA, this high success rate results from a profitable trade-off between vocabulary expressiveness and search space size: we show that significantly expanding the vocabulary with precomputed meaningful variables (e.g., dimensionless combinations and well-chosen scalar products) often reduces equation complexity, ultimately leading to better performance. Ablation studies will also show that QD alone already outperforms the state-of-the-art. This suggests that a simple integration of QD, by projecting individuals onto a QD grid, can significantly boost performance in existing algorithms, without requiring major system overhauls.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Journal of Machine Learning research</p></details> |

The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%). The code will be released soon.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Neuro-symbolic Weak Supervision: Theory and Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18509v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak supervision allows machine learning models to learn from limited or noisy labels, but it introduces challenges in interpretability and reliability - particularly in multi-instance partial label learning (MI-PLL), where models must resolve both ambiguous labels and uncertain instance-label mappings. We propose a semantics for neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to improve MI-PLL by providing structured relational constraints that guide learning. Within our semantic characterization, ILP defines a logical hypothesis space for label transitions, clarifies classifier semantics, and establishes interpretable performance standards. This hybrid approach improves robustness, transparency, and accountability in weakly supervised settings, ensuring neural predictions align with domain knowledge. By embedding weak supervision into a logical framework, we enhance both interpretability and learning, making weak supervision more suitable for real-world, high-stakes applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study on Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence: Healthcare Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18213v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) scientists have been conducting investigations to attain human-level performance by a machine in accomplishing a cognitive task. Within machine learning, the ultimate aspiration is to attain Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a machine. This pursuit has led to the exploration of two distinct AI paradigms. Symbolic AI, also known as classical or GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) and Connectionist (Sub-symbolic) AI, represented by Neural Systems, are two mutually exclusive paradigms. Symbolic AI excels in reasoning, explainability, and knowledge representation but faces challenges in processing complex real-world data with noise. Conversely, deep learning (Black-Box systems) research breakthroughs in neural networks are notable, yet they lack reasoning and interpretability. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), an emerging area of AI research, attempts to bridge this gap by integrating logical reasoning into neural networks, enabling them to learn and reason with symbolic representations. While a long path, this strategy has made significant progress towards achieving common sense reasoning by systems. This article conducts an extensive review of over 977 studies from prominent scientific databases (DBLP, ACL, IEEExplore, Scopus, PubMed, ICML, ICLR), thoroughly examining the multifaceted capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular focus on its healthcare applications, particularly in drug discovery, and Protein engineering research. The survey addresses vital themes, including reasoning, explainability, integration strategies, 41 healthcare-related use cases, benchmarking, datasets, current approach limitations from both healthcare and broader perspectives, and proposed novel approaches for future experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages |

While these approaches achieve high-quality results, they require substantial computational resources, limiting their scalability. We introduce LZMidi, a lightweight symbolic music generation framework based on a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78)-induced sequential probability assignment (SPA). By leveraging the discrete and sequential structure of MIDI data, our approach enables efficient music generation on standard CPUs with minimal training and inference costs. Theoretically, we establish universal convergence guarantees for our approach, underscoring its reliability and robustness. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models, LZMidi achieves competitive Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), Wasserstein Distance (WD), and Kullback-Leibler (KL) scores, while significantly reducing computational overhead - up to 30x faster training and 300x faster generation. Our results position LZMidi as a significant advancement in compression-based learning, highlighting how universal compression techniques can efficiently model and generate structured sequential data, such as symbolic music, with practical scalability and theoretical rigor.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Scene Graph Conditioning for Synthetic Image Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17224v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models increase in scale and complexity, obtaining sufficient training data has become a critical bottleneck due to acquisition costs, privacy constraints, and data scarcity in specialised domains. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative, a notable performance gap remains compared to models trained on real data, particularly as task complexity grows. Concurrently, Neuro-Symbolic methods, which combine neural networks' learning strengths with symbolic reasoning's structured representations, have demonstrated significant potential across various cognitive tasks. This paper explores the utility of Neuro-Symbolic conditioning for synthetic image dataset generation, focusing specifically on improving the performance of Scene Graph Generation models. The research investigates whether structured symbolic representations in the form of scene graphs can enhance synthetic data quality through explicit encoding of relational constraints. The results demonstrate that Neuro-Symbolic conditioning yields significant improvements of up to +2.59% in standard Recall metrics and +2.83% in No Graph Constraint Recall metrics when used for dataset augmentation. These findings establish that merging Neuro-Symbolic and generative approaches produces synthetic data with complementary structural information that enhances model performance when combined with real data, providing a novel approach to overcome data scarcity limitations even for complex visual reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music in ABC notation, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |

Classification of sounds, in particular, is a typical machine learning task that received a lot of attention in recent years. The most common approaches to sound classification are sub-symbolic, typically based on neural networks, and result in black-box models with high performances but very low transparency. In this work, we consider several audio tasks, namely, age and gender recognition, emotion classification, and respiratory disease diagnosis, and we approach them with a symbolic technique, that is, (modal) decision tree learning. We prove that such tasks can be solved using the same symbolic pipeline, that allows to extract simple rules with very high accuracy and low complexity. In principle, all such tasks could be associated to an autonomous conversation system, which could be useful in different contexts, such as an automatic reservation agent for an hospital or a clinic.</p></details> |  |

We show that the learnability of NeSy tasks can be characterized by their derived constraint satisfaction problems (DCSPs). Specifically, a task is learnable if the corresponding DCSP has a unique solution; otherwise, it is unlearnable. For learnable tasks, we establish error bounds by exploiting the clustering property of the hypothesis space. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic error for general NeSy tasks, showing that the expected error scales with the disagreement among solutions. Our results offer a principled approach to determining learnability and provide insights into the design of new algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextGPT: Infusing LLMs Knowledge into Neuro-Symbolic Activity Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06586v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a hot research area in mobile computing, and the most effective solutions in the literature are based on supervised deep learning models. However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise. An extensive evaluation carried out on two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-based Wireless Symbol Detection Over Fading Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16594v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts without model update. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose the DEcision Feedback INcontExt Detection (DEFINED) solution as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. Furthermore, we proposed another detection method where we combine ICL with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) to extract information from both labeled and unlabeled data during inference, thus avoiding the errors propagated during the decision feedback process of the original DEFINED. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless communication settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED or IC-SSL achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance of the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.07600</p></details> |

Fault attacks leverage physically injected hardware faults to break the safety of a software program. While there are existing methods for analyzing the impact of faults on software, they suffer from inaccurate fault modeling and inefficient analysis algorithms. We propose two new techniques to overcome these problems. First, we propose a fault modeling technique that leverages program transformation to add symbolic variables to the program, to accurately model the fault-induced program behavior. Second, we propose a redundancy pruning technique that leverages the weakest precondition and fault saturation to mitigate path explosion, which is a performance bottleneck of symbolic execution that is exacerbated by the fault-induced program behavior. We have implemented the method and evaluated it on a variety of benchmark programs. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, it not only reveals many previously-missed safety violations but also reduces the running time drastically. Compared to the baseline, our optimized method is 2.0$\times$ faster on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Performance Analysis of Lexicase-Based and Traditional Selection Methods in GP for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21632v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, several new lexicase-based selection variants have emerged due to the success of standard lexicase selection in various application domains. For symbolic regression problems, variants that use an epsilon-threshold or batches of training cases, among others, have led to performance improvements. Lately, especially variants that combine lexicase selection and down-sampling strategies have received a lot of attention. This paper evaluates the most relevant lexicase-based selection methods as well as traditional selection methods in combination with different down-sampling strategies on a wide range of symbolic regression problems. In contrast to most work, we not only compare the methods over a given evaluation budget, but also over a given time budget as time is usually limited in practice. We find that for a given evaluation budget, epsilon-lexicase selection in combination with a down-sampling strategy outperforms all other methods. If the given running time is very short, lexicase variants using batches of training cases perform best. Further, we find that the combination of tournament selection with informed down-sampling performs well in all studied settings.</p></details> |  |

Although gaps can sometimes be narrowed by techniques such as refinement, a verified program's trusted computing base may still include compilers and inlined assembly. In contrast, verification of binaries following an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) such as RISC-V can ensure that machine code behaves as expected on real hardware. While binary analysis is useful and sometimes even necessary for ensuring trustworthiness of software systems, existing tools do not have a formal foundation or lack automation for verification. We present a workflow and toolchain based on the HOL4 theorem prover and the HolBA binary analysis library for trustworthy formal verification of RISC-V binaries. The toolchain automates proofs of binary contracts by forward symbolic execution of programs in HolBA's intermediate language, BIR. We validated our toolchain by verifying correctness of RISC-V binaries with (1) an implementation of the ChaCha20 stream cipher and (2) hand-written assembly for context switching in an operating system kernel.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We propose a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones. Furthermore, the proposed metrics are consistent with human evaluations.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Traditionally, sperm whale populations are categorized into clans based on their vocal repertoire: the rhythmically patterned click sequences (codas) that they use. Among these codas, identity codas function as symbolic markers for each clan, accounting for 35-60% of codas they produce. We introduce a computational method to model whale speech, which encodes rhythmic micro-variations within codas, capturing their vocal style. We find that vocal style-clans closely align with repertoire-clans. However, contrary to vocal repertoire, we show that sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, i.e. most codas, suggesting social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, this subcoda structure model offers a framework for comparing communication systems in other species, with potential implications for deeper understanding of vocal and cultural transmission within animal societies.</p></details> |  |

Most of existing algorithms in symbolic summation are mainly applicable to the problem with univariate inputs. A long-term project in symbolic computation is to develop theories, algorithms and software for the symbolic summation of multivariate functions. This paper will give complete solutions to two challenging problems in symbolic summation of multivariate rational functions, namely the rational summability problem and the existence problem of telescopers for multivariate rational functions. Our approach is based on the structure of Sato's isotropy groups of polynomials, which enables us to reduce the problems to testing the shift equivalence of polynomials. Our results provide a complete solution to the discrete analogue of Picard's problem on differential forms and can be used to detect the applicability of the Wilf-Zeilberger method to multivariate rational functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, to appear in Foundations of Computational Mathematics</p></details> |

If we completely disregard labels, it leads to less symbol information, a larger solution space, and more shortcuts-issues that current Nesy systems cannot resolve. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Verification Learning (VL), which addresses this challenge by transforming the label-based reasoning process in Nesy into a label-free verification process. VL achieves excellent learning results solely by relying on unlabeled data and a function that verifies whether the current predictions conform to the rules. We formalize this problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) and propose a Dynamic combinatorial Sorting (DCS) algorithm that accelerates the solution by reducing verification attempts, effectively lowering computational costs to the level of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). To further enhance performance, we introduce a prior alignment method to address potential shortcuts. Our theoretical analysis points out which tasks in Nesy systems can be completed without labels and explains why rules can replace infinite labels, such as in addition, for some tasks, while for others, like Sudoku, the rules have no effect. We validate the proposed framework through several fully unsupervised tasks including addition, sort, match, and chess, each showing significant performance and efficiency improvements.</p></details> |  |

Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality.

A primary challenge in continual learning is to learn new tasks without losing previously learned knowledge. Current continual learning methods primarily focus on enabling a neural network with mechanisms that mitigate forgetting effects. Inspired by the two distinct systems in the human brain, System 1 and System 2, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Brain-Inspired Continual Learning (NeSyBiCL) framework that incorporates two subsystems to solve continual learning: A neural network model responsible for quickly adapting to the most recent task, together with a symbolic reasoner responsible for retaining previously acquired knowledge from previous tasks. Moreover, we design an integration mechanism between these components to facilitate knowledge transfer from the symbolic reasoner to the neural network. We also introduce two compositional continual learning benchmarks and demonstrate that NeSyBiCL is effective and leads to superior performance compared to continual learning methods that merely rely on neural architectures to address forgetting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Vector Optimization on Low-Dimensional Vector Symbolic Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14075v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) is emerging in machine learning due to its efficiency, but they are hindered by issues of hyperdimensionality and accuracy. As a promising mitigation, the Low-Dimensional Computing (LDC) method significantly reduces the vector dimension by ~100 times while maintaining accuracy, by employing a gradient-based optimization. Despite its potential, LDC optimization for VSA is still underexplored. Our investigation into vector updates underscores the importance of stable, adaptive dynamics in LDC training. We also reveal the overlooked yet critical roles of batch normalization (BN) and knowledge distillation (KD) in standard approaches. Besides the accuracy boost, BN does not add computational overhead during inference, and KD significantly enhances inference confidence. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across multiple benchmarks, we provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and extend the interpretability of binary neural network optimization similar to LDC, previously unaddressed in BNN literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

Existing approaches struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with attributes like coordinates and colors, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large, complex drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique, combining weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale CAD dataset to support our experiments, with each floorplan covering around 1,000 square meters, significantly larger than previous benchmarks. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD datasets show that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also demonstrate its practical value through automating parametric 3D reconstruction, enabling interior modeling directly from raw CAD inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 14 figures, Project web-page: https://dgeneai.github.io/cadspotting-pages/</p></details> |

High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps). Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks. Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects. In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method. Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences. We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects. Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations. This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%. We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results. We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Equations to Insights: Unraveling Symbolic Structures in PDEs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09986v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse fields, the application of AI to solve scientific problems-often formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs)-has garnered increasing attention. While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the finite expression method for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an advanced symbolic regression method that integrates symbol priors from diverse scientific domains - including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering - into the regression process. By systematically analyzing domain-specific expressions, we derive probability distributions of symbols to guide expression generation. We propose novel tree-structured recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverage these symbol priors, enabling domain knowledge to steer the learning process. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical tree structure for representing expressions, where unary and binary operators are organized to facilitate more efficient learning. To further accelerate training, we compile characteristic expression blocks from each domain and include them in the operator dictionary, providing relevant building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging symbol priors significantly enhances the performance of symbolic regression, resulting in faster convergence and higher accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Context Learning and Reasoning for Symbolic Regression with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17448v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based machine learning models that have shown remarkable performance in tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. Here, we explore the potential of LLMs to perform symbolic regression -- a machine-learning method for finding simple and accurate equations from datasets. We prompt GPT-4 to suggest expressions from data, which are then optimized and evaluated using external Python tools. These results are fed back to GPT-4, which proposes improved expressions while optimizing for complexity and loss. Using chain-of-thought prompting, we instruct GPT-4 to analyze the data, prior expressions, and the scientific context (expressed in natural language) for each problem before generating new expressions. We evaluated the workflow in rediscovery of five well-known scientific equations from experimental data, and on an additional dataset without a known equation. GPT-4 successfully rediscovered all five equations, and in general, performed better when prompted to use a scratchpad and consider scientific context. We demonstrate how strategic prompting improves the model's performance and how the natural language interface simplifies integrating theory with data. We also observe how theory can sometimes offset noisy data and, in other cases, data can make up for poor context. Although this approach does not outperform established SR programs where target equations are more complex, LLMs can nonetheless iterate toward improved solutions while following instructions and incorporating scientific context in natural language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

In the absence of a specification for the input language, common test generation techniques rely on sample inputs, which are abstracted into matching grammars and/or evolved guided by test coverage. However, if sample inputs miss features of the input language, the chances of generating these features randomly are slim. In this work, we present the first technique for symbolically and automatically mining input grammars from the code of recursive descent parsers. So far, the complexity of parsers has made such a symbolic analysis challenging to impossible. Our realization of the symbolic parsing technique overcomes these challenges by (1) associating each parser function parse_ELEM() with a nonterminal <ELEM>; (2) limiting recursive calls and loop iterations, such that a symbolic analysis of parse_ELEM() needs to consider only a finite number of paths; and (3) for each path, create an expansion alternative for <ELEM>. Being purely static, symbolic parsing does not require seed inputs; as it mitigates path explosion, it scales to complex parsers. Our evaluation promises symbolic parsing to be highly accurate. Applied on parsers for complex languages such as TINY-C or JSON, our STALAGMITE implementation extracts grammars with an accuracy of 99--100%, widely improving over the state of the art despite requiring only the program code and no input samples. The resulting grammars cover the entire input space, allowing for comprehensive and effective test generation, reverse engineering, and documentation.</p></details> |  |

Effectively learning a family of maps from the parameter function to the system dynamics is of great significance. In this study, we propose a novel learning framework of symbolic continuous-depth neural networks, termed Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (SNODEs), to effectively and accurately learn the underlying dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, our learning framework comprises three stages: initially, pre-training a predefined symbolic neural network via a gradient flow matching strategy; subsequently, fine-tuning this network using Neural ODEs; and finally, constructing a general neural network to capture residuals. In this process, we apply the SNODEs framework to partial differential equation systems through Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling. Moreover, this framework integrates the strengths of symbolism and connectionism, boasting a universal approximation theorem while significantly enhancing interpretability and extrapolation capabilities relative to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We demonstrate this through experiments on several representative complex systems. Therefore, our framework can be further applied to a wide range of scientific problems, such as system bifurcation and control, reconstruction and forecasting, as well as the discovery of new equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2025</p></details> |

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance.

Traditional methods, such as fixed-form parametric models and data-driven approaches, often struggle to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel symbolic regression algorithm based on the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored for dynamic load modeling. The algorithm employs a trainable expression tree with controlled depth and a predefined set of operators to generate compact and interpretable mathematical expressions. The Actor network probabilistically selects operators for the symbolic expression, while the Critic evaluates the resulting expression tree through a loss function. To further enhance performance, a candidate pool mechanism is implemented to store high-performing expressions, which are subsequently fine-tuned using gradient descent. By focusing on simplicity and precision, the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving interpretability. Experimental results validate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, which offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic load modeling and system analysis in modern power systems.</p></details> | 9pages |

This work employs deep symbolic regression as an interpretable machine learning approach to discover novel strain energy functions directly from experimental results, with a specific focus on the classical Treloar and Kawabata data sets for vulcanized rubber. The proposed approach circumvents traditional human model selection biases by exploring possible functional forms of strain energy functions, expressed in terms of both the first and second principal invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. The resulting models exhibit high predictive accuracy for various deformation modes, including uniaxial tension, pure shear, equal biaxial tension, and biaxial loading. This work underscores the potential of deep symbolic regression in advancing hyperelastic material modeling and highlights the importance of considering both invariants in capturing the complex behaviors of rubber-like materials.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge for embodied agents is the generalization of knowledge across diverse environments and situations, as limited experiences often confine them to their prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, NeSyC, a neuro-symbolic continual learner that emulates the hypothetico-deductive model by continually formulating and validating knowledge from limited experiences through the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic tools. Specifically, we devise a contrastive generality improvement scheme within NeSyC, which iteratively generates hypotheses using LLMs and conducts contrastive validation via symbolic tools. This scheme reinforces the justification for admissible actions while minimizing the inference of inadmissible ones. Additionally, we incorporate a memory-based monitoring scheme that efficiently detects action errors and triggers the knowledge refinement process across domains.

| **[VQEL: Enabling Self-Developed Symbolic Language in Agents through Vector Quantization in Emergent Language Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04940v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of emergent language, efforts have traditionally focused on developing communication protocols through interactions between agents in referential games. However, the aspect of internal language learning, where language serves not only as a communicative tool with others but also as a means for individual thinking, self-reflection, and problem-solving remains underexplored. Developing a language through self-play, without another agent's involvement, poses a unique challenge. It requires an agent to craft symbolic representations and train them using direct gradient methods. The challenge here is that if an agent attempts to learn symbolic representations through self-play using conventional modeling and techniques such as REINFORCE, the solution will offer no advantage over previous multi-agent approaches. We introduce VQEL, a novel method that incorporates Vector Quantization into the agents' architecture, enabling them to autonomously invent and develop discrete symbolic representations in a self-play referential game. Following the self-play phase, agents can enhance their language through reinforcement learning and interactions with other agents in the mutual-play phase. Our experiments across various datasets demonstrate that VQEL not only outperforms the traditional REINFORCE method but also benefits from improved control and reduced susceptibility to collapse, thanks to the incorporation of vector quantization.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by how language abstracts and organizes information to enable better reasoning and generalization, we propose a novel approach for generating symbolic representations from visual data. To learn these sequences, we extend the DINO framework to handle visual and symbolic information. Initial experiments suggest that the generated symbolic sequences capture a meaningful level of abstraction, though further refinement is required. An advantage of our method is its interpretability: the sequences are produced by a decoder transformer using cross-attention, allowing attention maps to be linked to specific symbols and offering insight into how these representations correspond to image regions. This approach lays the foundation for creating interpretable symbolic representations with potential applications in high-level scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural DNF-MT: A Neuro-symbolic Approach for Learning Interpretable and Editable Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03888v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective, the model's black-box nature presents barriers to direct policy interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAMAS...</summary><p>AAMAS 2025 (with Appendix)</p></details> |
| **[From Metaphor to Mechanism: How LLMs Decode Traditional Chinese Medicine Symbolic Language for Modern Clinical Relevance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02760v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metaphorical expressions are abundant in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), conveying complex disease mechanisms and holistic health concepts through culturally rich and often abstract terminology. Bridging these metaphors to anatomically driven Western medical (WM) concepts poses significant challenges for both automated language processing and real-world clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-agent and chain-of-thought (CoT) framework designed to interpret TCM metaphors accurately and map them to WM pathophysiology. Specifically, our approach combines domain-specialized agents (TCM Expert, WM Expert) with a Coordinator Agent, leveraging stepwise chain-of-thought prompts to ensure transparent reasoning and conflict resolution. We detail a methodology for building a metaphor-rich TCM dataset, discuss strategies for effectively integrating multi-agent collaboration and CoT reasoning, and articulate the theoretical underpinnings that guide metaphor interpretation across distinct medical paradigms. We present a comprehensive system design and highlight both the potential benefits and limitations of our approach, while leaving placeholders for future experimental validation. Our work aims to support clinical decision-making, cross-system educational initiatives, and integrated healthcare research, ultimately offering a robust scaffold for reconciling TCM's symbolic language with the mechanistic focus of Western medicine.</p></details> |  |

Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

| **[SymbolFit: Automatic Parametric Modeling with Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09851v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SymbolFit, a framework that automates parametric modeling by using symbolic regression to perform a machine-search for functions that fit the data while simultaneously providing uncertainty estimates in a single run. Traditionally, constructing a parametric model to accurately describe binned data has been a manual and iterative process, requiring an adequate functional form to be determined before the fit can be performed. The main challenge arises when the appropriate functional forms cannot be derived from first principles, especially when there is no underlying true closed-form function for the distribution. In this work, we develop a framework that automates and streamlines the process by utilizing symbolic regression, a machine learning technique that explores a vast space of candidate functions without requiring a predefined functional form because the functional form itself is treated as a trainable parameter, making the process far more efficient and effortless than traditional regression methods. We demonstrate the framework in high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using five real proton-proton collision datasets from new physics searches, including background modeling in resonance searches for high-mass dijet, trijet, paired-dijet, diphoton, and dimuon events. We show that our framework can flexibly and efficiently generate a wide range of candidate functions that fit a nontrivial distribution well using a simple fit configuration that varies only by random seed, and that the same fit configuration, which defines a vast function space, can also be applied to distributions of different shapes, whereas achieving a comparable result with traditional methods would have required extensive manual effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 35 figures.

Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

| **[Symmetry-based Abstraction Algorithm for Accelerating Symbolic Control Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11816v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient symbolic control synthesis algorithm for equivariant continuous-time dynamical systems to satisfy reach-avoid specifications. The algorithm exploits dynamical symmetries to construct lean abstractions to avoid redundant computations during synthesis. Our proposed algorithm adds another layer of abstraction over the common grid-based discrete abstraction before solving the synthesis problem. It combines each set of grid cells that are at a similar relative position from the targets and nearby obstacles, defined by the symmetries, into a single abstract state. It uses this layer of abstraction to guide the order by which actions are explored during synthesis over the grid-based abstraction. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by synthesizing a reach-avoid controller for a 3-dimensional ship model with translation and rotation symmetries in the special Euclidean group SE(2).</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has shown promise in brain MRI analysis, it often functions as a black box, limiting interpretability and lacking mechanisms to effectively integrate critical clinical data such as biomarkers, medical history, and demographic information. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuroSymAD, a neuro-symbolic framework that synergizes neural networks with symbolic reasoning. A neural network percepts brain MRI scans, while a large language model (LLM) distills medical rules to guide a symbolic system in reasoning over biomarkers and medical history. This structured integration enhances both diagnostic accuracy and explainability. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that NeuroSymAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.91% in accuracy and 3.43% in F1-score while providing transparent and interpretable diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

We outline an online algorithm for inventing such predicates and learning abstract world models. We compare our approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, vision-language model planning, and symbolic predicate invention approaches, on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks across five simulated robotic domains. Results show that our approach offers better sample complexity, stronger out-of-distribution generalization, and improved interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.</p></details> | Submitted to NeuS'25 |

By combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning we develop a model that outperforms purely numerical methods in accuracy and interpretability. Focusing on sextic polynomials with height $\leq 6$, we analyze a database of 53,972 irreducible examples, uncovering novel distributional trends, such as the 20 sextic polynomials with Galois group $C_6$ spanning just seven invariant-defined equivalence classes. These findings offer the first empirical insights into Galois group probabilities under height constraints and lay the groundwork for exploring solvability by radicals. Demonstrating AI's potential to reveal patterns beyond traditional symbolic techniques, this work paves the way for future research in computational algebra, with implications for probabilistic conjectures and higher degree classifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic regression via MDLformer-guided search: from minimizing prediction error to minimizing description length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03753v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression, a task discovering the formula best fitting the given data, is typically based on the heuristical search. These methods usually update candidate formulas to obtain new ones with lower prediction errors iteratively.However, since formulas with similar function shapes may have completely different symbolic forms, the prediction error does not decrease monotonously as the search approaches the target formula, causing the low recovery rate of existing methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel search objective based on the minimum description length, which reflects the distance from the target and decreases monotonically as the search approaches the correct form of the target formula. To estimate the minimum description length of any input data, we design a neural network, MDLformer, which enables robust and scalable estimation through large-scale training. With the MDLformer's output as the search objective, we implement a symbolic regression method, SR4MDL, that can effectively recover the correct mathematical form of the formula. Extensive experiments illustrate its excellent performance in recovering formulas from data. Our method successfully recovers around 50 formulas across two benchmark datasets comprising 133 problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 43.92%. Experiments on 122 unseen black-box problems further demonstrate its generalization performance. We release our code at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SR4MDL .</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the computational principles of canonical cortical microcircuits, we propose a framework for using recurrent spiking neural networks to seamlessly and robustly switch between analog signal processing and categorical and discrete computation. We provide theoretical analysis and practical neural network design tools to formally determine the conditions for inducing this switch. We demonstrate the robustness of this framework experimentally with hardware soft Winner-Take-All and mixed-feedback recurrent spiking neural networks, implemented by appropriately configuring the analog neuron and synapse circuits of a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor chip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20332v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have found evidence for emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models, but debate persists concerning the robustness of these capabilities, and the extent to which they depend on structured reasoning mechanisms. To shed light on these issues, we perform a comprehensive study of the internal mechanisms that support abstract rule induction in an open-source language model (Llama3-70B). We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, the space of possible tactics is vast and complex, while the available training data for formal proofs is limited, posing a significant challenge to LLM-based tactic generation. To address this, we introduce a neuro-symbolic tactic generator that synergizes the mathematical intuition learned by LLMs with domain-specific insights encoded by symbolic methods. The key aspect of this integration is identifying which parts of mathematical reasoning are best suited to LLMs and which to symbolic methods. While the high-level idea of neuro-symbolic integration is broadly applicable to various mathematical problems, in this paper, we focus specifically on Olympiad inequalities (Figure~1). We analyze how humans solve these problems and distill the techniques into two types of tactics: (1) scaling, handled by symbolic methods, and (2) rewriting, handled by LLMs. In addition, we combine symbolic tools with LLMs to prune and rank the proof goals for efficient proof search. We evaluate our framework on 161 challenging inequalities from multiple mathematics competitions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforming existing LLM and symbolic approaches without requiring additional training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

While natural language offers human-accessible flexibility but suffers from ambiguity, symbolic reasoning provides precise, machine-executable inferences at the cost of strict domain constraints. We introduce HYBRIDMIND, an adaptive strategy that selects the optimal reasoning approach for each reasoning problem. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate both prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned open-source models. We find that fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct as a meta-selector outperforms GPT-4o's natural language reasoning by 4.4\% on FOLIO and 1.3\% on MATH. More notably, using GPT-3.5-turbo as a prompted meta-selector yields a 10\% improvement on FOLIO's challenging subset compared to GPT-4o.

One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation. However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR. These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data. Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data. As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods. We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in GECCO '24</p></details> |

Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more.

One promising approach to achieving this is through neural-symbolic systems, which combine the strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning. However, current methodologies in this area face limitations in integration, generalization, and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a neural-symbolic framework based on statistical relational learning, referred to as NSF-SRL. This framework effectively integrates deep learning models with symbolic reasoning in a mutually beneficial manner.In NSF-SRL, the results of symbolic reasoning are utilized to refine and correct the predictions made by deep learning models, while deep learning models enhance the efficiency of the symbolic reasoning process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance and exhibits effective generalization in supervised learning, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative strategy to evaluate the interpretability of the model's predictions, visualizing the corresponding logic rules that contribute to these predictions and providing insights into the reasoning process. We believe that this approach sets a new standard for neural-symbolic systems and will drive future research in the field of general artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Reasoning refers to drawing new conclusions based on existing knowledge, which can support various applications like clinical diagnosis, basic education, and financial analysis. Though a good number of surveys have been proposed for reviewing reasoning-related methods, none of them has systematically investigated these methods from the viewpoint of their dependent knowledge base. Both the scenarios to which the knowledge bases are applied and their storage formats are significantly different. Hence, investigating reasoning methods from the knowledge base perspective helps us better understand the challenges and future directions. To fill this gap, this paper first classifies the knowledge base into symbolic and parametric ones. The former explicitly stores information in human-readable symbols, and the latter implicitly encodes knowledge within parameters. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of reasoning methods using symbolic knowledge bases, parametric knowledge bases, and both of them.

Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.</p></details> |  |

While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high cost of 3D vision-language datasets. On the other hand, LLM/VLM based agents are proposed for 3DVG, eliminating the need for training data. However, these methods incur prohibitive time and token costs during inference. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel training-free symbolic framework for 3D visual grounding, namely Evolvable Symbolic Visual Grounder, that offers significantly reduced inference costs compared to previous agent-based methods while maintaining comparable performance. EaSe uses LLM generated codes to compute on spatial relationships. EaSe also implements an automatic pipeline to evaluate and optimize the quality of these codes and integrate VLMs to assist in the grounding process. Experimental results demonstrate that EaSe achieves 52.9% accuracy on Nr3D dataset and 49.2% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer, which is top-tier among training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the inference time and cost, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system.

| **[Learning Symbolic Task Decompositions for Multi-Agent Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13376v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One approach for improving sample efficiency in cooperative multi-agent learning is to decompose overall tasks into sub-tasks that can be assigned to individual agents. We study this problem in the context of reward machines: symbolic tasks that can be formally decomposed into sub-tasks. In order to handle settings without a priori knowledge of the environment, we introduce a framework that can learn the optimal decomposition from model-free interactions with the environment. Our method uses a task-conditioned architecture to simultaneously learn an optimal decomposition and the corresponding agents' policies for each sub-task. In doing so, we remove the need for a human to manually design the optimal decomposition while maintaining the sample-efficiency benefits of improved credit assignment. We provide experimental results in several deep reinforcement learning settings, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Our results indicate that our approach succeeds even in environments with codependent agent dynamics, enabling synchronous multi-agent learning not achievable in previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, main track full paper at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural-Symbolic Collaborative Distillation: Advancing Small Language Models for Complex Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13203v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose $\textbf{Ne}$ural-$\textbf{Sy}$mbolic $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{D}$istillation ($\textbf{NesyCD}$), a novel knowledge distillation method for learning the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., \textgreater 13B). We argue that complex reasoning tasks are difficult for Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 7B), as these tasks demand not only general cognitive abilities but also specialized knowledge, which is often sparse and difficult for these neural-based SLMs to effectively capture. Therefore, NesyCD distills the general capabilities and specialized knowledge in LLMs using different manners. On the one hand, we distill only general abilities from teacher LLMs into the student SLMs of parameterized neural networks. On the other hand, for the specialized abilities and uncommon knowledge of a complex reasoning task, we employ a symbolic knowledge distillation approach to obtain and store the specialized knowledge within a symbolic knowledge base (KB). By decoupling general and specialized capabilities, the proposed NesyCD can achieve superior performance cost-effectively, utilizing smaller models and blending parameterized neural networks with symbolic KB. Moreover, the specialized KB generalizes well and is comprehended and manipulated by humans. Our experiments show that NesyCD significantly boosts SLMs' complex reasoning performance on in-domain (BBH, GSM8K) and out-of-domain (AGIEval, ARC) datasets. Notably, our approach enabled the LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B to surpass GPT-3.5-turbo in performance and come close to matching LLaMA3-70B, despite the latter having nine times more parameters. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/NesyCD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, achieving human-like reasoning and interpretability in AI systems remains a substantial challenge. The Neural-Symbolic paradigm, which integrates neural networks with symbolic systems, presents a promising pathway toward more interpretable AI. Within this paradigm, Knowledge Graphs (KG) are crucial, offering a structured and dynamic method for representing knowledge through interconnected entities and relationships, typically as triples (subject, predicate, object). This paper explores recent advancements in neural-symbolic integration based on KG, examining how it supports integration in three categories: enhancing the reasoning and interpretability of neural networks with symbolic knowledge (Symbol for Neural), refining the completeness and accuracy of symbolic systems via neural network methodologies (Neural for Symbol), and facilitating their combined application in Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Integration. It highlights current trends and proposes future research directions in Neural-Symbolic AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Smooth Transition Between Induction and Deduction: Fast Abductive Learning Based on Probabilistic Symbol Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12919v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive learning (ABL) that integrates strengths of machine learning and logical reasoning to improve the learning generalization, has been recently shown effective. However, its efficiency is affected by the transition between numerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computational costs in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited. In this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithms for ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbol relationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes, resulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address these challenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as Probabilistic Symbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction and deduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged. We leverage probability as a bridge and present an efficient data structure, achieving the transfer from a continuous probability sequence to discrete Boolean sequences with low computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate the promising results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |

OBDDs allow for efficient algorithms using top-down dynamic programming. From an automata-theoretic perspective, OBDDs essentially are minimal deterministic finite automata recognizing languages whose words have a fixed length (the arity of the Boolean function). We introduce weakly acyclic diagrams (WADs), a generalization of OBDDs that maintains their algorithmic advantages, but can also represent infinite languages. We develop the theory of WADs and show that they can be used for symbolic model checking of various models of infinite-state systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version of TACAS'25 with appendix and link to artifact</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort, RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 1 table. Technical Report</p></details> |

Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these puzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving capabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and analyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including the number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training: SFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT). While both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they exhibit limited generalization to unseen ones. We will release VGRP-Bench to facilitate further research on LVLMs for complex, real-world problem-solving.

| **[Adaptive Rectification Sampling for Test-Time Compute Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01317v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chain of thoughts (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicate that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report (In Progress); Code released at: https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Bench-R1</p></details> |
| **[Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuestBench: Can LLMs ask the right question to acquire information in reasoning tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22674v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a large amount of work has focused on improving large language models' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic. However, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real world, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through acquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this formalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can rigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states that are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math problems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of GSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators. The LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a list of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their accuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient for success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right question to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the problem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even when explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This highlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information acquisition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/google-deepmind/questbench}</p></details> |

Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial challenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored. We construct two multilingual natural language inference (NLI) datasets with \textit{paired} examples differing in negation. We investigate how model size and language impact its ability to handle negation correctly by evaluating popular LLMs. Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size consistently improves the models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the models' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent and that the length and explicitness of the premise have a greater impact on robustness than language. Our datasets can facilitate further research and improvements of language model reasoning in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaMOuR: Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125v5)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

| **[ShieldAgent: Shielding Agents via Verifiable Safety Policy Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22738v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption across various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.</p></details> |  |

Within machine learning, the ultimate aspiration is to attain Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a machine. This pursuit has led to the exploration of two distinct AI paradigms. Symbolic AI, also known as classical or GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) and Connectionist (Sub-symbolic) AI, represented by Neural Systems, are two mutually exclusive paradigms. Symbolic AI excels in reasoning, explainability, and knowledge representation but faces challenges in processing complex real-world data with noise. Conversely, deep learning (Black-Box systems) research breakthroughs in neural networks are notable, yet they lack reasoning and interpretability. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), an emerging area of AI research, attempts to bridge this gap by integrating logical reasoning into neural networks, enabling them to learn and reason with symbolic representations. While a long path, this strategy has made significant progress towards achieving common sense reasoning by systems. This article conducts an extensive review of over 977 studies from prominent scientific databases (DBLP, ACL, IEEExplore, Scopus, PubMed, ICML, ICLR), thoroughly examining the multifaceted capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular focus on its healthcare applications, particularly in drug discovery, and Protein engineering research. The survey addresses vital themes, including reasoning, explainability, integration strategies, 41 healthcare-related use cases, benchmarking, datasets, current approach limitations from both healthcare and broader perspectives, and proposed novel approaches for future experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Unlike conventional methods that naively set banned tokens' logits to $-\infty$, which can distort the conversion from raw logits to posterior probabilities and increase output variance, (G)I-DLE re-normalizes the allowed token probabilities to minimize such distortion. We validate our method on the K2-Eval dataset, specifically designed to assess Korean language fluency, logical reasoning, and cultural appropriateness. Experimental results on Qwen2.5 models (ranging from 1.5B to 14B) demonstrate that G-IDLE not only boosts mean evaluation scores but also substantially reduces the variance of output quality.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Enhancing Retrieval Systems with Inference-Time Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17860v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional retrieval methods rely on transforming user queries into vector representations and retrieving documents based on cosine similarity within an embedding space. While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly improving retrieval performance for complex queries.</p></details> |  |

While recent advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in logical reasoning and multi-task generalization, their applications in Re-ID tasks remain limited. They either struggle to perform accurate matching based on identity-relevant features or assist image-dominated branches as auxiliary semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ChatReID, that shifts the focus towards a text-side-dominated retrieval paradigm, enabling flexible and interactive re-identification. To integrate the reasoning abilities of language models into Re-ID pipelines, We first present a large-scale instruction dataset, which contains more than 8 million prompts to promote the model fine-tuning. Next. we introduce a hierarchical progressive tuning strategy, which endows Re-ID ability through three stages of tuning, i.e., from person attribute understanding to fine-grained image retrieval and to multi-modal task reasoning. Extensive experiments across ten popular benchmarks demonstrate that ChatReID outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all Re-ID tasks. More experiments demonstrate that ChatReID not only has the ability to recognize fine-grained details but also to integrate them into a coherent reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences. This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading. Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.</p></details> | 52 pages, 19 figures |
| **[From Chaos to Order: The Atomic Reasoner Framework for Fine-grained Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15944v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, yet their capacity for logical ``slow-thinking'' reasoning persists as a critical research frontier. Current inference scaling paradigms suffer from two fundamental constraints: fragmented thought flows compromising logical coherence, and intensively computational complexity that escalates with search space dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we present \textbf{Atomic Reasoner} (\textbf{AR}), a cognitive inference strategy that enables fine-grained reasoning through systematic atomic-level operations. AR decomposes the reasoning process into atomic cognitive units, employing a cognitive routing mechanism to dynamically construct reasoning representations and orchestrate inference pathways. This systematic methodology implements stepwise, structured cognition, which ensures logical coherence while significantly reducing cognitive load, effectively simulating the cognitive patterns observed in human deep thinking processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AR's superior reasoning capabilities without the computational burden of exhaustive solution searches, particularly excelling in linguistic logic puzzles. These findings substantiate AR's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' capacity for robust, long-sequence logical reasoning and deliberation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration for Reliable LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07627v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.

However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.</p></details> |  |

High-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities, but such datasets remain scarce. Existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive reinforcement learning (RL) or error-prone reasoning chains synthesized by LLMs, posing challenges in scalability and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose SVRC (Structured and Validated Reasoning Chains for Code Generation), a novel framework that mines, restructures, and enriches reasoning chains from community-driven discussions on software engineering platforms. SVRC refines unstructured and incomplete discussions of coding problems by aligning them with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles, ensuring that reasoning chains capture real-world problem-solving strategies and support iterative refinement. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVRC, we introduce CodeThinker, an LLM fine-tuned on 12,444 reasoning-augmented samples generated by SVRC. Experiments on LiveCodeBench show that CodeThinker surpasses its base model by 42.86\% on medium-level code problems in terms of pass@1 and outperforms GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o by 73.14\% and 115.86\%, respectively. Our ablation study further highlights that each component of SVRC contributes to the reasoning capabilities of CodeThinker.</p></details> |  |

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> |  |

AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the 3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically, our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world 3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various 3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt engineering techniques.</p></details> |  |

The ideas that he raised in his study of logical reasoning carried the development of science over the centuries. Today, in the era of AI, this title of the fatherhood of logic has a renewed significance. Behind it lies his original idea that human reasoning could be studied as a process and that perhaps there exist universal systems of reasoning that underly all human reasoning irrespective of the content of what we are reasoning about. In this article, we look into Aristotle's work on human thought, his work on reasoning itself but also on how it relates to science and human endeavor more generally, from a modern perspective of Artificial Intelligence and ask if this can help enlighten our understanding of AI and Science more generally.</p></details> | 40 pages |

We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (excl. appendix)</p></details> |

These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn</p></details> |  |

A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper are available at https://long-cot.github.io/</p></details> |

The quality of the provided demonstrations significantly influences the success of downstream inference tasks. Current unsupervised CoT methods primarily select examples based on the semantics of the questions, which can introduce noise and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose leveraging reasoning patterns to enhance CoT prompting effectiveness. Reasoning patterns represent the process by which language models arrive at their final results. By utilizing prior knowledge and prompt-based methods from large models, we first construct task-specific pattern sets. We then select diverse demonstrations based on different reasoning patterns. This approach not only mitigates the impact of noise but also provides explicit interpretability to help us understand the mechanisms of CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is more robust and consistently leads to improvements across various reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We identify three hierarchical tiers and two corresponding transitions and show their correspondence to specific abilities in transformer-based language models (LMs). These emergent abilities have often been described in terms of scaling; we show that it is the transition between tiers, rather than scaled size itself, that determines a system's capabilities. Specifically, humans effortlessly process language yet require critical training to perform arithmetic or logical reasoning tasks; and LMs possess language abilities absent from predecessor systems, yet still struggle with logical processing. We submit a novel benchmark of computational power, provide empirical evaluations of humans and fifteen LMs, and, most significantly, provide a theoretically grounded framework to promote careful thinking about these crucial topics. The resulting principled analyses provide explanatory accounts of the abilities and shortfalls of LMs, and suggest actionable insights into the expansion of their logic abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Vision Full-view Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16965v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive (AR) image generation, models based on the 'next-token prediction' paradigm of LLMs have shown comparable performance to diffusion models by reducing inductive biases. However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the image's structure and details, impacting the generation's accuracy and stability. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Prompt engineering, as a key technique for guiding LLMs, leverages specifically designed prompts to improve model performance on complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation while maintaining contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by prompt engineering from the field of NLP, we propose Vision Full-view prompt (VF prompt) to enhance autoregressive image generation. Specifically, we design specialized image-related VF prompts for AR image generation to simulate the process of human image creation. This enhances contextual logic ability by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without VF prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p></details> |  |

The reliance on retrieval alone proves insufficient for extracting deep, domain-specific knowledge performing in logical reasoning from specialized corpora. To address this, we introduce sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmentation Generation (PIKE-RAG), focusing on extracting, understanding, and applying specialized knowledge, while constructing coherent rationale to incrementally steer LLMs toward accurate responses. Recognizing the diverse challenges of industrial tasks, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies tasks based on their complexity in knowledge extraction and application, allowing for a systematic evaluation of RAG systems' problem-solving capabilities. This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications. Furthermore, we propose knowledge atomizing and knowledge-aware task decomposition to effectively extract multifaceted knowledge from the data chunks and iteratively construct the rationale based on original query and the accumulated knowledge, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, technique report</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding. COVER establishes a new standard for assessing MLLMs' logical reasoning abilities in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls. Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent. Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p></details> |  |

While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LMM-R1}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that LMM-R1 achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Superior Quantization Accuracy: A Layer-sensitive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06518v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision and Language Models have exhibited remarkable human-like intelligence in tasks such as natural language comprehension, problem-solving, logical reasoning, and knowledge retrieval. However, training and serving these models require substantial computational resources, posing a significant barrier to their widespread application and further research. To mitigate this challenge, various model compression techniques have been developed to reduce computational requirements. Nevertheless, existing methods often employ uniform quantization configurations, failing to account for the varying difficulties across different layers in quantizing large neural network models. This paper tackles this issue by leveraging layer-sensitivity features, such as activation sensitivity and weight distribution Kurtosis, to identify layers that are challenging to quantize accurately and allocate additional memory budget. The proposed methods, named SensiBoost and KurtBoost, respectively, demonstrate notable improvement in quantization accuracy, achieving up to 9% lower perplexity with only a 2% increase in memory budget on LLama models compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction during learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the logic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently proposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming at significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search space. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of both symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively integrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training process is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of raw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional interesting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol grounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the memorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of symbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to effectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction, boosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning.

Evaluating Interventions for Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15584v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust. Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with 400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making wrong reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance interventions in human-LLM collaboration.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce KnowLogic, a benchmark generated through a knowledge-driven synthetic data strategy. KnowLogic integrates diverse commonsense knowledge, plausible scenarios, and various types of logical reasoning. One of the key advantages of KnowLogic is its adjustable difficulty levels, allowing for flexible control over question complexity. It also includes fine-grained labels for in-depth evaluation of LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple dimensions. Our benchmark consists of 3,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) questions across various domains, and presents significant challenges for current LLMs, with the highest-performing model achieving only 69.57\%. Our analysis highlights common errors, such as misunderstandings of low-frequency commonsense, logical inconsistencies, and overthinking. This approach, along with our benchmark, provides a valuable tool for assessing and enhancing LLMs' commonsense reasoning capabilities and can be applied to a wide range of knowledge domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow of Reasoning:Training LLMs for Divergent Problem Solving with Minimal Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05673v5)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, these systems often struggle with complex database structures and domain-specific queries, as they primarily focus on enhancing logical reasoning and SQL syntax while overlooking the critical need for comprehensive database understanding. To address this limitation, we propose DB-Explore, a novel framework that systematically aligns LLMs with database knowledge through automated exploration and instruction synthesis. DB-Explore constructs database graphs to capture complex relational schemas, leverages GPT-4 to systematically mine structural patterns and semantic knowledge, and synthesizes instructions to distill this knowledge for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. Our framework enables comprehensive database understanding through diverse sampling strategies and automated instruction generation, bridging the gap between database structures and language models. Experiments conducted on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks validate the effectiveness of DB-Explore, achieving an execution accuracy of 52.1% on BIRD and 84.0% on SPIDER. Notably, our open-source implementation, based on the Qwen2.5-coder-7B model, outperforms multiple GPT-4-driven text-to-SQL systems in comparative evaluations, and achieves near state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational cost.</p></details> |  |

However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[LGR2: Language Guided Reward Relabeling for Accelerating Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05881v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interactive systems that utilize natural language instructions to solve complex robotic control tasks has long been a goal of the robotics community. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation, translating high-level instructions into low-level robotic actions still remains challenging. Furthermore, solving such tasks often requires acquiring policies to execute diverse subtasks and integrating them to achieve the final objective. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) offers a promising solution for solving such tasks by enabling temporal abstraction and improved exploration. However, HRL suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing lower-level behaviour, which hinders effective policy learning. We propose LGR2, a novel HRL framework that mitigates non-stationarity in HRL by using language-guided higher-level rewards that remain unaffected by the changing lower-level policy behaviour. To analyze the efficacy of our approach, we perform empirical analysis to demonstrate that LGR2 effectively mitigates non-stationarity in HRL and attains success rates exceeding 70% in challenging, sparsely-rewarded robotic navigation and manipulation environments, where other baselines typically fail to show significant progress. Finally, we perform real-world robotic experiments on complex tasks and demonstrate that LGR2 consistently outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of counseling datasets, particularly in Chinese corpora, restricts their application in this field. To address this, we constructed Psy-Insight, the first mental health-oriented explainable multi-task bilingual dataset. We collected face-to-face multi-turn counseling dialogues, which are annotated with multi-task labels and conversation process explanations. Our annotations include psychotherapy, emotion, strategy, and topic labels, as well as turn-level reasoning and session-level guidance. Psy-Insight is not only suitable for tasks such as label recognition but also meets the need for training LLMs to act as empathetic counselors through logical reasoning. Experiments show that training LLMs on Psy-Insight enables the models to not only mimic the conversation style but also understand the underlying strategies and reasoning of counseling.</p></details> |  |

A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |
| **[On Memorization of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles. Our code and data are available at https://memkklogic.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although existing CLQA algorithms achieve high accuracy in answering such queries, their reasoning time and memory usage scale significantly with the number of First-Order Logic (FOL) operators involved, creating serious challenges for practical deployment. In addition, current research primarily focuses on algorithm-level optimizations for CLQA tasks, often overlooking compiler-level optimizations, which can offer greater generality and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a Knowledge Graph Compiler, namely KGCompiler, the first deep learning compiler specifically designed for CLQA tasks. By incorporating KG-specific optimizations proposed in this paper, KGCompiler enhances the reasoning performance of CLQA algorithms without requiring additional manual modifications to their implementations. At the same time, it significantly reduces memory usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KGCompiler accelerates CLQA algorithms by factors ranging from 1.04x to 8.26x, with an average speedup of 3.71x. We also provide an interface to enable hands-on experience with KGCompiler.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have examined the impact of factors such as data volume and model size on English models, the scaling properties of instruction tuning in other languages remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of data quantity, model size, and data construction methods on instruction tuning for Chinese LLMs. We utilize a newly curated dataset, DoIT, which includes over 40,000 high-quality instruction instances covering ten underlying abilities, such as creative writing, code generation, and logical reasoning. Our experiments, conducted on models ranging from 7b to 33b parameters, yield three key findings: (i) While these factors directly affect overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, whereas others demonstrate significant resistance. (ii) The scaling sensitivity of different abilities to these factors can be explained by two features: Complexity and Transference. (iii) By tailoring training strategies to their varying sensitivities, specific abilities can be efficiently learned, enhancing performance on two public benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING 2025</p></details> |

However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Meet Symbolic Provers for Logical Reasoning Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>First-order logic (FOL) reasoning, which involves sequential deduction, is pivotal for intelligent systems and serves as a valuable task for evaluating reasoning capabilities, particularly in chain-of-thought (CoT) contexts. Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

Most previous works have focused on learning entity/relation embeddings and simulating first-order logic operators with various neural networks. However, they are bottlenecked by the inability to share world knowledge to improve logical reasoning, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a complex reasoning schema over KG upon large language models (LLMs), containing a curriculum-based logical-aware instruction tuning framework, named LACT. Specifically, we augment the arbitrary first-order logical queries via binary tree decomposition, to stimulate the reasoning capability of LLMs. To address the difficulty gap among different types of complex queries, we design a simple and flexible logic-aware curriculum learning framework. Experiments across widely used datasets demonstrate that LACT has substantial improvements~(brings an average +5.5% MRR score) over advanced methods, achieving the new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

By first-order, we mean these problems can be instantiated with potentially an infinite number of problem instances of varying sizes. They are also challenging being NP-hard and requiring several reasoning steps to reach a solution. While existing work has focused on coming up with datasets with hard benchmarks, there is limited work which exploits the first-order nature of the problem structure. To address this challenge, we present FCoReBench, a dataset of 40 such challenging problems, along with scripts to generate problem instances of varying sizes and automatically verify and generate their solutions. We first observe that LLMs, even when aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset, being unable to leverage the underlying structure of these problems. We specifically observe a drop in performance with increasing problem size. In response, we propose a new approach, SymPro-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers and program interpreters, along with feedback from a few solved examples, to achieve huge performance gains. Our proposed approach is robust to changes in the problem size, and has the unique characteristic of not requiring any LLM call during inference time, unlike earlier approaches. As an additional experiment, we also demonstrate SymPro-LM's effectiveness on other logical reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses - a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitate an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are threefold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, especially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts. We have made our source code and benchmarks available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Order Doesn't Matter, But Reasoning Does: Training LLMs with Order-Centric Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19907v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and coherent inference. However, LLMs struggle with reasoning order variations and fail to generalize across logically equivalent transformations. LLMs often rely on fixed sequential patterns rather than true logical understanding. To address this issue, we introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on commutativity in logical reasoning. We first randomly shuffle independent premises to introduce condition order augmentation. For reasoning steps, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between steps, which allows us to identify valid reorderings of steps while preserving logical correctness. By leveraging order-centric augmentations, models can develop a more flexible and generalized reasoning process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning performance and adaptability to diverse logical structures. We release our codes and augmented data in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Order-Centric-Data-Augmentation-822C/.</p></details> |  |

Numerous studies are dedicated to exploring and expanding the boundaries of this reasoning capability. However, tasks that embody both reasoning and recall characteristics are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce such a novel task, code reasoning, to provide a new perspective for the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We summarize three meta-benchmarks based on established forms of logical reasoning, and instantiate these into eight specific benchmark tasks. Our testing on these benchmarks reveals that LLMs continue to struggle with identifying satisfactory reasoning pathways. Additionally, we present a new pathway exploration pipeline inspired by human intricate problem-solving methods. This Reflective Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment (RHDA) pipeline consists of the following iterative steps: (1) Proposing potential hypotheses based on observations and decomposing them; (2) Utilizing tools to validate hypotheses and reflection outcomes; (3) Revising hypothesis in light of observations. Our approach effectively mitigates logical chain collapses arising from forgetting or hallucination issues in multi-step reasoning, resulting in performance gains of up to $3\times$. Finally, we expanded this pipeline by applying it to simulate complex household tasks in real-world scenarios, specifically in VirtualHome, enhancing the handling of failure cases. We release our code and all of results at https://github.com/TnTWoW/code_reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Poster;23 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce TextGames, an innovative benchmark specifically crafted to assess LLMs through demanding text-based games that require advanced skills in pattern recognition, spatial awareness, arithmetic, and logical reasoning. Our analysis probes LLMs' performance in both single-turn and multi-turn reasoning, and their abilities in leveraging feedback to correct subsequent answers through self-reflection. Our findings reveal that, although LLMs exhibit proficiency in addressing most easy and medium-level problems, they face significant challenges with more difficult tasks. In contrast, humans are capable of solving all tasks when given sufficient time. Moreover, we observe that LLMs show improved performance in multi-turn predictions through self-reflection, yet they still struggle with sequencing, counting, and following complex rules consistently. Additionally, models optimized for reasoning outperform pre-trained LLMs that prioritize instruction following, highlighting the crucial role of reasoning skills in addressing highly complex problems.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments.

| **[Sphere Neural-Networks for Rational Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like communication, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training data, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic unification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this issue, neurosymbolic approaches incorporate a symbolic solver. Specifically, an LLM only translates a natural language problem into a satisfiability (SAT) problem that consists of first-order logic formulas, and a sound symbolic solver returns a mathematically correct solution. However, we discover that LLMs have difficulties to capture complex logical semantics hidden in the natural language during translation. To resolve this limitation, we propose a Compositional First-Order Logic Translation. An LLM first parses a natural language sentence into newly defined logical dependency structures that consist of an atomic subsentence and its dependents, then sequentially translate the parsed subsentences. Since multiple logical dependency structures and sequential translations are possible for a single sentence, we also introduce two Verification algorithms to ensure more reliable results. We utilize an SAT solver to rigorously compare semantics of generated first-order logic formulas and select the most probable one. We evaluate the proposed method, dubbed CLOVER, on seven logical reasoning benchmarks and show that it outperforms the previous neurosymbolic approaches and achieves new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

Current methods typically use text embeddings to measure semantic similarity, which often introduces bias in multi-step reasoning tasks. This occurs because text embeddings contain irrelevant semantic information and lack deeper reasoning structures. To address this, we propose GraphIC, a graph-based retrieval model that leverages reasoning-aware representation and specialized similarity metric for in-context example retrieval. GraphIC first constructs thought graphs-directed, node-attributed graphs that explicitly model reasoning steps and their dependencies-for candidate examples and queries. This approach filters out superficial semantics while preserving essential reasoning processes. Next, GraphIC retrieves examples using a novel similarity metric tailored for these graphs, capturing sequential reasoning patterns and asymmetry between examples. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms 10 baseline methods. Our results highlight the importance of reasoning-aware retrieval in ICL, offering a robust solution for enhancing LLM performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning, empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the multidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and provides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making LLMs Reason? The Intermediate Language Problem in Neurosymbolic Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17216v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning tasks manifest themselves as a challenge to Large Language Models (LLMs). Neurosymbolic approaches use LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems formulated in natural language into a formal intermediate language. Subsequently, the usage of symbolic reasoners yields reliable solving thereof. However, LLMs often fail in translation due to poorly chosen intermediate languages. We introduce the intermediate language problem, which is the problem of choosing a suitable formal language representation for neurosymbolic approaches. Theoretically, we argue that its origins lie in the inability of LLMs to distinguish syntax from semantics and the relative independence of the problem from its representation. We showcase its existence experimentally by contrasting two intermediate languages, Answer Set Programming and the Python Knowledge Engine. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of varying degrees of supplementary context information. Our results show a maximum difference in overall-accuracy of 53.20% and 49.26% in execution-accuracy. When using the GPT4o-mini LLM we beat the state-of-the-art in overall-accuracy on the ProntoQA dataset by 21.20% and by 50.50% on the ProofWriter dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Haystacks: Probing LLMs Long-Context Logical Reasoning (Without Easily Identifiable Unrelated Padding)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17169v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate promising long context processing capabilities, with recent models touting context windows close to one million tokens. However, the evaluations supporting these claims often involve simple retrieval tasks or synthetic tasks padded with irrelevant text, which the models may easily detect and discard. In this work, we generate lengthy simplified English text with first-order logic representations spanning up to 2048 clauses (around 25k GPT-4 tokens). We formulate an evaluation task with evidence retrieval for contradiction detection. The long, homogeneous text is filled with distractors that are both hard to distinguish from relevant evidences and provably not interfering with them. Our evaluation of evidence retrieval shows that the effective context window is much smaller with realistic distractors, already crumbling at 128 clauses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Logical Consistency in Transformers via Query-Key Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17017v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to perform multi-step logical reasoning remains an open challenge. Although Chain-of-Thought prompting has improved logical reasoning by enabling models to generate intermediate steps, it lacks mechanisms to assess the coherence of these logical transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight evaluation strategy for logical reasoning that uses query-key alignments inside transformer attention heads. By computing a single forward pass and extracting a "QK-score" from carefully chosen heads, our method reveals latent representations that reliably separate valid from invalid inferences, offering a scalable alternative to traditional ablation-based techniques. We also provide an empirical validation on multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness of our evaluation method against distractors and increased reasoning depth. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of models, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Integration Brings Causal and Reliable Reasoning Proofs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09802v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two lines of approaches are adopted for complex reasoning with LLMs. One line of work prompts LLMs with various reasoning structures, while the structural outputs can be naturally regarded as intermediate reasoning steps. Another line of work adopt LLM-free declarative solvers to do the reasoning task, rendering higher reasoning accuracy but lacking interpretability due to the black-box nature of the solvers. Aiming to resolve the trade-off between answer accuracy and interpretability, we present a simple extension to the latter line of work. Specifically, we showcase that the intermediate search logs generated by Prolog interpreters can be accessed and interpreted into human-readable reasoning proofs. As long as LLMs correctly translate problem descriptions into Prolog representations, the corresponding reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable. On two logical reasoning and one arithmetic reasoning datasets, our framework obtains significant improvements in terms of both answer accuracy and reasoning proof accuracy.

To obtain more accurate assessments of models' reasoning capabilities, we propose an automated method for synthesizing open-ended logic puzzles, and use it to develop a bilingual benchmark, AutoLogi. Our approach features program-based verification and controllable difficulty levels, enabling more reliable evaluation that better distinguishes models' reasoning abilities. Extensive evaluation of eight modern LLMs shows that AutoLogi can better reflect true model capabilities, with performance scores spanning from 35% to 73% compared to the narrower range of 21% to 37% on the source multiple-choice dataset. Beyond benchmark creation, this synthesis method can generate high-quality training data by incorporating program verifiers into the rejection sampling process, enabling systematic enhancement of LLMs' reasoning capabilities across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.02439</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Scoring Processes: Dissecting the Differences between LLMs and Human Graders in Automatic Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18328v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results underscore the need for a nuanced approach when applying LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Technology, Knowledge, and Learning (TKNL)</p></details> |

Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04937v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossVTON: Mimicking the Logic Reasoning on Cross-category Virtual Try-on guided by Tri-zone Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14373v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in image-based virtual try-on systems, generating realistic and robust fitting images for cross-category virtual try-on remains a challenging task. The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triangulating LLM Progress through Benchmarks, Games, and Cognitive Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14359v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine three evaluation paradigms: large question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We use this method to automatically create several datasets consisting of questions asking for the truth or falsity of first-order logic statements in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. While the resolution of these questions does not require any knowledge beyond basic notation of first-order logic and set theory, it does require a degree of planning and logical reasoning, which can be controlled up to arbitrarily high difficulty by the complexity of the generated statements. Furthermore, we do extensive evaluations of the performance of various large language models, including recent models such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini, on these datasets. All of the datasets along with the code used for generating them, as well as all data from the evaluations is publicly available at https://github.com/bkuckuck/logical-skills-of-llms.</p></details> | 67 pages, 24 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware DistIllation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods face several limitations: inference-phase techniques (e.g., Chain of Thoughts) rely on prompt selection and the pretrained knowledge; sentence-level Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with step-wise mathematical correctness and depend on stronger models distillation or human annotations; while Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches incur high GPU memory costs and unstable training. To address these, we propose \textbf{S}elf-training framework integrating \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{P}reference learning using \textbf{D}ynamic value margin (SPPD). SPPD leverages a process-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman optimality equation to derive \textbf{dynamic value margin} on step-level preference optimization, which employs tree-based self-sampling on model responses \textbf{without any distillation} from other models. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that SPPD is \textbf{equivalent to on-policy policy gradient methods} under reward constraints. Experiments on 7B-scale models demonstrate superior performance across in-domain and out-domain mathematical benchmarks. We open-source our code at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SSDPO-D-DCDD}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SPPD-DCDD}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15806v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

| **[Detecting LLM Fact-conflicting Hallucinations Enhanced by Temporal-logic-based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13416v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) face the challenge of hallucinations -- outputs that seem coherent but are actually incorrect. A particularly damaging type is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where generated content contradicts established facts. Addressing FCH presents three main challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and maintaining large-scale benchmark datasets is difficult and resource-intensive; 2) Generating complex and efficient test cases that the LLM has not been trained on -- especially those involving intricate temporal features -- is challenging, yet crucial for eliciting hallucinations; and 3) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, particularly with complex logical relationships, as it requires transparency in the model's decision-making process. This paper presents Drowzee, an innovative end-to-end metamorphic testing framework that utilizes temporal logic to identify fact-conflicting hallucinations (FCH) in large language models (LLMs). Drowzee builds a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia and uses automated temporal-logic reasoning to convert this knowledge into a large, extensible set of test cases with ground truth answers. LLMs are tested using these cases through template-based prompts, which require them to generate both answers and reasoning steps. To validate the reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that compare the semantic structure of LLM outputs to the ground truths. Across nine LLMs in nine different knowledge domains, experimental results show that Drowzee effectively identifies rates of non-temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%, and rates of temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 16.7% to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, under review. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.00648</p></details> |
| **[Deliberate Reasoning in Language Models as Structure-Aware Planning with an Accurate World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03136v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Smooth Transition Between Induction and Deduction: Fast Abductive Learning Based on Probabilistic Symbol Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12919v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abductive learning (ABL) that integrates strengths of machine learning and logical reasoning to improve the learning generalization, has been recently shown effective. However, its efficiency is affected by the transition between numerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computational costs in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited. In this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithms for ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbol relationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes, resulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address these challenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as Probabilistic Symbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction and deduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged. We leverage probability as a bridge and present an efficient data structure, achieving the transfer from a continuous probability sequence to discrete Boolean sequences with low computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate the promising results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
| **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in inference-time techniques demonstrate the potential to enhance LLM reasoning without additional training by exploring intermediate steps during inference. Notably, OpenAI's o1 model shows promising performance through its novel use of multi-step reasoning and verification. Here, we explore how scaling inference-time techniques can improve reasoning and planning, focusing on understanding the tradeoff between computational cost and performance. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, known as Sys2Bench, and perform extensive experiments evaluating existing inference-time techniques on eleven diverse tasks across five categories, including arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, common sense reasoning, algorithmic reasoning, and planning. Our findings indicate that simply scaling inference-time computation has limitations, as no single inference-time technique consistently performs well across all reasoning and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose HopRAG, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, HopRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections established via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a retrieve-reason-prune mechanism: starting with lexically or semantically similar passages, the system explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to identify truly relevant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate HopRAG's superiority, achieving 76.78\% higher answer accuracy and 65.07\% improved retrieval F1 score compared to conventional methods.

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code will be publicly available once this paper is published.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown that guiding models with intermediate steps, such as keywords, outlines, or reasoning chains, can significantly improve performance, coherence, and interpretability. However, these methods often depend on predefined intermediate formats and annotated data, limiting their scalability and generalizability. In this work, we introduce a task-agnostic framework that enables models to generate intermediate "warmup" sequences. These warmup sequences, serving as an initial state for subsequent generation, are optimized to enhance the probability of generating the target sequence without relying on external supervision or human-designed structures. Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles, our method iteratively refines these intermediate steps to maximize their contribution to the final output, similar to reward-driven optimization in reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experimental results across tasks such as translation, summarization, and multi-choice question answering for logical reasoning show that our approach outperforms traditional SFT methods, and offers a scalable and flexible solution for sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p></details> |  |

This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical forms should be considered as important factors. In addition, we show similarities and discrepancies between the logical reasoning performances of humans and LLMs by collecting and comparing behavioral data from both.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[PhysReason: A Comprehensive Benchmark towards Physics-Based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12054v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various domains, especially mathematics and logic reasoning. However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models. Our code and data will be published at https:/dxzxy12138.github.io/PhysReason.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mechanistic Interpretation of Syllogistic Reasoning in Auto-Regressive Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08590v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on logical reasoning in Language Models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether they can learn systematic reasoning principles during pre-training or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. This paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic reasoning in LMs to advance the understanding of internal dynamics. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at interpreting content-independent reasoning mechanisms. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic reasoning, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes, model sizes and architectures, finding that the identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for the schemes on which the models achieve high downstream accuracy (> 60%), and that the activation patterns apply to models of different families. Overall, our findings suggest that LMs indeed learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalizable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.</p></details> |  |

First, we synthesize complex reasoning problems through source algorithm problems and test cases. Then, standard answers and intermediate variable outputs are obtained for each problem based on standard python solutions and test cases. Finally, with the guidance of code intermediate variables, we synthesize the text reasoning process for each reasoning problems. Through this method, we can synthesize data that is difficult, scalable, effective, and comes with golden standard answers and high-quality reasoning processes. As a result, with our 540K synthesized dataset constructed solely from 2,360 algorithm problems, our approach Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/jiangjin1999/LogicPro achieves significant improvements in multiple models for the datasets \textit{BBH$^{27}$}, \textit{LogicBench}, \textit{DROP}, \textit{AR-LSAT}, and \textit{GSM8K}, etc. outperforming a wide range of existing reasoning datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dialogue-based Explanations for Logical Reasoning using Structured Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11291v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in knowledge bases (KBs) is a prominent topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI). While there is some work on this problem, the explanations provided by existing approaches often lack critical information or fail to be expressive enough for non-binary conflicts. In this paper, we identify structural weaknesses of the state-of-the-art and propose a generic argumentation-based approach to address these problems. This approach is defined for logics involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets and shows how any such logic can be translated to argumentation. Our work provides dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures to compute and explain a query answer wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics. This allows us to construct dialectical proof trees as explanations, which are more expressive and arguably more intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 gigures, journal</p></details> |
| **[Reversal of Thought: Enhancing Large Language Models with Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning Warm-up](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12323v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in reasoning tasks but face limitations in mathematical and complex logical reasoning. Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exposing Numeracy Gaps: A Benchmark to Evaluate Fundamental Numerical Abilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11075v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and semantic understanding. However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/NumericBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVA-CoT: Let Vision Language Models Reason Step-by-Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10440v4)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 7.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanistic Unveiling of Transformer Circuits: Self-Influence as a Key to Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09022v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models have achieved significant success; however, their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque due to the complexity of non-linear interactions and high-dimensional operations. While previous studies have demonstrated that these models implicitly embed reasoning trees, humans typically employ various distinct logical reasoning mechanisms to complete the same task. It is still unclear which multi-step reasoning mechanisms are used by language models to solve such tasks. In this paper, we aim to address this question by investigating the mechanistic interpretability of language models, particularly in the context of multi-step reasoning tasks. Specifically, we employ circuit analysis and self-influence functions to evaluate the changing importance of each token throughout the reasoning process, allowing us to map the reasoning paths adopted by the model. We apply this methodology to the GPT-2 model on a prediction task (IOI) and demonstrate that the underlying circuits reveal a human-interpretable reasoning process used by the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL2025</p></details> |
| **[The Multilingual Mind : A Survey of Multilingual Reasoning in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09457v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning and multilingual capabilities in Language Models (LMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, their integration into a unified paradigm, multilingual reasoning, is at a nascent stage. Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The LLM Language Network: A Neuroscientific Approach for Identifying Causally Task-Relevant Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02280v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities on not just language tasks, but also various tasks that are not linguistic in nature, such as logical reasoning and social inference. In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
