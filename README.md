| **[A Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Longest Run Subsequence Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14020v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly. In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem. Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement, especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[e-boost: Boosted E-Graph Extraction with Adaptive Heuristics and Exact Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13020v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However, traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities, guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster. Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at https://github.com/Yu-Maryland/e-boost.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoCut: Strengthening Integer Programs via Evolution-Guided Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11850v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i) initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57% within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at https://github.com/milad1378yz/EvoCut.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Random-Key Optimizer for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04293v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored for combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available (Github public repository: github.com/RKO-solver), is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[MDNS: Masked Diffusion Neural Sampler via Stochastic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10684v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural $\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Parallel Relaxation for Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02190v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding the optimal solution is often the primary goal in combinatorial optimization (CO). However, real-world applications frequently require diverse solutions rather than a single optimum, particularly in two key scenarios. The first scenario occurs in real-world applications where strictly enforcing every constraint is neither necessary nor desirable. Allowing minor constraint violations can often lead to more cost-effective solutions. This is typically achieved by incorporating the constraints as penalty terms in the objective function, which requires careful tuning of penalty parameters. The second scenario involves cases where CO formulations tend to oversimplify complex real-world factors, such as domain knowledge, implicit trade-offs, or ethical considerations. To address these challenges, generating (i) penalty-diversified solutions by varying penalty intensities and (ii) variation-diversified solutions with distinct structural characteristics provides valuable insights, enabling practitioners to post-select the most suitable solution for their specific needs. However, efficiently discovering these diverse solutions is more challenging than finding a single optimal one. This study introduces Continual Parallel Relaxation Annealing (CPRA), a computationally efficient framework for unsupervised-learning (UL)-based CO solvers that generates diverse solutions within a single training run. CPRA leverages representation learning and parallelization to automatically discover shared representations, substantially accelerating the search for these diverse solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CPRA outperforms existing UL-based solvers in generating these diverse solutions while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10520v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Cross-problem Generalization in Diffusion-Based Neural Combinatorial Solver via Inference Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12188v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CO-Bench: Benchmarking Language Model Agents in Algorithm Search for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04310v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems -- a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agentic frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing the strengths and limitations of existing LLM agents and identifying promising directions for future research. CO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08778v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing (FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA). According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced performance of exploration and exploitation which we call exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale problems with correspondingly low computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages and 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning on the Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08718v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50, and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from worst-case scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Out of the Past: An AI-Enabled Pipeline for Traffic Simulation from Noisy, Multimodal Detector Data and Stakeholder Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21349v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can a traffic simulation be designed to faithfully reflect real-world traffic conditions? One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[RIDGECUT: Learning Graph Partitioning with Rings and Wedges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13986v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful tool for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems due to its ability to learn heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating knowledge that will steer the RL framework for CO solutions towards domain appropriate outcomes remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose RIDGECUT, the first RL framework that constrains the action space to enforce structure-aware partitioning in the Normalized Cut problem. Using transportation networks as a motivating example, we introduce a novel concept that leverages domain knowledge about urban road topology -- where natural partitions often take the form of concentric rings and radial wedges. Our method reshapes the graph into a linear or circular structure to simplify the partitioning task so that we can apply sequential transformers and enables efficient learning via Proximal Policy Optimization. The resulting partitions are not only aligned with expected spatial layouts but also achieve lower normalized cuts compared to existing methods. While we focus on traffic data, our approach is broadly applicable and offers a mechanism for embedding structural priors into RL for graph partitioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[IP Models for Minimum Zero Forcing Sets, Forts, and Related Graph Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07293v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero forcing is a binary coloring game on a graph where a set of filled vertices can force non-filled vertices to become filled following a color change rule. In 2008, the zero forcing number of a graph was shown to be an upper bound on its maximum nullity. In addition, the combinatorial optimization problem for the zero forcing number was shown to be NP-hard. Since then, the study of zero forcing and its related parameters has received considerable attention. In 2018, the forts of a graph were defined as non-empty subsets of vertices where no vertex outside the set has exactly one neighbor in the set. Forts have been used to model zero forcing as an integer program and provide lower bounds on the zero forcing number. To date, three integer programming models have been developed for the zero forcing number of a graph: the Infection Model, Time Step Model, and Fort Cover Model. In this article, we present variations of these models for computing the zero forcing number and related graph parameters, such as the minimum and maximum propagation times, throttling number, and fractional zero forcing number. In addition, we present several new models for computing the realized propagation time interval, all minimal forts of a graph, and the fort number of a graph. We conclude with several numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our models when applied to small and medium order graphs. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence for several open conjectures regarding the propagation time interval, the number of minimal forts, the fort number, and the fractional zero forcing number of a graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Efficient and Reliable Hitting-Set Computations for the Implicit Hitting Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07015v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively. IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer programming. We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP) optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.</p></details> |  |
| **[Study of Robust Features in Formulating Guidance for Heuristic Algorithms for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06129v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI, this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies, certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.</p></details> |  |

These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), its hybrid quantum-classical solver (HA), as well as the third-generation Digital Annealer (DAv3) and Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO) developed by Fujitsu. The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 pseudo code, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off (using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Decomposition Strategies and Multi-shot ASP Solving for Job-shop Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07537v6)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Previous works have designed a plethora of hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.</p></details> |  |

For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+2 ...</summary><p>13+2 pages, 11+3 figures, accepted by Physical Review Research</p></details> |

While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and, more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed base node distribution.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.</p></details> | 34 pages |

The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |

We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph is similarly limited in performance as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by the QAOA for even $q\ge 4$, Max-$q$-XORSAT is bounded away from optimality when optimised using asymptotic analysis due to the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Furthermore, the extension to logarithmic depth leads to a tightening of the upper bound that the QAOA outputs at logarithmic depth for MaxCUT and Max-$q$-XORSAT problems. We also provide some numerical evidence the limitation should be extended to odd $q$ by showing that the OGP exists for the Max-$3$-XORSAT on random regular graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, to be published in the journal of quantum information and computation</p></details> |

Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the network prebunking problem, to identify optimal prebunking targets for minimizing the spread of misinformation in a social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose an approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</p></details> |  |

While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

It has been shown that local search versions of various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20632v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[An integer programming-based approach to construct exact two-sample binomial tests with maximum power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13689v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional hypothesis tests for differences between binomial proportions are at risk of being too liberal (Wald test) or overly conservative (Fisher's exact test). This problem is exacerbated in small samples. Regulators favour exact tests, which provide robust type I error control, even though they may have lower power than non-exact tests. To target an exact test with high power, we extend and evaluate an overlooked approach, proposed in 1969, which determines the rejection region through a binary decision for each outcome vector and uses integer programming to, in line with the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, find an optimal decision boundary that maximizes a power objective subject to type I error constraints. Despite only evaluating the type I error rate for a finite parameter set, our approach guarantees type I error control over the full parameter space. Our results show that the test maximizing average power exhibits remarkable robustness, often showing highest power among comparators while maintaining exact type I error control. The method can be further tailored to prior beliefs by using a weighted average. The findings highlight both the method's practical utility and how techniques from combinatorial optimization can improve statistical methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to algorithm's stagnation.</p></details> |  |

While large-scale quantum computations are currently still out of reach, we can already numerically test such QUBO formulations on a perhaps surprisingly large scale. In this work, we benchmark Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, which captures the main complexity of the QUBO problem. We make a comprehensive benchmark against leading other heuristic algorithms on graphs with up to 53,000 variables by focusing on the wall-clock time. Moreover, we compare the DA performance against published performance results of the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical annealer and the recently proposed QIS3 heuristic. Based on performance statistics for over 2,000 graphs from the MQLib, we find that the DA yields competitive results. We hope that this benchmark demonstrates the extent to which large QUBO instances can be heuristically solved today, yielding consistent results across different solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 + ...</summary><p>24 + 14 pages, 12 figures.

SLA violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms. As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters, learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and SHAP-based interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, we present the Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Chromatic Number and Treewidth problems on, so-called, continuous or metric graphs where every edge is represented by a unit-length continuous interval rather than by a pair of vertices. If any point of any unit-interval edge is considered as a possible member of a hitting set or a cover, the classical combinatorial problems become trickier and many open questions arise. Notably, in many real-life applications, such a continuous view of a graph is more natural than the classic combinatorial definition of a graph. The contribution of this paper is twofold: i) we survey the known results for optimization problems on continuous graphs, and ii) we create a list of open problems related to the continuous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Memetic Algorithm for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21740v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs (CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process, significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these solvers focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers), when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a compelling and scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms applied to 3D spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT). We benchmark these methods against the performance of a leading quantum annealer on the same problem instances. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, in line with expectations from extreme value theory. We then show that APT, when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, exhibits a more favorable scaling and ultimately outperforms DT-SQA. We demonstrate these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware, projecting that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a new, rigorous classical baseline, clarifying the landscape for assessing a practical quantum advantage and presenting p-computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are openly available at https://github.com/OPUSLab/3DSpinGlassWithPbits.git</p></details> |

In particular, the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials, while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing the tuning process for CIMs.</p></details> |  |

In practical deployments, the control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks, with configuration indices transmitted over low latency, yet imperfect, wireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to significant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading system performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook index assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem, equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are "cities" and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion. A novel three-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this, consisting of a provision phase, a shotgun phase, and a fuzzy concatenation phase. Simulation results show that the method outperforms conventional indexing strategies and achieves near-optimal robustness to index errors, while also being scalable and hardwareagnostic for real time deployment. Future work includes multiple bits error correction and online adaptive mapping for time varying channels.</p></details> | RIS codebook |

Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Collaborative Framework Integrating Large Language Model and Chemical Fragment Space: Mutual Inspiration for Lead Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13580v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Combinatorial Optimization with Graphical Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16031v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing work in online stochastic combinatorial optimization assumes that inputs are drawn from independent distributions -- a strong assumption that often fails in practice. At the other extreme, arbitrary correlations are equivalent to worst-case inputs via Yao's minimax principle, making good algorithms often impossible. This motivates the study of intermediate models that capture mild correlations while still permitting non-trivial algorithms. In this paper, we study online combinatorial optimization under Markov Random Fields (MRFs), a well-established graphical model for structured dependencies. MRFs parameterize correlation strength via the maximum weighted degree $\Delta$, smoothly interpolating between independence ($\Delta = 0$) and full correlation ($\Delta \to \infty$). While na\"ively this yields $e^{O(\Delta)}$-competitive algorithms and $\Omega(\Delta)$ hardness, we ask: when can we design tight $\Theta(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms? We present general techniques achieving $O(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms for both minimization and maximization problems under MRF-distributed inputs. For minimization problems with coverage constraints (e.g., Facility Location and Steiner Tree), we reduce to the well-studied $p$-sample model. For maximization problems (e.g., matchings and combinatorial auctions with XOS buyers), we extend the "balanced prices" framework for online allocation problems to MRFs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16004v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Design of Structured Variational Quantum Circuits with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16001v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v5)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown significant benefits in solving CO problems, reducing reliance on domain expertise and improving computational efficiency. However, the absence of a unified benchmarking framework leads to inconsistent evaluations, limits reproducibility, and increases engineering overhead, raising barriers to adoption for new researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce RL4CO, a unified and extensive benchmark with in-depth library coverage of 27 CO problem environments and 23 state-of-the-art baselines. Built on efficient software libraries and best practices in implementation, RL4CO features modularized implementation and flexible configurations of diverse environments, policy architectures, RL algorithms, and utilities with extensive documentation. RL4CO helps researchers build on existing successes while exploring and developing their own designs, facilitating the entire research process by decoupling science from heavy engineering. We finally provide extensive benchmark studies to inspire new insights and future work. RL4CO has already attracted numerous researchers in the community and is open-sourced at https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Oral |
| **[A Large Language Model-Enhanced Q-learning for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06178v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.</p></details> |  |

We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |

The process that takes a real-world problem and extracts a clean mathematical abstraction of it often throws out a lot of "side information" which is deemed irrelevant. However, the discarded information could be of real significance to the end-user of the algorithm's output. All solutions of the same cost are not necessarily of equal impact in the real-world; some solutions may be much more desirable than others, even at the expense of additional increase in cost. If the impact, positive or negative, is mostly felt by some specific (minority) subgroups of the population, the population at large will be largely unaware of it. In this work we ask the question of finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems that are "unbiased" with respect to a collection of specified subgroups of the total population.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposed Quadratization: Efficient QUBO Formulation for Learning Bayesian Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06926v7)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms and hardware for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems have made significant recent progress. This advancement has focused attention on formulating combinatorial optimization problems as quadratic polynomials. To improve the performance of solving large QUBO problems, it is essential to minimize the number of binary variables used in the objective function. In this paper, we propose a QUBO formulation that offers a bit capacity advantage over conventional quadratization techniques. As a key application, this formulation significantly reduces the number of binary variables required for score-based Bayesian network structure learning. Experimental results on $16$ instances, ranging from $37$ to $223$ variables, demonstrate that our approach requires notably fewer binary variables than quadratization. Moreover, an annealing machine that implement our formulation have outperformed existing algorithms in score maximization.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures, AAAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Hardware-Compatible Single-Shot Feasible-Space Heuristics for Solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09676v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research into the development of special-purpose computing architectures designed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems has flourished in recent years. It has been demonstrated in the literature that such special-purpose solvers can outperform traditional CMOS architectures by orders of magnitude with respect to timing metrics on synthetic problems. However, they face challenges with constrained problems such as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), where mapping to binary formulations such as QUBO introduces overhead and limits parallelism. In-memory computing (IMC) devices, such as memristor-based analog Ising machines, offer significant speedups and efficiency gains over traditional CPU-based solvers, particularly for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we present a novel local search heuristic designed for IMC hardware to tackle the QAP. Our approach enables massive parallelism that allows for computing of full neighbourhoods simultaneously to make update decisions. We ensure binary solutions remain feasible by selecting local moves that lead to neighbouring feasible solutions, leveraging feasible-space search heuristics and the underlying structure of a given problem. Our approach is compatible with both digital computers and analog hardware. We demonstrate its effectiveness in CPU implementations by comparing it with state-of-the-art heuristics for solving the QAP.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p></details> |  |

The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums. We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes. To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds. Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, includes full algorithmic framework and empirical validation.

This study benchmarks five software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to 45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time. Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption. PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU. SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality, scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources permit.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, their training, architectural design, and hyperparameter tuning remain challenging as these involve multiple computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems. Here we introduce quantum hypernetworks as a mechanism to train binary neural networks on quantum computers, which unify the search over parameters, hyperparameters, and architectures in a single optimization loop. Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits. We represent our quantum hypernetworks as variational quantum circuits, and find that an optimal circuit depth maximizes the probability of finding performant binary neural networks.

The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</p></details> |  |

The target is, for a given natural number $k < n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$.

We study LP-type problems in several streaming and distributed big data models, giving $\varepsilon$-approximation linear sketching algorithms with a focus on the high accuracy regime with low dimensionality $d$, that is, when ${d < (1/\varepsilon)^{0.999}}$. Our main result is an $O(ds)$ pass algorithm with $O(s( \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)^{3d/s}) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d, \log (1/\varepsilon))$ space complexity in words, for any parameter $s \in [1, d \log (1/\varepsilon)]$, to solve $\varepsilon$-approximate LP-type problems of $O(d)$ combinatorial and VC dimension. Notably, by taking $s = d \log (1/\varepsilon)$, we achieve space complexity polynomial in $d$ and polylogarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$, presenting exponential improvements in $1/\varepsilon$ over current algorithms. We complement our results by showing lower bounds of $(1/\varepsilon)^{\Omega(d)}$ for any $1$-pass algorithm solving the $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation MEB and linear SVM problems, further motivating our multi-pass approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in APPROX 2025, 45 pages; Updated author information in v2</p></details> |

We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</p></details> |  |

Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, ICCV 2025 Findings Oral, Project pages: https://jzr99.github.io/DNF-Avatar/</p></details> |

OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Traceplot Thickens: Developing All-Purpose Convergence Diagnostics for any Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15392v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are frequently used to perform inference under a Bayesian modeling framework. Convergence diagnostics, such as traceplots, the Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor, and effective sample size, are used to visualize and monitor how well the sampler has explored the parameter space and the mixing of multiple chains. However, these classic diagnostics can be undefined or ineffective when the sample space of the algorithm varies in dimension or has a large number of discrete parameters. In this article, we develop a novel approach to produce convergence diagnostics in these difficult scenarios by mapping the original sample space to the real-line and then evaluating the convergence diagnostics on the mapped values. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a MCMC algorithm sampling from a Dirichlet process mixture model. The proposed diagnostics are also used to evaluate the performance of a Bayesian kernel machine regression model for estimating the health effect of multi-pollutant mixtures in the Study of Environment, Lifestyle, and Fibroids. Based on diagnostics for the latter dataset, we then explain how we modify the MCMC sampler to improve convergence.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Toward Better EHR Reasoning in LLMs: Reinforcement Learning with Expert Attention Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR) reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks.

While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Stochastic Packing with General Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13458v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in studying online stochastic packing under more general correlation structures, motivated by the complex data sets and models driving modern applications. Several past works either assume correlations are weak or have a particular structure, have a complexity scaling with the number of Markovian "states of the world" (which may be exponentially large e.g. in the case of full history dependence), scale poorly with the horizon $T$, or make additional continuity assumptions. Surprisingly, we show that for all $\epsilon$, the online stochastic packing linear programming problem with general correlations (suitably normalized and with sparse columns) has an approximately optimal policy (with optimality gap $\epsilon T$) whose per-decision runtime scales as the time to simulate a single sample path of the underlying stochastic process (assuming access to a Monte Carlo simulator), multiplied by a constant independent of the horizon or number of Markovian states. We derive analogous results for network revenue management, and online bipartite matching and independent set in bounded-degree graphs, by rounding. Our algorithms implement stochastic gradient methods in a novel on-the-fly/recursive manner for the associated massive deterministic-equivalent linear program on the corresponding probability space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Bayesian Computation sequential Monte Carlo via random forests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15865v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a popular inference method when likelihoods are hard to come by. Practical bottlenecks of ABC applications include selecting statistics that summarize the data without losing too much information or introducing uncertainty, and choosing distance functions and tolerance thresholds that balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Recent studies have shown that ABC methods using random forest (RF) methodology perform well while circumventing many of ABC's drawbacks. However, RF construction is computationally expensive for large numbers of trees and model simulations, and there can be high uncertainty in the posterior if the prior distribution is uninformative. Here we further adapt random forests to the ABC setting in two ways. The first exploits distributional random forests to provide a direct method for inferring the joint posterior distribution of parameters of interest, while the second describes a sequential Monte Carlo approach which updates the prior distribution iteratively to focus on the most likely regions in the parameter space. We show that the new methods can accurately infer posterior distributions for a wide range of deterministic and stochastic models in different scientific areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[Monte Carlo Functional Regularisation for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13006v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods. Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Contact Sequence and Patch Planning for Dynamic Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12928v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots have the potential to traverse highly constrained environments with agile maneuvers. However, planning such motions requires solving a highly challenging optimization problem with a mixture of continuous and discrete decision variables. In this paper, we present a full pipeline based on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and whole-body trajectory optimization (TO) to perform simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection on highly challenging environments. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that our framework can quickly find a diverse set of dynamically consistent plans. We experimentally show that these plans are transferable to a real quadruped robot. We further show that the same framework can find highly complex acyclic humanoid maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection for acyclic multi-contact locomotion using the whole-body dynamics of a quadruped.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseMap: A Sparse Tensor Accelerator Framework Based on Evolution Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12906v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators. However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However, integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times 64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds superior solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of three random field sampling methods for high-resolution Bayesian inversion with application to a plane stress problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12876v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inversion aims to provide uncertainty quantification of posterior estimates conditional on observations. When the inferred parameter is a continuous spatial function, one common strategy is to model it as a random field. Several random field sampling strategies exist. In this article, we investigate three different approaches in terms of numerical efficiency and influence on the posterior distribution. These approaches are based on (i) Karhunen-Loeve and (ii) wavelet expansions, and (iii) local average subdivision. We use the multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to construct posterior estimates with all approaches. This enables a focus on high-dimensional problems discretised on high-resolution finite element grids. As an application, we consider the reconstruction of material parameters in a 2D plane stress model, conditional on static displacement observations. Through these numerical experiments, we deduce that the methods provide comparable posterior estimates and that the local average subdivision method attains slightly better numerical efficiency than the other two approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[An Introduction to Sliced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12519v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.</p></details> | 227 pages |

However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs. For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or research interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff in Inference-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12361v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models, yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately, whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Error Probability Estimation of Nano-scale Combinational Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12345v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As technology scales, nano-scale digital circuits face heightened susceptibility to single event upsets (SEUs) and transients (SETs) due to shrinking feature sizes and reduced operating voltages. While logical, electrical, and timing masking effects influence soft error probability (SEP), the combined impact of process variation (PV) and aging-induced degradation further complicates SEP estimation. Existing approaches often address PV or aging in isolation, or rely on computationally intensive methods like Monte Carlo simulations, limiting their practicality for large-scale circuit optimization. This paper introduces a novel framework for SEP analysis that holistically integrates PV and aging effects. We propose an enhanced electrical masking model and a statistical methodology to quantify soft error probability under process and aging variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy while reducing computational overhead by approximately 2.5% compared to Monte Carlo-based methods. This work advances the design of reliable nano-scale circuits by enabling efficient, accurate SEP estimation in the presence of manufacturing variability and long-term transistor degradation.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Stochastic Orienteering Problems with Chance Constraints Using a GNN Powered Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04653v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the power of a graph neural network (GNN) with message passing, we present a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method to solve stochastic orienteering problems with chance constraints. While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

This equivalence enables a unified route to closed-form point estimators for multi-parameter models that typically lack explicit maximum likelihood (ML) solutions. Within this framework we (i) recover, as special cases, several recent closed-form estimators from the literature; (ii) derive new families of estimators indexed by monotone transformations $g$; and (iii) establish strong consistency and asymptotic normality under mild regularity, including a dominated differentiation condition. As a detailed illustration, we derive closed-form estimators for parameters that index the beta distribution. A Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of proposed and existing estimators. Finally, we illustrate the approach with a novel municipal data set regarding proportions of land used for farming in Roraima (Brazil), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in the literature before, demonstrating the method's practical usefulness.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

In such combined datasets, bilateral outcomes exhibit intra-subject correlation, while unilateral outcomes are assumed independent. We investigate the generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach for testing homogeneity of proportions across multiple groups for the combined unilateral and bilateral data, and compare it with three likelihood-based statistics (likelihood ratio, Wald-type, and score) under Rosner's constant $R$ model and Donner's equal correlation $\rho$ model. Monte Carlo simulations evaluate empirical type I error and power under varied sample sizes and parameter settings. The GEE and score tests show superior type I error control, outperforming likelihood ratio and Wald-type tests. Applications to two real datasets in otolaryngologic and ophthalmologic studies illustrate the methods. We recommend the GEE and score tests for homogeneity testing, and suggest GEE for more complex models with covariates, while favoring the score statistic for small sample exact tests due to its computational efficiency.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 tables |

| **[Quantile estimation of CO2 marginal abatement cost across emission-generating technologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11912v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marginal abatement cost (MAC) is a critical metric for designing efficient and cost-effective mitigation policies. However, existing MAC estimates are typically derived under different assumptions about emission-generating technologies, yet few studies have systematically compared these technologies. Moreover, conventional estimators often exhibit biases arising from limited abatement options, production inefficiencies, and data noise. To address these limitations, this paper analyzes the abatement behavior of three emission-generating technologies: by-production, joint disposability, and weak G-disposability, each consistent with the material balance principle. We employ both full and quantile frontier estimation methods to identify optimal abatement strategies. Using data from U.S. coal-fired power plants in 2022, the empirical results suggest that reducing electricity output, rather than cutting emission-generating inputs such as fossil fuels, provides a more cost-effective mitigation pathway. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the quantile estimator consistently delivers more accurate results than the full frontier estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Importance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03158v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Bayesian inference, the approximation of integrals of the form $\psi = \mathbb{E}_{F}{l(X)} = \int_{\chi} l(\mathbf{x}) d F(\mathbf{x})$ is a fundamental challenge. Such integrals are crucial for evidence estimation, which is important for various purposes, including model selection and numerical analysis. The existing strategies for evidence estimation are classified into four categories: deterministic approximation, density estimation, importance sampling, and vertical representation (Llorente et al., 2020). In this paper, we show that the Riemann sum estimator due to Yakowitz (1978) can be used in the context of nested sampling (Skilling, 2006) to achieve a $O(n^{-4})$ rate of convergence, faster than the usual Ergodic Central Limit Theorem. We provide a brief overview of the literature on the Riemann sum estimators and the nested sampling algorithm and its connections to vertical likelihood Monte Carlo. We provide theoretical and numerical arguments to show how merging these two ideas may result in improved and more robust estimators for evidence estimation, especially in higher dimensional spaces. We also briefly discuss the idea of simulating the Lorenz curve that avoids the problem of intractable $\Lambda$ functions, essential for the vertical representation and nested sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed a few typos and errors, and added a real data example</p></details> |

This scalable method is suitable for image classification and other computationally intensive tasks. Compared to widely used methods such as Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, the MCMC-based Horseshoe prior, and non-Bayesian machine learning methods including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), the Jacobi prior achieves competitive or better accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost. The method is well suited to distributed computing environments, as it naturally accommodates partitioned data across multiple servers. We propose a parallelisable Monte Carlo algorithm to quantify the uncertainty in the estimated coefficients. We establish the theoretical foundations of the Jacobi estimator by studying its asymptotic properties. In particular, we prove a Bernstein--von Mises theorem for the Jacobi posterior. To demonstrate its practical utility, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study comprising seven experiments focused on statistical consistency, prediction accuracy, scalability, sensitivity analysis and robustness study. In the spine classification task, we extract last-layer features from a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model and evaluate multiple classifiers, including Jacobi-Multinomial logit regression, SVM, and Random Forest. The Jacobi prior achieves state-of-the-art results in recall and predictive stability, especially when paired with domain-specific features. This highlights its potential for scalable, high-dimensional learning in medical image analysis.

| **[Approximate Factor Model with S-vine Copula Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11619v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for approximate factor models that integrates an S-vine copula structure to capture complex dependencies among common factors. Our estimation procedure proceeds in two steps: first, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the factors; second, we employ maximum likelihood estimation that combines kernel density estimation for the margins with an S-vine copula to model the dependence structure. Jointly fitting the S-vine copula with the margins yields an oblique factor rotation without resorting to ad hoc restrictions or traditional projection pursuit methods. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the consistency of the rotation and copula parameter estimators, developing asymptotic theory for the factor-projected empirical process under dependent data, and proving the uniform consistency of the projected entropy estimators. Simulation studies demonstrate convergence with respect to both the dimensionality and the sample size. We further assess model performance through Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation via Monte Carlo methods and apply our methodology to the daily returns of S&P 500 Index constituents to forecast the VaR of S&P 500 index.</p></details> | 47 pages |
| **[Nonparametric learning of stochastic differential equations from sparse and noisy data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11597v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper proposes a systematic framework for building data-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE) models from sparse, noisy observations. Unlike traditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the drift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data without strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in scientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly complex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized negative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory segments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte Carlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized empirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a finite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer theorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a hybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify significant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important theoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM sequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of the drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is broadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under observational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of numerical experiments.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

Our results in benchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the performance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of greedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent. The results suggest that landmarks can provide helpful guidance for anytime algorithms solving MDPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

Evaluating uncertainty estimates in binary classification models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11460v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery, especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study, we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss, (iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation-based inference using splitting schemes for partially observed diffusions in chemical reaction networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11438v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of simulation and parameter inference for chemical reaction networks described by the chemical Langevin equation, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation of the dynamics of the chemical species. This is challenging for two main reasons. First, the (multi-dimensional) SDEs cannot be explicitly solved and are driven by multiplicative and non-commutative noise, requiring the development of advanced numerical schemes for their approximation and simulation. Second, not all components of the SDEs are directly observed, as the available discrete-time data are typically incomplete and/or perturbed with measurement error. We tackle these issues via three contributions. First, we show that these models can be rewritten as perturbed conditionally Cox-Ingersoll-Ross-type SDEs, i.e., each coordinate, conditioned on all other coordinates being fixed, follows an SDE with linear drift and square root diffusion coefficient perturbed by additional Brownian motions. Second, for this class of SDEs, we develop a numerical splitting scheme that preserves structural properties of the model, such as oscillations, state space and invariant distributions, unlike the commonly used Euler-Maruyama scheme. Our numerical method is robust for large integration time steps. Third, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm incorporating "data-conditional" simulation and sequential learning of summary statistics, allowing inference for multidimensional partially observed systems, further developing previous results on fully observed systems based on the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We validate our approach on models of interest in chemical reaction networks, such as the stochastic Repressilator, Lotka-Volterra, and two-pool systems, demonstrating its effectiveness, in terms of both numerical and inferential accuracy, and reduced computational cost.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Structured Generative Modeling with the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14167v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers an expressive and interpretable framework for text and image generation. However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient training strategy. We also introduce a training criterion using population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. T-KAM elegantly balances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, high sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact research directions in generative intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Distractor Generation via MCTS-Guided Reasoning Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11184v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[On MCMC mixing for predictive inference under unidentified transformation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01382v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable Bayesian predictive inference has long been an open problem under unidentified transformation models, since the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains of posterior predictive distribution (PPD) values are generally poorly mixed. We address the poorly mixed PPD value chains under unidentified transformation models through an adaptive scheme for prior adjustment. Specifically, we originate a conception of sufficient informativeness, which explicitly quantifies the information level provided by nonparametric priors, and assesses MCMC mixing by comparison with the within-chain MCMC variance. We formulate the prior information level by a set of hyperparameters induced from the nonparametric prior elicitation with an analytic expression, which is guaranteed by asymptotic theory for the posterior variance under unidentified transformation models. The analytic prior information level consequently drives a hyperparameter tuning procedure to achieve MCMC mixing. The proposed method is general enough to cover various data domains through a multiplicative error working model. Comprehensive simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that our method successfully achieves MCMC mixing and outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in predictive capability.</p></details> |  |

The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $<0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 26 figures, 6 tables.

| **[Dynamic Skewness in Stochastic Volatility Models: A Penalized Prior Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10778v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series often exhibit skewness and heavy tails, making it essential to use models that incorporate these characteristics to ensure greater reliability in the results. Furthermore, allowing temporal variation in the skewness parameter can bring significant gains in the analysis of this type of series. However, for more robustness, it is crucial to develop models that balance flexibility and parsimony. In this paper, we propose dynamic skewness stochastic volatility models in the SMSN family (DynSSV-SMSN), using priors that penalize model complexity. Parameter estimation was carried out using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method via the \texttt{RStan} package. Simulation results demonstrated that penalizing priors present superior performance in several scenarios compared to the classical choices. In the empirical application to returns of cryptocurrencies, models with heavy tails and dynamic skewness provided a better fit to the data according to the DIC, WAIC, and LOO-CV information criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo (MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte \textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points, the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32 sampling experiment.</p></details> |  |

First, we conduct a pioneering investigation into the challenges and opportunities for FDI brought about by APU electrification. Our analysis reveals that the electrification of APU opens up new possibilities for utilizing shaft power estimates from starter/generator to improve gas generator FDI. We then provide comprehensive theoretical and analytical evidence demonstrating why, how, and to what extent, the shaft power information from the starter/generator can fundamentally enhance the estimation accuracy of system states and health parameters of the gas generator, while also identifying the key factors influencing these improvements in FDI performance. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and its theoretical foundations are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, through comprehensive comparative analysis with state-of-the-art gas generator fault diagnosis methods, our experimental results not only demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach but also validate that the diagnostic capabilities of existing advanced FDI techniques can be substantially enhanced by incorporating shaft power information. And the observed performance improvement patterns strongly align with our theoretical analysis, verifying both the effectiveness and guiding significance of our theoretical framework. These research findings provide a unique perspective in answering three fundamental questions: why joint fault diagnosis of the starter/generator and gas generator is essential, how it can be implemented, and what factors determine its effectiveness, thereby opening up promising new avenues for FDI technologies in all-electric APU systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10520v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Framework for Prioritizing Unsafe Control Actions in STPA: Case Study on eVTOL Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10446v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a widely recommended method for analysing complex system safety. STPA can identify numerous Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements depending on the level of granularity of the analysis and the complexity of the system being analysed. Managing numerous results is challenging, especially during a fast-paced development lifecycle. Extensive research has been done to optimize the efficiency of managing and prioritising the STPA results. However, maintaining the objectivity of prioritisation and communicating the prioritised results have become common challenges. In this paper, the authors present a complementary approach that incorporates inputs from both the safety analysts and domain experts to more objectively prioritise UCAs. This is done by evaluating the severity of each UCA, the impact factor of each controller or decision maker that issues the UCA, and the ranking provided by the subject matter experts who assess the UCA criticalities based on different factors. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation is introduced to reduce subjectivity and relativity, thus enabling more objective prioritisation of the UCAs. As part of the approach to better communicate the prioritisation results and plan the next steps of system development, a dynamic-scaling prioritisation matrix was developed to capture different sets of prioritised UCAs. The approach was applied to a real project to improve the safe operations of Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL). The results highlighted critical UCAs that need to be prioritised for safer eVTOL operation. 318 UCAs were identified in total. Based on the application of the prioritisation methodology, 110 were recognized as high-priority UCAs to strengthen the system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper, we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge, salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method -- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and interpretable cognitive attack detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rollout Roulette: A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of LLMs using Particle-Based Monte Carlo Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01618v5)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

| **[Identifying Unmeasured Confounders in Panel Causal Models: A Two-Stage LM-Wald Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10342v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panel data are widely used in political science to draw causal inferences. However, these models often rely on the strong and untested assumption of sequential ignorability--that no unmeasured variables influence both the independent and outcome variables across time. Grounded in psychometric literature on latent variable modeling, this paper introduces the Two-Stage LM-Wald (2SLW) approach, a diagnostic tool that extends the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) and Wald tests to detect violations of this assumption in panel causal models. Using Monte Carlo simulations within the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM), which separates within and between person effects, I demonstrate the 2SLW's ability to detect unmeasured confounding across three key scenarios: biased corrections, distorted direct effects, and altered mediation pathways. I also illustrate the approach with an empirical application to real-world panel data. By providing a practical and theoretically grounded diagnostic, the 2SLW approach enhances the robustness of causal inferences in the presence of potential time-varying confounders. Moreover, it can be readily implemented using the R package lavaan.</p></details> |  |

This complexity leads to uncountably infinite treatment-confounder feedbacks, which traditional causal inference methodologies cannot handle. Inspired by the coarsened data framework, we adopt stochastic process theory, measure theory, and net convergence to propose a nonparametric causal identification framework. This framework generalizes classical g-computation, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust formulas, accommodating time-varying outcomes subject to mortality and censoring for functional longitudinal data. We examine our framework through Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach addresses significant gaps in current methodologies, providing a solution for functional longitudinal data and paving the way for future estimation work in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Exploration is hindered by one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent, AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark, MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Emissivity Retrieval from Hyperspectral Data via Physics-Guided Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08291v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given remotely-sensed radiance measurement.</p></details> | 14 figures |

This class of PDMPs adapts the concept of a mirror map from convex optimisation to address sampling problems. Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Non-Reversible Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11743v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution on a constrained domain. We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>feedb...</summary><p>feedback welcome, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[CCS: Controllable and Constrained Sampling with Diffusion Models via Initial Noise Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04670v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks, producing high-quality outputs across diverse domains. However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |

This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Penalized Overdamped and Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00570v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution $\pi(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ when $x$ is constrained to lie on a convex body $\mathcal{C}$. Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Rate Free Sampling in Constrained Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14943v3)** | 2023-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a suite of new particle-based algorithms for sampling in constrained domains which are entirely learning rate free. Our approach leverages coin betting ideas from convex optimisation, and the viewpoint of constrained sampling as a mirrored optimisation problem on the space of probability measures. Based on this viewpoint, we also introduce a unifying framework for several existing constrained sampling algorithms, including mirrored Langevin dynamics and mirrored Stein variational gradient descent. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on a range of numerical examples, including sampling from targets on the simplex, sampling with fairness constraints, and constrained sampling problems in post-selection inference. Our results indicate that our algorithms achieve competitive performance with existing constrained sampling methods, without the need to tune any hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

| **[Unbiased constrained sampling with Self-Concordant Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11925v3)** | 2023-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |

In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |

However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

| **[Learning Equality Constraints for Motion Planning on Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11852v1)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06311v3)** | 2020-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic execution and fuzzing are two complementary coverage-based testing techniques. How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06922v1)** | 2020-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

Conditional generators are one of the successful implementations of such models wherein the created samples are constrained to a specific class. In this work, the application of these networks is extended to regression problems wherein the conditional generator is restrained to any continuous aspect of the data. A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

This is the case e.g. with strictly positive data and with compositional data, like percentages and the like. If the natural measure of difference is not the absolute one, it is possible to use simple algebraic properties to show that it is more convenient to work with a geometry that is not the usual Euclidean geometry in real space, and with a measure which is not the usual Lebesgue measure, leading to alternative models which better fit the phenomenon under study. The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted by the 11th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

| **[On the reconstruction limits of complex networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |

Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, ECAI2025</p></details> |

Focusing on conditions observed over half tidal cycles, we observe that such data fall within the framework of functional extreme value theory, but violate standard assumptions due to temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior.a To address this, we propose a two-stage methodology. First, we introduce an autoregressive model to eliminate temporal dependence between cycles. Second, considering the model residuals, we adapt existing techniques based on Pareto processes. This allows us to build a simulator of extreme scenarios, by applying inverse transformations. These simulations depend on an initial time series, which can be randomly selected to tune the desired level of extremes. We validate the simulator performance by comparing simulated times series with observations, through several criteria, based on principal component analysis, extreme value analysis, and classification algorithms. The approach is applied to the surge data, on the G{\^a}vres site, located in southern Brittany, France.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conditionally specified graphical modeling of stationary multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13572v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models are ubiquitous for summarizing conditional relations in multivariate data. In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model ({\it CEStGM}). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12393v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02177v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework for the simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics. This will be done utilizing the monotone rearrangement and the nonparametric estimation. We capitalize the Gaussian approximation for the nonparametric monotone estimator and construct the asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) using designed bootstrap methods. We investigate two general and practical scenarios. The first is the simultaneous inference of monotone smooth trends from moderately high-dimensional time series. The proposed algorithm has been employed for the joint inference of temperature curves from multiple areas. Specifically, most existing methods are designed for a single monotone smooth trend. In such cases, our proposed SCB empirically exhibits the narrowest width among existing approaches while maintaining confidence levels. It has also been used for testing several hypotheses tailored to global warming. The second scenario involves simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying regression coefficients in time-varying coefficient linear models. The proposed algorithm has been utilized for testing the impact of sunshine duration on temperature which is believed to be increasing due to severe greenhouse effect. The validity of the proposed methods has been justified in theory as well as by extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyze multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyze a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighboring areas.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

Efficient data engineering is critical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern data lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time ingestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support complex use cases.

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.</p></details> |  |

To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 110 tables.

However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Moreover, identification of a model corrupted with heavy-tailed, particularly infinite-variance noise, can be a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian- and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |

Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |

Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing</p></details> |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TFB: Towards Comprehensive and Fair Benchmarking of Time Series Forecasting Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB. We have also launched an online time series leaderboard: https://decisionintelligence.github.io/OpenTS/OpenTS-Bench/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Direc...</summary><p>Directly accepted by PVLDB 2024, VLDB Best Research Paper Award Nomination 2024</p></details> |

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.</p></details> |  |

A carefully chosen set of identification conditions for the common component and the potentially nonstationary main effects is proposed to strengthen the interpretations of sparse main effects, while estimators of all model components are presented. Sparse estimation of the latent main effects is proposed using a doubly adaptive fused lasso estimation to allow for sparse sub-block detection, with theoretical guarantees and rates of convergence spelt out for the final estimators. Sparse block consistency for the main effects is also proved as a result. A realized Mallow's $C_p$ is developed for tuning parameter selection, with practical implementation described. Simulation experiments are performed under a variety of settings, showing our proposed estimators work well. A set of NYC taxi traffic data is analyzed, clearly showing the effects of Covid-19 lockdown, with prolonged sparse main effects detected.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |

This potential is currently hampered by a lack of comprehensible benchmarks for multivariate time series anomaly detection, especially for the challenging case of satellite telemetry. The European Space Agency Benchmark for Anomaly Detection in Satellite Telemetry (ESA-ADB) aims to address this challenge and establish a new standard in the domain. It is a result of close cooperation between spacecraft operations engineers from the European Space Agency (ESA) and machine learning experts. The newly introduced ESA Anomalies Dataset contains annotated real-life telemetry from three different ESA missions, out of which two are included in ESA-ADB. Results of typical anomaly detection algorithms assessed in our novel hierarchical evaluation pipeline show that new approaches are necessary to address operators' needs. All elements of ESA-ADB are publicly available to ensure its full reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>87 pa...</summary><p>87 pages, 24 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bi-Axial Transformers: Addressing the Increasing Complexity of EHR Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12418v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Interpreting Time Series Forecasts with LIME and SHAP: A Case Study on the Air Passengers Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12253v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii) empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSpaformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medical time series (MedTS) classification is essential for effective clinical diagnosis, yet remains challenging due to complex multi-channel temporal dependencies, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics. These results highlight MedSpaformer's robustness and its potential as a unified solution for MedTS classification across diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 9 pages, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Gaussian Processes with Latent Kronecker Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06895v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning 2025</p></details> |

Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series. This yields comprehensive general results that are applicable to various notions of dependence, which is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing series. Especially, we obtain the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions as known for the classical empirical process. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, uniform Lipschitz properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision, and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series forecasters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Wavelet-Based Framework for Mapping Long Memory in Resting-State fMRI: Age-Related Changes in the Hippocampus from the ADHD-200 Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11920v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are known to exhibit long-range temporal dependencies that challenge traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed methodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI and offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory and brain development.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSenCLIP: A Vision-Language Model for Remote Sensing Using Single-Pixel Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11919v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[BRIEF: BRain-Inspired network connection search with Extensive temporal feature Fusion enhances disease classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11732v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09630v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However, due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Models for Joint Selection of Features and Auto-Regressive Lags: Theory and Applications in Environmental and Financial Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10055v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01532v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical systems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor reconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.</p></details> |  |

Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy.

Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Investigation into Configuring Echo State Networks for Representative Benchmark Problem Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10887v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.</p></details> | 49 pages, 21 figures |
| **[On the Gaussian distribution of the Mann-Kendall tau in the case of autocorrelated data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10842v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-parametric Mann-Kendall tests for autocorrelated data rely on the assumption that the distribution of the normalized Mann-Kendall tau is Gaussian. While this assumption holds asymptotically for stationary autoregressive processes of order 1 (AR(1)) and simple moving average (SMA) processes when sampling over an increasingly long period, it often fails for finite-length time series. In such cases, the empirical distribution of the Mann-Kendall tau deviates significantly from the Gaussian distribution. To assess the validity of this assumption, we explore an alternative asymptotic framework for AR(1) and SMA processes. We prove that, along upsampling sequences, the distribution of the normalized Mann-Kendall tau does not converge to a Gaussian but instead to a bounded distribution with strictly positive variance. This asymptotic behavior suggests scaling laws which determine the conditions under which the Gaussian approximation remains valid for finite-length time series generated by stationary AR(1) and SMA processes. Using Shapiro-Wilk tests, we numerically confirm the departure from normality and establish simple, practical criteria for assessing the validity of the Gaussian assumption, which depend on both the autocorrelation structure and the series length. Finally, we illustrate these findings with examples from existing studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendices, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Our prior work, TransFed, introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based federated systems.

Furthermore, allowing temporal variation in the skewness parameter can bring significant gains in the analysis of this type of series. However, for more robustness, it is crucial to develop models that balance flexibility and parsimony. In this paper, we propose dynamic skewness stochastic volatility models in the SMSN family (DynSSV-SMSN), using priors that penalize model complexity. Parameter estimation was carried out using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method via the \texttt{RStan} package. Simulation results demonstrated that penalizing priors present superior performance in several scenarios compared to the classical choices. In the empirical application to returns of cryptocurrencies, models with heavy tails and dynamic skewness provided a better fit to the data according to the DIC, WAIC, and LOO-CV information criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

We propose a training methodology that enables forecasting models to adapt their focus to application-specific regions of interest at inference time, without retraining. The approach partitions the prediction space into fine-grained segments during training, which are dynamically reweighted and aggregated to emphasize the target range specified by the application. Unlike prior methods that predefine these ranges, our framework supports flexible, on-demand adjustments. Experiments on standard benchmarks and a newly collected wireless communication dataset demonstrate that our method not only improves forecast accuracy within regions of interest but also yields measurable gains in downstream task performance. These results highlight the potential for closer integration between predictive modeling and decision-making in real-world systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Language Overrules: Revealing Text Dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10552v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities, including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of 0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum Entropy Models for Unimodal Time Series: Case Studies of Universe 25 and St. Matthew Island](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10518v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a maximum entropy modeling framework for unimodal time series: signals that begin at a reference level, rise to a single peak, and return. Such patterns are commonly observed in ecological collapse, population dynamics, and resource depletion. Traditional dynamical models are often inapplicable in these settings due to limited or sparse data, frequently consisting of only a single historical trajectory. In addition, standard fitting approaches can introduce structural bias, particularly near the mode, where most interpretive focus lies. Using the maximum entropy principle, we derive a least-biased functional form constrained only by minimal prior knowledge, such as the starting point and estimated end. This leads to analytically tractable and interpretable models. We apply this method to the collapse of the Universe 25 mouse population and the reindeer crash on St. Matthew Island. These case studies demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the approach in fitting diverse unimodal time series with minimal assumptions. We also conduct a cross-comparison against established models, including the Richards, Skewnormal, and Generalized Gamma functions. While models typically fit their own generated data best, the maximum entropy models consistently achieve the lowest off-diagonal root-mean-square losses, indicating superior generalization. These results suggest that maximum entropy methods provide a unifying and efficient alternative to mechanistic models when data is limited and generalization is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Non p...</summary><p>Non peer-reviewed preprint.

| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |

Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.

While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |

Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike most existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for empirical applications even with nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. Furthermore, our method mitigates the distributional bias common among many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. We establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering both linear and nonlinear time series and an analysis on a real-world groundwater dataset, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Self- and semi-supervised learning methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods -- statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal" and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 5 figures, Submission for ACM TKDD</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Lag Transformer based on Time-Variable-Aware Learning for Explainable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16896v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is a key element of big data analytics, commonly found in domains such as finance, healthcare, climate forecasting, and transportation. In large scale real world settings, such data is often high dimensional and multivariate, requiring advanced forecasting methods that are both accurate and interpretable. Although Transformer based models perform well in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), their lack of explainability limits their use in critical applications. To overcome this, we propose Distributed Lag Transformer (DLFormer), a novel Transformer architecture for explainable and scalable MTSF. DLFormer integrates a distributed lag embedding and a time variable aware learning (TVAL) mechanism to structurally model both local and global temporal dependencies and explicitly capture the influence of past variables on future outcomes. Experiments on ten benchmark and real world datasets show that DLFormer achieves state of the art predictive accuracy while offering robust, interpretable insights into variable wise and temporal dynamics. These results highlight ability of DLFormer to bridge the gap between performance and explainability, making it highly suitable for practical big data forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements. Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable. Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising, the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures; KDD '25</p></details> |

| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zobrist Hash-based Duplicate Detection in Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13859v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\% speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy based on cached information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence: Towards Improving the Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13678v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related to this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |
| **[LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |
| **[SymMatika: Structure-Aware Symbolic Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03110v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates on the Nguyen and Feynman benchmark suites, an impressive recovery rate of 61\% on Nguyen-12 compared to the next best 2\%, and strong placement on the error-complexity Pareto fronts on the Feynman equations and on a subset of 57 SRBench Black-box problems. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning remains a core challenge for language models (LMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we focus on synthesis of single-invocation recursion-free functions conforming to a specification given as a logical formula in the presence of uncomputable symbols (i.e., symbols used in the specification but not allowed in the resulting function). We approach the problem via SMT-solving methods: we present a quantifier elimination algorithm using model-based projections for both total and partial function synthesis, working with theories of uninterpreted functions and linear arithmetic and their combination. For this purpose we also extend model-based projection to produce witnesses for these theories. Further, we present procedures tailored for the case of uniquely determined solutions. We implemented a prototype of the algorithms using the SMT-solver Z3, demonstrating their practical efficiency compared to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of this paper accepted for FMCAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Non-Iterative Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12425v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought (CoT), an improved approach to standard CoT, for logical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe Autonomous Driving Policies using a Neuro-Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01316v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logic (DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and symbolic first-order logic (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in a highway driving scenario using the HighD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and exhibits better generalizability to new highway driving scenarios compared to traditional DRL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Symbolic RL Planning into a BDI-based Autonomous UAV Framework: System Integration and SIL Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11890v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern autonomous drone missions increasingly require software frameworks capable of seamlessly integrating structured symbolic planning with adaptive reinforcement learning (RL). Although traditional rule-based architectures offer robust structured reasoning for drone autonomy, their capabilities fall short in dynamically complex operational environments that require adaptive symbolic planning. Symbolic RL (SRL), using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), explicitly integrates domain-specific knowledge and operational constraints, significantly improving the reliability and safety of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) decision making. In this study, we propose the AMAD-SRL framework, an extended and refined version of the Autonomous Mission Agents for Drones (AMAD) cognitive multi-agent architecture, enhanced with symbolic reinforcement learning for dynamic mission planning and execution. We validated our framework in a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) environment structured identically to an intended Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) platform, ensuring seamless transition to real hardware. Experimental results demonstrate stable integration and interoperability of modules, successful transitions between BDI-driven and symbolic RL-driven planning phases, and consistent mission performance. Specifically, we evaluate a target acquisition scenario in which the UAV plans a surveillance path followed by a dynamic reentry path to secure the target while avoiding threat zones. In this SIL evaluation, mission efficiency improved by approximately 75% over a coverage-based baseline, measured by travel distance reduction. This study establishes a robust foundation for handling complex UAV missions and discusses directions for further enhancement and validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Symbol-like Number Variables in Artificial Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06141v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What types of numeric representations emerge in neural systems, and what would a satisfying answer to this question look like? In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based number tasks using a variety of methods to understand how well we can interpret them through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs) -- precise programs describable by rules and typed, mutable variables. We use autoregressive GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained on tasks where the correct tokens depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret raw NN activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the activity in terms of neural subspaces rather than individual neurons. Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), we find that, depending on network architecture, dimensionality, and task specifications, alignments with SA's can be very high, or they can be only approximate, or fail altogether. We extend our analytic toolkit to address the failure cases by expanding the DAS framework to a broader class of alignment functions that more flexibly capture NN activity in terms of interpretable variables from SAs, and we provide theoretic and empirical explorations of Linear Alignment Functions (LAFs) in contrast to the preexisting Orthogonal Alignment Functions (OAFs). Through analyses of specific cases we confirm the usefulness of causal interventions on neural subspaces for NN interpretability, and we show that recurrent models can develop graded, symbol-like number variables in their neural activity. We further show that shallow Transformers learn very different solutions than recurrent networks, and we prove that such models must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that do not rely on cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioral and Symbolic Fillers as Delay Mitigation for Embodied Conversational Agents in Virtual Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11781v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When communicating with embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in virtual reality, there might be delays in the responses of the agents lasting several seconds, for example, due to more extensive computations of the answers when large language models are used. Such delays might lead to unnatural or frustrating interactions. In this paper, we investigate filler types to mitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of the agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate with ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the delays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and gestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic indicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other one external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the behavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of presence, humanlikeness, and naturalness. Participants looked away from the face more often when symbolic indicators were displayed, but the visualizations did not lead to a more positive impression of the agent or to increased presence. The majority of participants preferred the behavioral fillers, only 12.5% and 4.2% favored the symbolic embedded and external conditions, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |

In this paper, we describe how real digital dictionaries can be embedded into AMR directed graphs (digraphs), using state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models. Then, we reduce those graphs in a confluent manner, i.e. with transformations that preserve their circuit space. Finally, the properties of these reduces digraphs are analyzed and discussed in relation to the symbol grounding problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point or Line? Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23395v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finetuning Large Language Model as an Effective Symbolic Regressor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09897v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treating complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises 148,102 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference. Further, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish SymbolicChat, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental results validate SymbolicChat as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 8.37% in form-level consistency score.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does a Virtual Agent Decide Where to Look? -- Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning for Embodied Head Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08930v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema, and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while retaining behavioral plausibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-head Transformers Provably Learn Symbolic Multi-step Reasoning via Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08222v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for consideration of publication in May</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic Quantile Regression for the Interpretable Prediction of Conditional Quantiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08080v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable. Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting feature influences at varying quantiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Acceleration of MILP Motion Planning with Temporal Logic and Chance Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07515v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems must solve motion planning problems subject to increasingly complex, time-sensitive, and uncertain missions. These problems often involve high-level task specifications, such as temporal logic or chance constraints, which require solving large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing MILP-based planning methods suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, hindering their real-time applicability. We propose to use a neuro-symbolic approach to accelerate MILP-based motion planning by leveraging machine learning techniques to guide the solver's symbolic search. Focusing on two representative classes of planning problems, namely, those with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and those with chance constraints formulated via Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP). We demonstrate how graph neural network-based learning methods can guide traditional symbolic MILP solvers in solving challenging planning problems, including branching variable selection and solver parameter configuration. Through extensive experiments, we show that neuro-symbolic search techniques yield scalability gains. Our approach yields substantial improvements, achieving an average performance gain of about 20% over state-of-the-art solver across key metrics, including runtime and solution quality.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Evaluation and Selection of Unsupervised Pretext Tasks from a Neuro-Symbolic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07299v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning (SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model, knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation method.</p></details> |  |

Path explosion, where the number of states to track becomes unwieldy, is one of the biggest challenges hindering symbolic execution's practical application. To combat this, researchers have employed various strategies to enable symbolic execution on complex software systems. This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of these strategies, categorizing them into two primary approaches: Scope Reduction, which aims to reduce the scope of symbolic execution to manageable portions of code, and Guidance Heuristics, which steer the symbolic execution engine toward promising paths. Using this taxonomy as a lens, we survey applications of symbolic executions in several domains such as vulnerability analysis, malware analysis, firmware re-hosting, and network protocol analysis. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including the application of symbolic execution to real-time operating systems and modern, type-safe languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: A...</summary><p>v2: Adds a subsection to Future Directions discussing the role of LLMs in symbolic execution</p></details> |
| **[Structural Perturbation in Large Language Model Representations through Recursive Symbolic Regeneration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05794v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic perturbations offer a novel approach for influencing neural representations without requiring direct modification of model parameters. The recursive regeneration of symbolic structures introduces structured variations in latent embeddings, leading to controlled shifts in attention dynamics and lexical diversity across sequential generations. A comparative analysis with conventional fine-tuning techniques reveals that structural modifications at the symbolic level induce distinct variations in contextual sensitivity while maintaining overall model fluency and coherence. Shifts in attention weight distributions highlight the role of symbolic modifications in adjusting token dependencies, influencing response variability, and refining long-form text generation. Experimental findings suggest that symbolic perturbations can enhance adaptability in domain-specific applications, allowing modifications in model behavior without retraining. Evaluations of semantic drift indicate that recursive regeneration alters long-range token dependencies, affecting topic coherence across extended text sequences. Results from lexical variability assessments further support the conclusion that symbolic-level modifications introduce interpretable variations in generated responses, potentially enabling more controlled stylistic adjustments in automated text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Tree-Based Deep Learning for Ranking Symbolic Integration Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06383v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic indefinite integration in Computer Algebra Systems such as Maple involves selecting the most effective algorithm from multiple available methods. Not all methods will succeed for a given problem, and when several do, the results, though mathematically equivalent, can differ greatly in presentation complexity. Traditionally, this choice has been made with minimal consideration of the problem instance, leading to inefficiencies. We present a machine learning (ML) approach using tree-based deep learning models within a two-stage architecture: first identifying applicable methods for a given instance, then ranking them by predicted output complexity. Furthermore, we find representing mathematical expressions as tree structures significantly improves performance over sequence-based representations, and our two-stage framework outperforms alternative ML formulations. Using a diverse dataset generated by six distinct data generators, our models achieve nearly 90% accuracy in selecting the optimal method on a 70,000 example holdout test set. On an independent out-of-distribution benchmark from Maple's internal test suite, our tree transformer model maintains strong generalisation, outperforming Maple's built-in selector and prior ML approaches. These results highlight the critical role of data representation and problem framing in ML for symbolic computation, and we expect our methodology to generalise effectively to similar optimisation problems in mathematical software.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, submitted to Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Meta-SR: In-Context Learning for Evolving Selection Operators in Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18602v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a meta learning framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: a lack of semantic guidance and code bloat. The absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, and bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator and bloat control. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the evolved operator can further improve the state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithm, achieving the best performance among 26 symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms across 116 regression datasets. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Values to Tokens: An LLM-Driven Framework for Context-aware Time Series Forecasting via Symbolic Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09191v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-as-Symbolic-Planner: Foundation Model-Based Robot Planning via Symbolic Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01700v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robot task and motion planning (TAMP). Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for research on the symbolic basis of human thought.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs. The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Visual Plans from Unlabeled Videos via Symbolic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08444v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual planning, by offering a sequence of intermediate visual subgoals to a goal-conditioned low-level policy, achieves promising performance on long-horizon manipulation tasks. To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Inputs for Grammar Mining using Dynamic Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03832v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process structured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid, this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First, the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature. Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01', `10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8469 etc.). Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression, which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information processing.</p></details> | 4 figures, 3 tables |
| **[Metasurface-Enabled Superheterodyne Transmitter for Arbitrary-Order Modulation with Spatially Isotropic Symbol Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01863v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetically programmable information metasurfaces, as dynamically controllable 2D metamaterials, hold significant promise as low-profile hardware enabling passive wave control and signal generation for backscatter systems. However, current metasurface-based transmitters architecture fundamentally suffer from hardware non-modularization, forcing all transmitter functions onto nonlinear switch-based unit cells, which introduces symbol mapping inconsistency via phase coupling. Moreover, both temporal coding (limited by unit cell diodes) and space-time coding (impaired by symbol anisotropy) exhibit irreducible harmonic interference and entangled control of amplitude, phase, and beam direction. This paper proposes a metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA), comprising a digital up-conversion (DUC) module performing baseband-to-intermediate frequency (IF) conversion, filtering, and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and a reconfigurable metasurface featuring programmable unit cells that independently control both the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient. Systematically, the architecture leverages a dual-stage up-conversion process, typical of superheterodyne systems, but uniquely employs the metasurface for the final RF conversion stage. Building upon this framework, a proof-of-concept prototype featuring a 5.8 GHz magnitude-phase decoupled (MPD) metasurface (<15 degree phase deviation per state) and a DAC-based DUC module is presented. Extensive validation confirms the metasurface's capability for distortion-free mixing with arbitrary IF signals while maintaining consistent radiation patterns. The prototype successfully implements diverse QAM modulation schemes (4QAM to 256QAM) in mono-static and bi-static configurations, demonstrating symbol isotropy for spatially separated receivers and achieving a data rate of approximately 20 Mbps (at 5 MHz IF)...</p></details> |  |
| **[CloudAnoAgent: Anomaly Detection for Cloud Sites via LLM Agent with Neuro-Symbolic Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01844v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Finite-State Symbolic Automaton Model for the Collatz Map and Its Convergence Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21728v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a finite-state, deterministic automaton that emulates the Collatz function through digitwise transitions on base-10 representations. Each digit is represented as a symbolic triplet (r, p, c) encoding its value, the parity of the next digit, and an incoming carry propagated from the lower digit. This yields exactly 60 possible local states. The automaton applies local, parity-aware rules that collectively reconstruct the global arithmetic of the Collatz map. We show that all symbolic trajectories converge in finitely many steps to a unique terminal cycle (4, 0, 0) -> (2, 0, 0) -> (1, 0, 0), with all higher digit positions degenerating to the absorbing state (0, 0, 0). This collapse reveals a canonical symbolic normal form of Collatz dynamics. In parallel, a binary view explains the dynamics as alternating bit-length growth and contraction, aligning with known heuristics for Collatz convergence. This structural perspective is further reinforced by a symbolic drift function and a ranking potential that together explain and formalize the convergence process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Updated automaton diagrams, outlining support for affine maps T(n) = an + b, and a new section on binary symbolic drift explaining convergence.

| **[A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.</p></details> | version 3 |
| **[Via Score to Performance: Efficient Human-Controllable Long Song Generation with Bar-Level Symbolic Notation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01394v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC; nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation. Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its superiority across multiple subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.</p></details> |  |

While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability.

This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desyan: A Platform for Seamless Value-Flow and Symbolic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00508v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, two different types of static analyses have emerged as dominant paradigms both in academia and industry: value-flow analysis (e.g., data-flow analysis or points-to analysis) and symbolic analysis (e.g., symbolic execution). Despite their individual successes in numerous application fields, the two approaches have remained largely separate; an artifact of the simple reality that there is no broadly adopted unifying platform for effortless and efficient integration of symbolic techniques with high-performance data-flow reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce Desyan: a platform for writing program analyses with seamless integration of value-flow and symbolic reasoning. Desyan expands a production-ready Datalog fixpoint engine (Souffl\'e) with full-fledged SMT solving invoking industry-leading SMT engines. Desyan provides constructs for automatically (and efficiently!) handling typical patterns that come up in program analysis. At the same time, the integration is agnostic with respect to the solving technology, and supports Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, via a bottom-up algebraic reasoning module. The result is an engine that allows blending different kinds of reasoning, as needed for the underlying analysis. For value-flow analysis, the engine is the best-in-class Datalog evaluator (often by a factor of over 20x in execution time); for applications that require full SMT (e.g., a concolic execution engine or other symbolic evaluator that needs to solve arbitrarily complex conditions), the engine is leveraging the leading SMT solvers; for lightweight symbolic evaluation (e.g., solving simple conditionals in the context of a path-sensitive analysis), the engine can use Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, achieving large speedups (often of over 2x) compared to eagerly appealing to an SMT solver.</p></details> |  |

However, this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the ``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.</p></details> |  |

We built a neural-symbolic system, called FGeo-HyperGNet, to automatically perform human-like geometric problem solving. The symbolic component is a formal system built on FormalGeo, which can automatically perform geometric relational reasoning and algebraic calculations and organize the solution into a hypergraph with conditions as hypernodes and theorems as hyperedges. The neural component, called HyperGNet, is a hypergraph neural network based on the attention mechanism, including an encoder to encode the structural and semantic information of the hypergraph and a theorem predictor to provide guidance in solving problems. The neural component predicts theorems according to the hypergraph, and the symbolic component applies theorems and updates the hypergraph, thus forming a predict-apply cycle to ultimately achieve readable and traceable automatic solving of geometric problems. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural-symbolic architecture. We achieved state-of-the-art results with a TPA of 93.50% and a PSSR of 88.36% on the FormalGeo7K dataset.

This is demonstrated by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used SonarQube static analyzer. Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment, agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as Agentless to improve their output.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Probabilistic Reasoning on Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21873v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

These theories could serve as a building block to specify cryptographic primitive implementations and automatically discover attacks as binary circuits in the symbolic model. We provide proofs of equivalence between this class of equational theories and Boolean logic up to circuit size 3 and we provide the variant complexities and performance benchmarks using Maude-NPA. This is the first result in this direction and follow-up research is needed to improve the scalability of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable Approach to Probabilistic Neuro-Symbolic Robustness Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03274v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy AI) has emerged as a promising direction for integrating neural learning with symbolic reasoning. Typically, in the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete. In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Proof Generation with LLMs: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14479v4)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p></details> | long paper |
| **[DEM-NeRF: A Neuro-Symbolic Method for Scientific Discovery through Physics-Informed Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21350v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular, neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences, without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods, boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Neural Networks: Symbolic Reasoning over Wavelet Logic Graph Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21190v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients. Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled, interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures for learning on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Symbolic Music Generation with Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20128v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved symbolic music generation. However, most approaches rely on transformer-based architectures with self-attention mechanisms, which are constrained by quadratic computational complexity, limiting scalability for long sequences. To address this, we propose Symbolic Music Diffusion with Mamba (SMDIM), a novel diffusion-based architecture integrating Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient global context modeling and the Mamba-FeedForward-Attention Block (MFA) for precise local detail preservation. The MFA Block combines the linear complexity of Mamba layers, the non-linear refinement of FeedForward layers, and the fine-grained precision of self-attention mechanisms, achieving a balance between scalability and musical expressiveness. SMDIM achieves near-linear complexity, making it highly efficient for long-sequence tasks. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including FolkDB, a collection of traditional Chinese folk music that represents an underexplored domain in symbolic music generation, SMDIM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Beyond symbolic music, SMDIM's architectural design demonstrates adaptability to a broad range of long-sequence generation tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for coherent sequence modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages,3figures |

The key insight is to leverage an LLM to automatically generate vulnerability patterns and translate them into detection queries. Specifically, MoCQ incorporates an iterative loop in which an LLM refines queries based on carefully designed feedback information. The resulting queries are then executed to analyze large codebases and detect vulnerabilities. We evaluated MoCQ on 12 vulnerability types across four programming languages. MoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-developed queries, with significantly less expert time needed. MoCQ also uncovered 46 new vulnerability patterns that experts missed, each representing an overlooked vulnerability class. MoCQ further discovered seven previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning neuro-symbolic convergent term rewriting systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19372v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself. We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router, a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 31 figures.

| **[Agentic Program Repair from Test Failures at Scale: A Neuro-symbolic approach with static analysis and test execution feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18755v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale across diverse software offerings internally. Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes. Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator, the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness (neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of 42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations. Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated fixes). Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good starting point.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17482v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space. Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as "black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems, requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible, adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise, interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |

| **[Fast Task Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15975v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few "important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.</p></details> |  |

However, its nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.</p></details> |  |

It aims to enable users to drive generative software development using only natural language requirements. However, since end-users often lack knowledge of software engineering, their requirement descriptions are frequently ambiguous, raising significant challenges to generative software development. Although existing approaches utilize structured languages like Gherkin to clarify user narratives, they still struggle to express the causal logic between preconditions and behavior actions. This paper introduces RequireCEG, a requirement elicitation and self-review agent that embeds causal-effect graphs (CEGs) in a neuro-symbolic collaboration architecture. RequireCEG first uses a feature tree to analyze user narratives hierarchically, clearly defining the scope of software components and their system behavior requirements. Next, it constructs the self-healing CEGs based on the elicited requirements, capturing the causal relationships between atomic preconditions and behavioral actions. Finally, the constructed CEGs are used to review and optimize Gherkin scenarios, ensuring consistency between the generated Gherkin requirements and the system behavior requirements elicited from user narratives. To evaluate our method, we created the RGPair benchmark dataset and conducted extensive experiments. It achieves an 87% coverage rate and raises diversity by 51.88%.</p></details> |  |

Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.</p></details> |  |

However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards.

| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.</p></details> |  |

First, we show that it can predict compact formulas for complex functions not seen during training, given their full truth table. Then, we demonstrate that even with incomplete or noisy observations, Boolformer is still able to find good approximate expressions. We evaluate Boolformer on a broad set of real-world binary classification datasets, demonstrating its potential as an interpretable alternative to classic machine learning methods. Finally, we apply it to the widespread task of modeling the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and show through a benchmark that Boolformer is competitive with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude.

| **[Neural Network-Guided Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Descriptor Discovery in Perovskite Catalysts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12404v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Given a discrete-time control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins. We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform (state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

Additionally, symbolic anchors such as photos or personalized content may serve as memory cues to reinforce digital engagement. This study explores how these mechanisms support technology use in dementia care within the South Korean context. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 11 professional caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with cognitive decline. Grounded theory methods guided the analysis, using iterative coding and constant comparison to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that familiar digital routines (e.g., taking photos) persisted through procedural memory. Symbolic anchors such as family photos or recognizable icons enhanced interaction and emotional engagement. However, unfamiliar or anthropomorphic technologies often triggered fear or symbolic resistance. DISCUSSION: Findings highlight the dual role of procedural memory and symbolic anchors in sustaining digital engagement. Designing culturally responsive and cognitively accessible technologies may enhance autonomy and well-being in dementia care.

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantial change to previous version (experiments, theorem, analysis and related work); currently under review at TMLR</p></details> |

The worst-case analysis (WCA) problem is an optimization-based abstraction of this task. Fuzzing and symbolic execution are widely used techniques for addressing the WCA problem. However, improving code coverage in fuzzing or managing path explosion in symbolic execution within the context of WCA poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose PathFuzzing, aiming to combine the strengths of both techniques to design a WCA method. The key idea is to transform a program into a symbolic one that takes an execution path (encoded as a binary string) and interprets the bits as branch decisions. PathFuzzing then applies evolutionary fuzzing techniques to the transformed program to search for binary strings that represent satisfiable path conditions and lead to high resource consumption. We evaluate the performance of PathFuzzing experimentally on a benchmark suite that consists of prior work's benchmarks and some added by us. Results show that PathFuzzing generally outperforms a fuzzing and a symbolic-execution baseline.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

However, manual annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We present SymRAG, a framework that introduces adaptive query routing via real-time complexity and load assessment to select symbolic, neural, or hybrid pathways. SymRAG's neuro-symbolic approach adjusts computational pathways based on both query characteristics and system load, enabling efficient resource allocation across diverse query types. By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6--100.0% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6--6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985--3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169--1151%, showing its significance for complex models. These results suggest adaptive computation strategies are more sustainable and scalable for hybrid AI systems that use dynamic routing and neuro-symbolic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025)</p></details> |

However, these accelerators face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity, especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput, and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.

| **[LLM4VV: Evaluating Cutting-Edge LLMs for Generation and Evaluation of Directive-Based Parallel Programming Model Compiler Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet. Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.</p></details> |  |
| **[PC-Sampler: Position-Aware Calibration of Decoding Bias in Masked Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13021v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless, our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling (PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/PC-Sampler.</p></details> | 17 pages,13 figures |

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore, EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted problems. Code and resources are available at:https://github.com/SYSUSELab/EvolMathEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Intent to Execution: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reinforcement Learning for Precise CAD Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10118v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing reasoning datasets often either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book), containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus, and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-4B models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-G1: Towards General Vision Language Reasoning with Multi-Domain Data Curation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12680v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface, medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks, outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yuh-zha/Vision-G1.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGR2: Language Guided Reward Relabeling for Accelerating Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05881v4)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation. However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thyme: Think Beyond Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11630v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept, recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and computational operations via executable code. This approach not only facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations, all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation, followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20 benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains, particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thyme-vl.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning.

| **[Making Qwen3 Think in Korean with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10355v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.</p></details> |  |
| **[URO-Bench: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation for End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17810v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in end-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs). In contrast to text-based LLMs, the evaluation framework for SDMs should encompass both cognitive dimensions (e.g., logical reasoning, knowledge) and speech-related aspects (e.g., paralinguistic cues, audio quality). However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To address this gap, we propose URO-Bench, an extensive benchmark for SDMs. Notably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is divided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, each comprising 20 test sets, evaluating the spoken dialogue model's abilities in Understanding, Reasoning, and Oral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed benchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA tasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in advanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding remains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. We hope that URO-Bench can facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models by providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track progress in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models using Confidence Disparities in Coreference Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07111v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns. Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly, coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers, indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social harm.</p></details> |  |

But how can these advances be directed toward empowering junior researchers and designers who often require additional help to build and express their professional and personal identities? We introduce Frontend Diffusion, a multi-agent coding system transforming user-drawn layouts and textual prompts into refined website code, thereby supporting self-representation goals. A user study with 13 junior researchers and designers shows AI as a human capability enhancer rather than a replacement, and highlights the importance of bidirectional human-AI alignment. We then discuss future work such as leveraging AI for career development and fostering bidirectional human-AI alignment of multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GreenMind: A Next-Generation Vietnamese Large Language Model for Structured and Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16832v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a robust approach for tackling LLM tasks that require intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating a final answer. In this paper, we present GreenMind-Medium-14B-R1, the Vietnamese reasoning model inspired by the finetuning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. We also leverage a high-quality Vietnamese synthesized reasoning dataset and design two reward functions to tackle the main limitations of this technique: (i) language mixing, where we explicitly detect the presence of biased language characters during the process of sampling tokens, and (ii) we leverage Sentence Transformer-based models to ensure that the generated reasoning content maintains factual correctness and does not distort the final output. Experimental results on the Vietnamese dataset from the VLSP 2023 Challenge demonstrate that our model outperforms prior works and enhances linguistic consistency in its responses. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation to SeaExam-a multilingual multiple-choice dataset, showing the effectiveness of our reasoning method compared to few-shot prompting techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextGuard-LVLM: Enhancing News Veracity through Fine-grained Cross-modal Contextual Consistency Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06623v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem, which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this, we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.</p></details> |  |

A model modified through this framework demonstrated improved perplexity scores, greater lexical variability, and enhanced consistency in logical reasoning, suggesting that structured parameter distribution contributes to more efficient language representation. Statistical analyses of generated text highlighted a wider range of sentence structures and reduced redundancy in token selection, indicating that encapsulation fosters more adaptable language generation. A detailed evaluation of attention weight distributions revealed that the experimental model exhibited greater divergence in cross-layer activations, supporting the hypothesis that encapsulated neurons assume specialized processing roles. Logical consistency assessments further demonstrated that modular architectures mitigate contradictory outputs, reducing internal conflicts in inferred relationships between linguistic constructs. Computational trade-offs were analyzed, with results showing a minor increase in processing overhead, though improvements in parameter efficiency and structured decision-making compensated for the additional complexity. The mathematical formulation of the encapsulation mechanism confirmed that modular aggregation maintains stable convergence properties while promoting distinct functional roles for different neuron clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[SABER: Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10026v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning (LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4% and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoLaux: A Benchmark for Evaluating MLLMs' Geometry Performance on Long-Step Problems Requiring Auxiliary Lines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06226v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation, and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs' long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51 reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13 leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop). Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in supplementary materials and will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Method-Based Reasoning for Large Language Models: Extraction, Reuse, and Continuous Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04289v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of language tasks. However, their reasoning process is primarily guided by statistical patterns in training data, which limits their ability to handle novel problems and perform consistent logical reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method-based model that enhances LLMs with explicit, reusable procedures extracted from training content, generated responses, and user interactions. Each method is represented as a pair consisting of a problem and its corresponding solution, stored externally and ranked based on feedback. When a new query is received, the system retrieves and applies the most relevant methods to guide the LLM's response. Our model enables continual learning, method reuse, and logical consistency beyond next-token prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the system improves factual verification and generalization in complex prompts, and that newly learned methods can outperform earlier ones through user-driven refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI for Object-Oriented Programming: Writing the Right Code and Reasoning the Right Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05005v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine, and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately enhancing the programming experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization, particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective strategy for strengthening SLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Recommendation with Simulated Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14147v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in explainable recommendation have greatly bolstered user experience by elucidating the decision-making rationale. However, the existing methods actually fail to provide effective feedback signals for potentially better or worse generated explanations due to their reliance on traditional supervised learning paradigms in sparse interaction data. To address these issues, we propose a novel human-like feedback-driven optimization framework. This framework employs a dynamic interactive optimization mechanism for achieving human-centered explainable requirements without incurring high labor costs. Specifically, we propose to utilize large language models (LLMs) as human simulators to predict human-like feedback for guiding the learning process. To enable the LLMs to deeply understand the task essence and meet user's diverse personalized requirements, we introduce a human-induced customized reward scoring method, which helps stimulate the language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, considering the potential conflicts between different perspectives of explanation quality, we introduce a principled Pareto optimization that transforms the multi-perspective quality enhancement task into a multi-objective optimization problem for improving explanation performance. At last, to achieve efficient model training, we design an off-policy optimization pipeline. By incorporating a replay buffer and addressing the data distribution biases, we can effectively improve data utilization and enhance model generality. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15787v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04339v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field.

| **[A Comparative Study of Neurosymbolic AI Approaches to Interpretable Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03366v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeSy 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IJCAI 2025 (CCF A)</p></details> |
| **[From Query to Logic: Ontology-Driven Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01424v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23541v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Categorical Construction of Logically Verifiable Neural Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11647v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with reliable logical reasoning, often violating basic logical principles during inference. We address this limitation by developing a categorical framework that systematically constructs neural architectures with provable logical guarantees. Our approach treats logical theories as algebraic structures called Lawvere theories, which we transform into neural networks using categorical algebra in the 2-category of parametric maps. Unlike existing methods that impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints, enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop Invariant Generation: A Hybrid Framework of Reasoning optimised LLMs and SMT Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00419v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100% coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133, while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be generalizable to other imperative languages.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EVINET: Towards Open-World Graph Learning via Evidential Reasoning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07288v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

| **[Socrates or Smartypants: Testing Logic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models with Logic Programming-based Test Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12312v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset, model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, work in progress</p></details> |

However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[On the Limits of Hierarchically Embedded Logic in Classical Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness. This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination, repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in future development of language models.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning through Visual and Textual Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.</p></details> |  |

Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences. Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes, for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation. Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts, including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters, and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices, integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes. Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA)</p></details> |

However, challenges persist within theorem proving, such as the identification of key mathematical concepts, understanding their interrelationships, and formalizing proofs correctly within natural language. We present KG-prover, a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs mined from reputable mathematical texts to augment general-purpose LLMs to construct and formalize mathematical proofs. We also study the effects of scaling graph-based, test-time compute using KG-Prover, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines across multiple datasets. General-purpose LLMs improve up to 21\% on miniF2F-test when combined with KG-Prover, with consistent improvements ranging from 2-11\% on the ProofNet, miniF2F-test, and MUSTARD datasets without additional scaling. Furthermore, KG-Prover with o4-mini achieves over 50% miniF2F-test. This work provides a promising approach for augmenting natural language proof reasoning with knowledge graphs without the need for additional finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML AI4Math Workshop 2025, NAACL SRW 2025</p></details> |

Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks: ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and \emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively.

However, this training paradigm cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining. Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can One Domain Help Others? A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 24 figures |
| **[MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17476v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 (Survey Track)</p></details> |

A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks.

To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty. Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes. We construct an affine calculus for $1$-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers. We illustrate the expressivity of the logic by a sequence of case studies: Proving upper limits on bisimilarity distances of Markov processes, showing convergence of a temporal learning algorithm and of a random walk using a coupling argument. Finally we show how to encode a probabilistic Hoare logic in our logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages plus 30 pages proof appendix.

We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \textit{outperform} previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on their reasoning capability. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models - C32B, S32B, R32B - from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the current practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/JamyDon/Format-Beats-Descriptions.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.</p></details> |  |

While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02256v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies. Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization (UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of automated reward design compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |

Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically, we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Str...</summary><p>A Strong Baseline for Reasoning based Event Stream Scene Text Recognition</p></details> |

Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.</p></details> |  |

We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.

However, their reliance on probabilistic inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor, enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy, interpretable AI agents across complex domains.</p></details> |  |

Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2024</p></details> |

However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability, and directional conditional entropy. We analyze the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image. During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that, although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance on general vision tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> | 29 pages |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments.

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

Recent methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14% less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics, we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by better representing them in their logical formulations.</p></details> |  |

However, current image tokenization methods demonstrate significant limitations in tasks requiring symbolic abstraction and logical reasoning capabilities essential for systematic inference. To address this challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{https://github.com/zhangpingrui/Adaptive-Text-Dreamer}{here}.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Implies B: Circuit Analysis in LLMs for Propositional Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04105v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the size and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), it has proven challenging to uncover the underlying mechanisms that models use to solve reasoning problems. For instance, is their reasoning for a specific problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses. Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a foundation for a comprehensive benchmark framework to evaluate the performance of leading LLMs in executing spreadsheet functions, formula generation and data manipulation tasks. The benchmark encompasses tasks ranging from basic formula creation to complex, real world spreadsheet scenarios. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit proficiency in straightforward tasks, they often falter in complex, multi step operations, frequently producing plausible yet incorrect outputs. These results underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling spreadsheet tasks that require precise logical reasoning and highlight the need for integrating symbolic reasoning capabilities into LLM architectures. To support this, we introduce FLARE (Formula Logic, Auditing, Reasoning and Evaluation) a new benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on real-world spreadsheet logic, auditing, and reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 10 Tables, 1 Colour Figure</p></details> |

Can open-source, smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers -- a simple recipe that leverages the collective intelligence of these smaller models. The Avengers builds upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response with repeated sampling. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers surpasses GPT-4o, 4.1, and 4.5 in average performance across 15 diverse datasets spanning mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, general knowledge, and affective tasks. In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter -- the number of clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, supplementary material (appendix) included separately</p></details> |
| **[ProtoReasoning: Prototypes as the Foundation for Generalizable Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15211v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.</p></details> |  |

As a comprehensive multimodal Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, AIGGC imposes substantial demands on language models, including factual accuracy, logical reasoning, expressive text generation, generation speed, and context management. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for AIGGC and present a comprehensive survey of 45 existing game commentary dataset and methods according to key challenges they aim to address in this domain. We further classify and compare various evaluation metrics commonly used in this domain.

Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Breaking Thought Patterns: A Multi-Dimensional Reasoning Framework for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13192v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses. To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion-R1: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Human Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10353v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in language models.

Recent advances in general vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning, consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines, showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and R1-like training paradigms.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Scaling up Intervention Models</p></details> |

However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.</p></details> | 6 pages |
