| **[Mode Switching-based STAR-RIS with Discrete Phase Shifters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17613v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for cost-effective, high-speed Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the coming sixth-generation (6G) networks has driven research toward maximizing spectral efficiency and simplifying hardware designs. In this context, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem for a mode-switching discrete-phase shifters simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided multi-antenna access point network, emphasizing hardware efficiency and reduced cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear optimization framework is formulated for joint optimization of the active beamforming matrix, user power allocation, and STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, including binary transmission/reflection amplitudes and discrete phase shifters. To solve the formulated problem, we employ a block coordinate descent method, dividing it into three subproblems tackled using difference-of-concave programming and combinatorial optimization techniques. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization approach, consistently achieving superior sum rate performance compared to partial optimization methods, thereby underscoring its potential for efficient and scalable 6G IoT systems.</p></details> | accepted by IEEE WCL |
| **[Hephaestus: Mixture Generative Modeling with Energy Guidance for Large-scale QoS Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17036v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions. This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 19 figures, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Improved Approximation Algorithms for Low-Rank Problems Using Semidefinite Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02942v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the impact of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on combinatorial optimization, we construct an analogous relax-then-round strategy for low-rank optimization problems. First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme that obtains provably near-optimal solutions, building on the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. For a given $n \times m$ semi-orthogonal matrix, we derive a purely multiplicative approximation ratio for our algorithm, and show that it is never worse than $\max(2/(\pi m), 1/(\pi(\log (2m)+1)))$. We also show how to compute a tighter constant for a finite $(n,m)$ by solving a univariate optimization problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Overh...</summary><p>Overhauled approximation algorithm in orthogonally constrained case; now guarantee is purely multiplicative and logarithmic in number of columns</p></details> |
| **[LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank, factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Computing Communications for Multi-User Virtual Reality in Distributed Mobile Edge Computing Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14243v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications impose stringent requirements on latency, energy efficiency, and computational resources, particularly in multi-user interactive scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13883v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For combinatorial optimization problems, model-based paradigms such as mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) aim to decouple modeling and solving a problem: the `holy grail' of declarative problem solving. We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Data-intrinsic approximation in metric spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13496v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysis and processing of data is a vital part of our modern society and requires vast amounts of computational resources. To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Comparison of Gate-Based and Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Power Flow Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13378v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the first direct comparison between gate-based quantum computing (GQC) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) for solving the AC power flow (PF) equations. Building on the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) algorithm originally designed for annealing platforms, we adapt it to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The PF equations are reformulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Numerical experiments on a 4-bus test system assess solution accuracy and computational time. Results from QAOA are benchmarked against those obtained using D-Wave's Advantage system and Fujitsu's latest generation Digital Annealer, i.e., Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The findings provide quantitative insights into the performance trade-offs, scalability, and practical viability of GQC versus AQC paradigms for PF analysis, highlighting the potential of quantum algorithms to address the computational challenges associated with modern electricity networks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ).</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, submitted to PSCC 2026</p></details> |
| **[High-Parallel FPGA-Based Discrete Simulated Bifurcation for Large-Scale Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12407v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity, making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Action Self-Improvement for Neural Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12273v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and the ability to learn coordinated behavior. We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries, we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared to standard self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thin Trees via $k$-Respecting Cut Identities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12050v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thin spanning trees lie at the intersection of graph theory, approximation algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. They are central to the long-standing \emph{thin tree conjecture}, which asks whether every $k$-edge-connected graph contains an $O(1/k)$-thin tree, and they underpin algorithmic breakthroughs such as the $O(\log n/\log\log n)$-approximation for ATSP. Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \emph{verifying} that a given tree is thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about exponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known. We introduce a new machinery of \emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which express the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$ edges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a tree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in $O_k(1)$ time. Building on this oracle, we give the first procedure to compute the exact $k$-thinness certificate $\Theta_k(T)$ of any spanning tree for fixed $k$ in time $\tilde O(n^2+n^k)$, outputting both the certificate value and a witnessing cut. Beyond general graphs, our framework yields sharper guarantees in structured settings. In planar graphs, duality with cycles and dual girth imply that every spanning tree admits a verifiable certificate $\Theta_k(T)\le k/\lambda$ (hence $O(1/\lambda)$ for constant $k$). In graphs embedded on a surface of genus $\gamma$, refined counting gives certified (per-cut) bounds $O((\log n+\gamma)/\lambda)$ via the same ensemble coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typos found by: Yiming Zhang, Chenbo Xi, and Timothy Chan</p></details> |
| **[Hot-Starting Quantum Portfolio Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11153v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization with a smooth and convex objective function arises naturally in applications such as discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization, where assets must be traded in integer quantities. Although optimal solutions to the associated smooth problem can be computed efficiently, existing adiabatic quantum optimization methods cannot leverage this information. Moreover, while various warm-starting strategies have been proposed for gate-based quantum optimization, none of them explicitly integrate insights from the relaxed continuous solution into the QUBO formulation. In this work, a novel approach is introduced that restricts the search space to discrete solutions in the vicinity of the continuous optimum by constructing a compact Hilbert space, thereby reducing the number of required qubits. Experiments on software solvers and a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17200v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent line of structured learning methods has advanced the practical state-of-the-art for combinatorial optimization problems with complex, application-specific objectives. These approaches learn policies that couple a statistical model with a tractable surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle, so as to exploit the distribution of problem instances instead of solving each instance independently. A core obstacle is that the empirical risk is then piecewise constant in the model parameters. This hinders gradient-based optimization and only few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. We address this issue by analyzing smoothed (perturbed) policies: adding controlled random perturbations to the direction used by the linear oracle yields a differentiable surrogate risk and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that decomposes the excess risk into perturbation bias, statistical estimation error, and optimization error. The analysis hinges on a new Uniform Weak (UW) property capturing the geometric interaction between the statistical model and the normal fan of the feasible polytope; we show it holds under mild assumptions, and automatically when a minimal baseline perturbation is present. The framework covers, in particular, contextual stochastic optimization. We illustrate the scope of the results on applications such as stochastic vehicle scheduling, highlighting how smoothing enables both tractable training and controlled generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main document, 3 pages supplement.

| **[Graph-SCP: Accelerating Set Cover Problems with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07979v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used to accelerate combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Denoising Diffusion-Based Evolutionary Algorithm Framework: Application to the Maximum Independent Set Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08627v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a promising generative approach for combinatorial optimization, yet they often lack the robust exploration capabilities of traditional metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs). We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO, a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, code available in https://github.com/jsalvasoler/difusco_ddea</p></details> |
| **[Lagrange Oscillatory Neural Networks for Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07179v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-inspired computing paradigms are receiving renewed attention to enhance efficiency in compute-intensive tasks such as artificial intelligence and optimization. Similar to Hopfield neural networks, oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) minimize an Ising energy function that embeds the solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite their success in solving unconstrained optimization problems, Ising machines still face challenges with constrained problems as they can become trapped in infeasible local minima. In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange ONN (LagONN) designed to escape infeasible states based on the theory of Lagrange multipliers. Unlike existing oscillatory Ising machines, LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to guide the system towards feasible states in an augmented energy landscape, settling only when constraints are met. Taking the maximum satisfiability problem with three literals as a use case (Max-3-SAT), we harness LagONN's constraint satisfaction mechanism to find optimal solutions for random SATlib instances with up to 200 variables and 860 clauses, which provides a deterministic alternative to simulated annealing for coupled oscillators. We benchmark LagONN with SAT solvers and further discuss the potential of Lagrange oscillators to address other constraints, such as phase copying, which is useful in oscillatory Ising machines with limited connectivity.</p></details> |  |

The framework consists of three sequential stages: broad exploration of the parameter space, exploitation of top-performing parameters, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess the reliability of results. As a case study, we apply ACO to the TSPLIB berlin52 dataset, which has a known optimal tour length of 7542. Using our framework, we calculate that the probability of ACO finding the global optimum is approximately 1/40 in a single run and improves to 1/5 when aggregated over ten runs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHARME: A chain-based reinforcement learning approach for the minor embedding problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07124v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) has great potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolyNet: Learning Diverse Solution Strategies for Neural Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14048v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based methods for constructing solutions to combinatorial optimization problems are rapidly approaching the performance of human-designed algorithms. To further narrow the gap, learning-based approaches must efficiently explore the solution space during the search process. Recent approaches artificially increase exploration by enforcing diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules, however, these rules can impair solution quality and are difficult to design for more complex problems. In this paper, we introduce PolyNet, an approach for improving exploration of the solution space by learning complementary solution strategies. In contrast to other works, PolyNet uses only a single-decoder and a training schema that does not enforce diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules. We evaluate PolyNet on four combinatorial optimization problems and observe that the implicit diversity mechanism allows PolyNet to find better solutions than approaches that explicitly enforce diverse solution generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Streaming Max-Cut in General Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04435v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Max-Cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that has been studied in various computational settings. In this work, we initiate the study of its streaming complexity in general metric spaces with access to distance oracles. We give a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for estimating the Max-Cut value sliding-window streams using only poly-logarithmic space. This is the first sliding-window algorithm for Max-Cut even in Euclidean spaces, and it achieves a similar error-space tradeoff as the state-of-the-art insertion-only algorithms in Euclidean settings [Chen, Jiang, Krauthgamer, STOC'23], but without relying on Euclidean structures. In sharp contrast, we prove a polynomial-space lower bound for any $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-approximation in the dynamic streaming setting. This yields a separation from the Euclidean case, where the polylogarithmic-space $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation extends to dynamic streams. On the technical side, our sliding-window algorithm builds on the smooth histogram framework of [Braverman and Ostrovsky, SICOMP'10]. To make this framework applicable, we establish the first smoothness bound for metric Max-Cut. Moreover, we develop a streaming algorithm for metric Max-Cut in insertion-only streams, whose key ingredient is a new metric reservoir sampling technique.</p></details> |  |

CVRP plays an essential position in logistics systems, and it is the most intensively studied problem in combinatorial optimization. In complexity, CVRP with k $\ge$ 3 is an NP-hard problem, and it is APX-hard as well. We already knew that it could not be approximated in metric space. Moreover, it is the first problem resisting Arora's famous approximation framework. So, whether there is, a polynomial-time (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation for the Euclidean CVRP for any $\epsilon>0$ is still an open problem. This paper will summarize the research progress from history to up-to-date developments. The survey will be updated periodically.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[MG2FlowNet: Accelerating High-Reward Sample Generation via Enhanced MCTS and Greediness Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00805v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution.

We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 tab...</summary><p>1 table, 6 figures. 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Accepted for the Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |
| **[Short circuit walks in fixed dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01916v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit augmentation schemes are a family of combinatorial algorithms for linear programming that generalize the simplex method. To solve the linear program, they construct a so-called monotone circuit walk: They start at an initial vertex of the feasible region and traverse a discrete sequence of points on the boundary, while moving along certain allowed directions (circuits) and improving the objective function at each step until reaching an optimum. Since the existence of short circuit walks has been conjectured (Circuit Diameter Conjecture), several works have investigated how well one can efficiently approximate shortest monotone circuit walks towards an optimum. A first result addressing this question was given by De Loera, Kafer, and Sanit\`a [SIAM J. Opt., 2022], who showed that given as input an LP and the starting vertex, finding a $2$-approximation for this problem is NP-hard. Cardinal and the third author [Math. Prog. 2023] gave a stronger lower bound assuming the exponential time hypothesis, showing that even an approximation factor of $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ is intractable for LPs defined by $m$ inequalities. Both of these results were based on reductions from highly degenerate polytopes in combinatorial optimization with high dimension. In this paper, we significantly strengthen the aforementioned hardness results by showing that for every fixed $\varepsilon>0$ approximating the problem on polygons with $m$ edges to within a factor of $O(m^{1-\varepsilon})$ is NP-hard. This result is essentially best-possible, as it cannot be improved beyond $o(m)$. In particular, this implies hardness for simple polytopes and in fixed dimension.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization with Order-Invariant Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01824v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs, which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies, improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Configuration Allocation in Pre-Production Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05147v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments. Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.</p></details> |  |

The resulting circuit is composed of a polynomial number of Pauli rotations without ancilla qubit. Extending this result, we prove that for sufficiently large qubit number, any quantum state can be approximately prepared with a constant (polynomial) number of Pauli rotations to constant (inverse-polynomial) precision. Our theoretical findings reveal exponential quantum advantages in the prominent applications: ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lower Bound for the Max Entropy Algorithm for TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01950v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most famous conjectures in combinatorial optimization is the four-thirds conjecture, which states that the integrality gap of the subtour LP relaxation of the TSP is equal to $\frac43$. For 40 years, the best known upper bound was 1.5, due to Wolsey (1980). Recently, Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan (2022) showed that the max entropy algorithm for the TSP gives an improved bound of $1.5 - 10^{-36}$. In this paper, we show that the approximation ratio of the max entropy algorithm is at least 1.375, even for graphic TSP. Thus the max entropy algorithm does not appear to be the algorithm that will ultimately resolve the four-thirds conjecture in the affirmative, should that be possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Census Data Generation via Multidimensional Multiset Sum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The US Decennial Census provides valuable data for both research and policy purposes. Census data are subject to a variety of disclosure avoidance techniques prior to release in order to preserve respondent confidentiality. While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by a critical lack of data: The underlying "microdata," which serve as necessary input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting. While the problem we study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance. Finally, we verify that the data we produce are "close" to the desired ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to enhance their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal and is under review</p></details> |
| **[Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompts and Heuristics for Automatic Algorithm Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24509v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, an increasing number of learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning with Local Search MCMC Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14240v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metric Representations of Network Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00164v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks are structures that encode relationships between pairs of elements or nodes. However, there is no imposed connection between these relationships, i.e., the relationship between two nodes can be independent of every other one in the network, and need not be defined for every possible pair of nodes. This is not true for metric spaces, where the triangle inequality imposes conditions that must be satisfied by triads of distances in the space, and these distances must be defined for every pair of nodes. In this paper, we study how to project networks into q-metric spaces, a generalization of metric spaces that encompasses a larger class of structured representations. In order to do this, we encode as axioms two intuitively desirable properties of the mentioned projections. We show that there is only one way of projecting networks onto q-metric spaces satisfying these axioms. Moreover, for the special case of (regular) metric spaces, this method boils down to computing the shortest path between every node and, for the case of ultrametric spaces, it coincides with single linkage hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we show that the projection method satisfies two properties of practical relevance: optimality, which enables its utilization for the efficient estimation of combinatorial optimization problems, and nestedness, which entails consistency of the structure induced when projecting onto different q-metric spaces. Finally, we illustrate how metric projections can be used to efficiently search networks aided by metric trees.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[A Near-Real-Time Reduction-Based Algorithm for Coloring Massive Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23606v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph coloring problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem with important applications such as register allocation and task scheduling, and it has been extensively studied for decades. However, near-real-time algorithms that can deliver high-quality solutions for very large real-world graphs within a strict time frame remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by systematically investigating reduction rules that shrink the problem size while preserving optimality. For the first time, domination reduction, complement crown reduction, and independent set reduction are applied to large-scale instances. Building on these techniques, we propose RECOL, a reduction-based algorithm that alternates between fast estimation of lower and upper bounds, graph reductions, and heuristic coloring. We evaluate RECOL on a wide range of benchmark datasets, including SNAP, the Network Repository, DIMACS10, and DIMACS2. Experimental results show that RECOL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on very large sparse graphs within one minute. Additional experiments further highlight the pivotal role of reduction techniques in achieving this performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTSP: A Vision Language Models Guided Framework for Large-Scale Traveling Salesman Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23465v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling, and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration. While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for integration into more complex logistics systems.

| **[AutoEP: LLMs-Driven Automation of Hyperparameter Evolution for Metaheuristic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23189v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation, they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design.

| **[IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SB, C...</summary><p>SB, CD, SC, KL are equally contributing authors</p></details> |

By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations.

Our method offers concrete evidence that neural networks can directly capture and exploit combinatorial structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing for Minimum Bisection Problem: A Machine Learning-based Approach for Penalty Parameter Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19005v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Minimum Bisection Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, with practical applications in areas such as parallel computing, network design, and machine learning. In this paper, we examine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to solve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation lies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the problem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter. Specifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict suitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input graph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the penalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem instance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of minimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions. We test our approach on a large dataset of randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with up to 4,000 nodes, and we compare the results with classical partitioning algorithms, Metis and Kernighan-Lin. Experimental findings demonstrate that our adaptive tuning strategy significantly improves the performance of the quantum annealing hybrid solver and consistently outperforms the classical methods used, indicating its potential as an alternative for the graph partitioning problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Network Slice Placement with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18545v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities, with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within 7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network slice placement in heterogeneous infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Coordination for Evolving Multi-agent Systems: A Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18088v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06253v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: f...</summary><p>v2: fixed spelling Bhattacharya->Bhattacharyya on title page</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as End-to-end Combinatorial Optimization Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16865v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to decision-making scenarios like logistics and manufacturing, are traditionally solved using problem-specific algorithms requiring significant domain expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating CO problem solving, existing approaches rely on intermediate steps such as code generation or solver invocation, limiting their generality and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that empowers LLMs to serve as end-to-end CO solvers by directly mapping natural language problem descriptions to solutions. We propose a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) imparts LLMs with solution generation patterns from domain-specific solvers, while a feasibility-and-optimality-aware reinforcement learning (FOARL) process explicitly mitigates constraint violations and refines solution quality. Evaluation across seven NP-hard CO problems shows that our method achieves a high feasibility rate and reduces the average optimality gap to 1.03-8.20% by tuning a 7B-parameter LLM, surpassing both general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and domain-specific heuristics. Our method establishes a unified language-based pipeline for CO without extensive code execution or manual architectural adjustments for different problems, offering a general and language-driven alternative to traditional solver design while maintaining relative feasibility guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06126v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. In many applications, one has to repeatedly solve VRP instances drawn from the same distribution, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce an optimization framework where a reinforcement learning agent is trained on prior instances and quickly generates initial solutions, which are then further optimized by a genetic algorithm. This framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time budgets. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within one second, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling real-time and interactive routing at scale. EARLI can generalize to new data, as we demonstrate on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. By combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, our hybrid framework takes a step forward to closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem. In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variables Ordering Optimization in Boolean Characteristic Set Method Using Simulated Annealing and Machine Learning-based Time Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14754v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving systems of Boolean equations is a fundamental task in symbolic computation and algebraic cryptanalysis, with wide-ranging applications in cryptography, coding theory, and formal verification. Among existing approaches, the Boolean Characteristic Set (BCS) method[1] has emerged as one of the most efficient algorithms for tackling such problems. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the ordering of variables, with solving times varying drastically under different orderings for fixed variable counts n and equations size m. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel optimization framework that synergistically integrates machine learning (ML)-based time prediction with simulated annealing (SA) to efficiently identify high-performance variables orderings. Weconstruct a dataset comprising variable frequency spectrum X and corresponding BCS solving time t for benchmark systems(e.g., n = m = 28). Utilizing this data, we train an accurate ML predictor ft(X) to estimate solving time for any given variables ordering. For each target system, ft serves as the cost function within an SA algorithm, enabling rapid discovery of low-latency orderings that significantly expedite subsequent BCS execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms the standard BCS algorithm[1], Gr\"obner basis method [2] and SAT solver[3], particularly for larger-scale systems(e.g., n = 32). Furthermore, we derive probabilistic time complexity bounds for the overall algorithm using stochastic process theory, establishing a quantitative relationship between predictor accuracy and expected solving complexity. This work provides both a practical acceleration tool for algebraic cryptanalysis and a theoretical foundation for ML-enhanced combinatorial optimization in symbolic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00364v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in quantum computing have spurred substantial research into the application of quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) emerges as a classic and critical paradigm in the field. For a graph G(V, E), TDP entails finding a minimal subset D subset of V that contains no isolated vertices, where every vertex not in D has at least one neighbor in D. TDP finds extensive applications across domains such as computer networks, social networks, and communications. Since the latter half of the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing solution algorithms, which have become foundational to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to TDP remains largely underexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse set of parameters. This paper proves that the upper bound on the number of qubits required to solve TDP is 2|V| + |V| log_2( (2|E|)/|V| - 1 ). Our experimental findings demonstrate that QAOA is effective in addressing TDP: under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes a valid total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for solving TDP and lays a solid groundwork for future investigations in this area.</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.</p></details> | 36 pages, 20 figures |

Traditional constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability. While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated \textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We wish to withdraw this manuscript as we have identified several technical details that require further optimization and refinement.

However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models in Many-to-One Matching Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13131v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Location and allocation problem of high-speed train maintenance bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13383v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintenance bases are crucial for the safe and stable operation of high-speed trains, necessitating significant financial investment for their construction and operation. Planning the location and task allocation of these bases in the vast high-speed railway network is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This paper explored the strategic planning of identifying optimal locations for maintenance bases, introducing a bi-level programming model. The upper-level objective was to minimize the annualized total cost, including investment for new or expanding bases and total maintenance costs, while the lower-level focused on dispatching high-speed trains to the most suitable base for maintenance tasks, thereby reducing maintenance operation dispatch costs under various investment scenarios. A case study of the Northwest China high-speed rail network demonstrated the application of this model, and included the sensitivity analysis reflecting maintenance policy reforms. The results showed that establishing a new base in Hami and expanding Xi'an base could minimize the total annualized cost during the planning period, amounting to a total of 2,278.15 million RMB. This paper offers an optimization method for selecting maintenance base locations that ensures reliability and efficiency in maintenance work as the number of trains increases in the future.</p></details> |  |

We intend to (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of theoretical knowledge on the B\&B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms typically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we show that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack and scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly better solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by computational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods. This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at ICALP 2025</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the understudied subject of how, in practice, such formulas can be learned by deep neural networks. Specifically, we analyze boolean formulas associated with model-sampling benchmarks, combinatorial optimization problems, and random 3-CNFs with varying degrees of constrainedness. Our experiments indicate that: (i) neural learning generalizes better than pure rule-based systems and pure symbolic approach; (ii) relatively small and shallow neural networks are very good approximators of formulas associated with combinatorial optimization problems; (iii) smaller formulas seem harder to learn, possibly due to the fewer positive (satisfying) examples available; and (iv) interestingly, underconstrained 3-CNF formulas are more challenging to learn than overconstrained ones. Such findings pave the way for a better understanding, construction, and use of interpretable neurosymbolic AI methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted for NeSy 2025</p></details> |

Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed. In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers. Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</p></details> |  |

The model targets combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order and addresses fundamental limitations of previous OIM models through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance.

However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn for substantial modifications in the method and the experiment</p></details> |

In recent years, many online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20 training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority dispatching rules.</p></details> |  |

However, existing algorithms such as Reversible Recombination (RevReCom) and Metropolized Forest Recombination (MFR) are constrained to sampling from distributions related to spanning trees. We introduce the marked edge walk (MEW), a novel MCMC algorithm for sampling from the space of graph partitions under a tunable distribution. The walk operates on the space of spanning trees with marked edges, allowing for calculable transition probabilities for use in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Empirical results on real-world dual graphs show convergence under target distributions unrelated to spanning trees. For this reason, MEW represents an advancement in flexible ensemble generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: A Continuous Functional Framework from Navier-Stokes Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14409v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for dynamic spatial treatment effect boundaries using continuous functional definitions grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment effect estimators, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as a continuous function $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of propagation dynamics, boundary evolution, and cumulative exposure patterns. Building on exact self-similar solutions expressible through Kummer confluent hypergeometric and modified Bessel functions, I establish that treatment effects follow scaling laws $\tau(d, t) = t^{-\alpha} f(d/t^\beta)$ where exponents characterize diffusion mechanisms. Empirical validation using 42 million TROPOMI satellite observations of NO$_2$ pollution from U.S. coal-fired power plants demonstrates strong exponential spatial decay ($\kappa_s = 0.004$ per km, $R^2 = 0.35$) with detectable boundaries at 572 km. Monte Carlo simulations confirm superior performance over discrete parametric methods in boundary detection and false positive avoidance (94\% vs 27\% correct rejection). Regional heterogeneity analysis validates diagnostic capability: positive decay parameters within 100 km confirm coal plant dominance; negative parameters beyond 100 km correctly signal when urban sources dominate. The continuous functional perspective unifies spatial econometrics with mathematical physics, providing theoretically grounded methods for boundary detection, exposure quantification, and policy evaluation across environmental economics, banking, and healthcare applications.</p></details> | 79 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Nonparametric Identification of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from Bank Branch Consolidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13148v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I develop a nonparametric framework for identifying spatial boundaries of treatment effects without imposing parametric functional form restrictions. The method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020, matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209 census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates, consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom. This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Orbital Parameters of Direct Imaging Exoplanet Using Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17459v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework, our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</p></details> |  |

However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Robust Semiparametric Inference for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24634v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a semiparametric framework for inference on the mean response in missing-data settings using a corrected posterior distribution. Our approach is tailored to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), which is a powerful predictive method but whose nonsmoothness complicate asymptotic theory with multi-dimensional covariates. When using BART combined with Bayesian bootstrap weights, we establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem and show that the limit distribution generally contains a bias term. To address this, we introduce RoBART, a posterior bias-correction that robustifies BART for valid inference on the mean response. Monte Carlo studies support our theory, demonstrating reduced bias and improved coverage relative to existing procedures using BART.</p></details> |  |

While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

| **[A Hybrid Two-level MCMC Framework to Accelerate Posterior Mean Estimation with Deep Learning Surrogates for Bayesian Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01463v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems arise in various scientific and engineering domains, and solving them can be computationally demanding. This is especially the case for problems governed by partial differential equations, where the repeated evaluation of the forward operator is extremely expensive. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL)-based surrogate models have shown promising potential to accelerate the solution of such problems. However, despite their ability to learn from complex data, DL-based surrogate models generally cannot match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical models, which limits their practical applicability. We propose a novel hybrid two-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that combines the strengths of DL-based surrogate models and high-fidelity numerical solvers to {compute the posterior mean of Quantities of Interest (QoI) in} Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. The intuition is to leverage the evaluation speed of a DL-based surrogate model as the base chain, and correct its errors using a limited number of high-fidelity numerical model evaluations in a correction chain; hence its name hybrid two-level MCMC method. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a pure numerical MCMC method while requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost. The theoretical analysis is further supported by several numerical experiments, namely a Poisson, a non-linear reaction-diffusion, and a Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed hybrid framework can be generalized to other approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter and sequential Monte Carlo methods.</p></details> |  |

We derive statistical properties of the sample estimator and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, such as asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and a finite-sample deviation bound that matches the Monte Carlo rate up to regularization. Building on these findings, we introduce a joint Wald-type statistic to test for shape constraints over finite grids. The approach comes with an efficient computational procedure based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization, facilitating scalability to large datasets. Empirical tests suggest favorably of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 1 figure |

These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 pages; updated main text and Supp. Mat</p></details> |
| **[Robust Optimization with Diffusion Models for Green Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05730v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | UAI 2025 |
| **[Enhanced Lepage-type test statistics for location-scale shifts with right-skewed data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19126v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting simultaneous shifts in location and scale between two populations is a common challenge in statistical inference, particularly in fields like biomedicine where right-skewed data distributions are prevalent. The classical Lepage test, which combines the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Ansari-Bradley tests, can be suboptimal under these conditions due to its restrictive assumptions of equal variances and medians. This study systematically evaluates enhanced Lepage-type test statistics that incorporate modern robust components for improved performance with right-skewed data. We combine the Fligner-Policello test and Fong-Huang variance estimator for the location component with a novel empirical variance estimator for the Ansari-Bradley scale component, relaxing assumptions of equal variances and medians. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across exponential, gamma, chi-square, lognormal, and Weibull distributions demonstrate that tests incorporating both robust components achieve power improvements of 10-25\% over the classical Lepage test while maintaining reasonable Type I error control. The practical utility is demonstrated through analyses of four real-world biomedical datasets, where the tests successfully detect significant location-scale shifts. We provide practical guidance for test selection and discuss implementation considerations, making these methods accessible for practitioners in biomedical research and other disciplines where right-skewed data are common.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating location parameters of several exponential distributions with ordered restriction under Linex loss function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16527v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some improved estimators of the location parameters of several exponential distributions with ordered restriction are derived and compared numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Note that the two-parameter exponential distribution is very useful in different areas like survival analysis, reliability engineering and biomedical research, where products have a guaranteed failure-free operating time before failures begin to occur. In the present manuscript, we address the component-wise estimation of location parameters of $k~(\ge 2)$ exponential distributions under an asymmetric Linex loss function. The location parameter represents a minimum guaranteed period before failure. At first, we consider the estimation of the location parameters with ordered scale parameters. Next, we address the estimation of ordered location parameters. For this, we take three different cases into account as follows: $(i)$ scale parameters are known, $(ii)$ scale parameters are unknown but equal, $(iii)$ scale parameters are unknown and unequal. In these cases, we establish general inadmissibility results. Further, using the general result, the inadmissibility of the best affine equivariant estimator is proved. The improved estimators are written in explicit forms. Additionally, we show that the results for several important life-testing schemes namely $(i)$ Type-II censoring, $(ii)$ progressive type-II censoring and $(iii)$ record value data can be obtained using i.i.d sample.Finally, for each case, the Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to compare the performance of the proposed estimators based on their risk values. The numerical results reveal a significant improvement of the proposed estimators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Scalar-on-Function Quantile Regression Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16429v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel spatial scalar-on-function quantile regression model that extends classical scalar-on-function models to account for spatial dependence and heterogeneous conditional distributions. The proposed model incorporates spatial autocorrelation through a spatially lagged response and characterizes the entire conditional distribution of a scalar outcome given a functional predictor. To address the endogeneity induced by the spatial lag term, we develop two robust estimation procedures based on instrumental variable strategies. $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established under mild regularity conditions. We demonstrate through extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed estimators outperform existing mean-based and robust alternatives, particularly in settings with strong spatial dependence and outlier contamination. We apply our method to high-resolution environmental data from the Lombardy region in Italy, using daily ozone trajectories to predict daily mean particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers concentrations. The empirical results confirm the superiority of our approach in predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across various quantile levels. Our method has been implemented in the \texttt{ssofqrm} R package.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation. Code is available at: https://github.com/vinhsuhi/Orbit-Diffusion.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[A hierarchical Bayesian approach for population-based structural health monitoring in ship hull structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16316v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural health monitoring (SHM) strategies involve the processing of structural response data to indirectly assess an asset's condition. These strategies can be enhanced for a group of structures, especially when they are similar, since mutual underlying physics are expected to exist. The concept behind population-based SHM exploits the sharing of data among individuals, so that data-rich members can support data-scarce ones. One approach to population-level modeling is the hierarchical Bayesian method, where the model is structured hierarchically in terms of its parameters, and correlation among learning tasks is enabled by conditioning on shared latent variables. This work investigates the application of a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer expected distributions of deflection amplitudes at both the population and domain levels, with the aim of detecting excessive initial deflections in a population of plate elements. Although these damages are typically localized, they can trigger unexpected events, if not properly monitored. The work is conducted in a numerical setting using a Finite Element model to generate strain response data, which serve as the monitoring data. Bayesian inference was conducted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with a surrogate model employed to calculate the likelihood function. The hierarchical approach was compared to an independent model for a plate component with few data. The results revealed that, under data sparsity conditions, the hierarchical model can offer more robust results in terms of uncertainty, which is essential for decision-making tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures.

| **[A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |

To alleviate this burden, we propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm, which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing. Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for ultrasound image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty estimation methods in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and results available at https://github.com/Saumya4321/mc-dropout-boundary-correlation</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Multi-Path Plan Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11620v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model (LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

For the state-of-the-art minimax exponential tilting (MET) method, we show that the complexity of each of its components can be greatly reduced through an integrand parameterization that utilizes the sparse inverse Cholesky factor produced by the Vecchia approximation, whose approximation error is often negligible relative to the Monte-Carlo error. Based on this idea, we derive algorithms that can estimate MVN probabilities and sample from truncated MVN distributions in linear time (and that are easily parallelizable) at the same convergence or acceptance rate as MET, whose complexity is cubic in the dimension of the MVN probability. We showcase the advantages of our methods relative to existing approaches using several simulated examples. We also analyze a groundwater-contamination dataset with over twenty thousand censored measurements to demonstrate the scalability of our method for partially censored Gaussian-process models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroundedPRM: Tree-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Process Reward Modeling for Step-Level Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14942v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards, low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool, providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback. Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples, amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality process-level reasoning.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Traditional deterministic schedules break down when reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs. This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4 benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances.

| **[Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learned harmonic mean estimation of the Bayesian evidence with normalizing flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05969v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the learned harmonic mean estimator with normalizing flows - a robust, scalable and flexible estimator of the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics 14 pages, 8 figures, harmonic code available at https://github.com/astro-informatics/harmonic</p></details> |

To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the AMOS 2022 dataset obtains an average Dice of 85.09%, IoU of 76.66%, ASSD of 19.49 mm, and VOE of 23.34%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review in IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Active Measuring in Reinforcement Learning With Delayed Negative Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14315v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state. The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures.

Recently, they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a \emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution. We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling from these twisted distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantitative Analysis of UAV Intrusion Mitigation for Border Security in 5G with LEO Backhaul Impairments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14066v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pose emerging threats to critical infrastructure and border protection by operating as rogue user equipment (UE) within cellular networks, consuming resources, creating interference, and potentially violating restricted airspaces. This paper presents minimal features of the operating space, yet an end-to-end simulation framework to analyze detect-to-mitigate latency of such intrusions in a hybrid terrestrial-non-terrestrial (LEO satellite) 5G system. The system model includes terrestrial gNBs, satellite backhaul (with stochastic outages), and a detection logic (triggered by handover instability and signal quality variance). A lockdown mechanism is invoked upon detection, with optional local fallback to cap mitigation delays. Monte Carlo sweeps across UAV altitudes, speeds, and satellite outage rates yield several insights. First, satellite backhaul outages can cause arbitrarily long mitigation delays, yet, to meet fallback deadlines, they need to be effectively bounded. Second, while handover instability was hypothesized, our results show that extra handovers have a negligible effect within the range of parameters we considered. The main benefit of resilience from fallback comes from the delay in limiting mitigation. Third, patrol UEs experience negligible collateral impact, with handover rates close to terrestrial baselines. Stress scenarios further highlight that fallback is indispensable in preventing extreme control-plane and physical security vulnerabilities: Without fallback, prolonged outages in the satellite backhaul delay lockdown commands, allowing rogue UAVs to linger inside restricted corridors for several seconds longer. These results underscore the importance of complementing non-terrestrial links with local control to ensure robust and timely response against uncooperative UAV intrusions.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages content. 2 pages references</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Nested MLMC for Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation with Intractable Likelihoods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16776v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in studying sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques due to their advantages for simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. The methods aim to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. As an SNPE technique, the automatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al. (2019) performs well and scales to high-dimensional data. However, the APT method requires computing the expectation of the logarithm of an intractable normalizing constant, i.e., a nested expectation. Although atomic proposals were used to render an analytical normalizing constant, it remains challenging to analyze the convergence of learning. In this paper, we reformulate APT as a nested estimation problem. Building on this, we construct several multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators for the loss function and its gradients to accommodate different scenarios, including two unbiased estimators, and a biased estimator that trades a small bias for reduced variance and controlled runtime and memory usage. We also provide convergence results of stochastic gradient descent to quantify the interaction of the bias and variance of the gradient estimator. Numerical experiments for approximating complex posteriors with multimodality in moderate dimensions are provided to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Control variates for variance-reduced ratio of means estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13504v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control variates method is a classical variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo estimators that exploits correlated auxiliary variables without introducing bias. In many applications, the quantity of interest can be expressed as a ratio of expectations. We propose a variance-reduced estimator for such ratios, which applies control variates to both the numerator and the denominator. The control variate coefficients are optimized jointly to minimize the variance of the resulting estimator. This approach theoretically guarantees variance reduction and naturally extends to approximate control variates. Simulation studies show significant variance reduction, particularly when correlations between variables and control variates are strong. The practical value of the method is illustrated with a multi-fidelity aircraft design use case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-intrinsic approximation in metric spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13496v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysis and processing of data is a vital part of our modern society and requires vast amounts of computational resources. To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Using the Relative Importance Measures Based on Orthonormality Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13389v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A class of relative importance measures based on orthonormality transformation (OTMs), has been found to effectively approximate the General Dominance index (GD). In particular, Johnson's Relative Weight (RW) has been deemed the most successful OTM in the literature. Nevertheless, the theoretical foundation of the OTMs remains unclear. To further understand the OTMs, we provide a generalized framework that breaks down the OTM into two functional steps: orthogonalization and reallocation. To assess the impact of each step on the performance of OTMs, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations under various predictors' correlation structures and response variable distributions. Our findings reveal that Johnson's minimal transformation consistently outperforms other common orthogonalization methods. We also summarize the performance of reallocation methods under four scenarios of predictors' correlation structures in terms of the first principal component and the variance inflation factor (VIF). This analysis provides guidelines for selecting appropriate reallocation methods in different scenarios, illustrated with real-world dataset examples. Our research offers a deeper understanding of OTMs and provides valuable insights for practitioners seeking to accurately measure variable importance in various modeling contexts.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

We introduce the first general convergence diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo based on any f-divergence, allowing users to directly monitor, among others, the Kullback--Leibler and the $\chi^2$ divergences as well as the Hellinger and the total variation distances. Our first key contribution is a coupling-based `weight harmonization' scheme that produces a direct, computable, and consistent weighting of interacting Markov chains with respect to their target distribution. The second key contribution is to show how such consistent weightings of empirical measures can be used to provide upper bounds to f-divergences in general. We prove that these bounds are guaranteed to tighten over time and converge to zero as the chains approach stationarity, providing a concrete diagnostic. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is a practical and competitive diagnostic tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + 13 pages of appendix comprising mostly proofs. 8 figures.

| **[Scalable Bayesian inference for high-dimensional mixed-type multivariate spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13233v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial generalized linear mixed-effects methods are popularly used to model spatially indexed univariate responses. However, with modern technology, it is common to observe vector-valued mixed-type responses, e.g., a combination of binary, count, or continuous types, at each location. Methods that allow joint modeling of such mixed-type multivariate spatial responses are rare. Using latent multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs), we present a class of Bayesian spatial methods that can be employed for any combination of exponential family responses. Since multivariate GP-based methods can suffer from computational bottlenecks when the number of spatial locations is high, we further employ a computationally efficient Vecchia approximation for fast posterior inference and prediction. Key theoretical properties of the proposed model, such as identifiability and the structure of the induced covariance, are established. Our approach employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference method that utilizes elliptical slice sampling in a blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through simulation studies and a real-data application on joint modeling of wildfire counts and burnt areas across the United States.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we present a probabilistic guarantee for power flow learning and voltage risk estimation, derived through the framework of Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Specifically, we establish a bound on the expected estimation error that connects the GP's predictive variance to confidence in voltage risk estimates, ensuring statistical equivalence with Monte Carlo-based ACPF risk quantification. To enhance model learnability in the low-data regime, we first design the Vertex-Degree Kernel (VDK), a topology-aware additive kernel that decomposes voltage-load interactions into local neighborhoods for efficient large-scale learning. Building on this, we introduce a network-swipe active learning (AL) algorithm that adaptively samples informative operating points and provides a principled stopping criterion without requiring out-of-sample validation. Together, these developments mitigate the principal bottleneck of ML-based power flow-its lack of guaranteed reliability-by combining data efficiency with analytical assurance. Empirical evaluations across IEEE 118-, 500-, and 1354-bus systems confirm that the proposed VDK-GP achieves mean absolute voltage errors below 1E-03 p.u., reproduces Monte Carlo-level voltage risk estimates with 15x fewer ACPF computations, and achieves over 120x reduction in evaluation time while conservatively bounding violation probabilities.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13112v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics; yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN). We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and \emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins). Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings) affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).</p></details> |  |

| **[SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample-then-Filter in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Dikin-Langevin diffusion for polyhedra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04582v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interior-point geometry offers a straightforward approach to constrained sampling and optimization on polyhedra, eliminating reflections and ad hoc projections. We exploit the Dikin log-barrier to define a Dikin--Langevin diffusion whose drift and noise are modulated by the inverse barrier Hessian. In continuous time, we establish a boundary no-flux property; trajectories started in the interior remain in $U$ almost surely, so feasibility is maintained by construction. For computation, we adopt a discretize-then-correct design: an Euler--Maruyama proposal with state-dependent covariance, followed by a Metropolis--Hastings correction that targets the exact constrained law and reduces to a Dikin random walk when $f$ is constant. Numerically, the unadjusted diffusion exhibits the expected first-order step size bias, while the MH-adjusted variant delivers strong convergence diagnostics on anisotropic, box-constrained Gaussians (rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ concentrated near $1$) and higher inter-well transition counts on a bimodal target, indicating superior cross-well mobility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that coupling calibrated stochasticity with interior-point preconditioning provides a practical, reflection-free approach to sampling and optimization over polyhedral domains, offering clear advantages near faces, corners, and in nonconvex landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[EconProver: Towards More Economical Test-Time Scaling for Automated Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12603v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stochastic Entanglement Configuration for Constructive Entanglement Topologies in Quantum Machine Learning with Application to Cardiac MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11401v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CSC-MPPI: A Novel Constrained MPPI Framework with DBSCAN for Reliable Obstacle Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16386v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes Constrained Sampling Cluster Model Predictive Path Integral (CSC-MPPI), a novel constrained formulation of MPPI designed to enhance trajectory optimization while enforcing strict constraints on system states and control inputs. Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |

We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints.

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |

This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages coin betting ideas from convex optimisation, and the viewpoint of constrained sampling as a mirrored optimisation problem on the space of probability measures. Based on this viewpoint, we also introduce a unifying framework for several existing constrained sampling algorithms, including mirrored Langevin dynamics and mirrored Stein variational gradient descent. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on a range of numerical examples, including sampling from targets on the simplex, sampling with fairness constraints, and constrained sampling problems in post-selection inference. Our results indicate that our algorithms achieve competitive performance with existing constrained sampling methods, without the need to tune any hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

| **[Unbiased constrained sampling with Self-Concordant Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11925v3)** | 2023-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |

In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |

However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training.

For each problem, we propose a privacy preserving algorithm using stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques, and show that it can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. To the best of our knowledge, SSCA has not been used for solving federated optimization, and federated optimization with nonconvex constraints has not been investigated. Next, we customize the two proposed SSCA-based algorithms to two application examples, and provide closed-form solutions for the respective approximate convex problems at each iteration of SSCA. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate inherent advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed, communication cost and model specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICC 2021</p></details> |
| **[Projected Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling and Non-Convex Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12137v1)** | 2020-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Langevin algorithms are gradient descent methods with additive noise. They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

| **[Learning Equality Constraints for Motion Planning on Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11852v1)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |

How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

Conditional generators are one of the successful implementations of such models wherein the created samples are constrained to a specific class.

A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods.

Forced migration, including refugee and asylum seekers, plays an important role in overall migration patterns, but is notoriously difficult to forecast. Focusing on refugees and asylum seekers, we propose a modeling pipeline based on Bayesian hierarchical time-series modeling for projecting refugee population official statistics by country of origin using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Our approach is based on a conceptual model of refugee and asylum seeker populations following growth and decline phases, separated by a peak. The growth and decline phases are modeled by logistic growth and decline through an interrupted logistic process model. We evaluate our method through a set of validation exercises that show it has good performance for forecasts at 1, 5, and 10 year horizons, and we present projections for 35 countries of origin of large refugee and asylum seeker population.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

We aim to replicate and capture the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) to generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). This methodology offers potential advantages in process monitoring, modeling, forecasting, and optimization, enabling more efficient bioprocess management by reducing the dependence on scarce experimental data. Our results demonstrate acceptable performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of real bioprocess data. We focus on Optical Density, a key measurement for Dry Biomass estimation. The data generated showed high fidelity to the actual historical experimental data. This intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has opened new frontiers in data analysis and generation, particularly in computationally intensive fields, for use cases such as increasing prediction accuracy for soft sensor design or for use in predictive control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muscle Anatomy-aware Geometric Deep Learning for sEMG-based Gesture Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17660v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate decoding of gesture from non-invasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is important for various applications including spatial computing, healthcare, and entertainment, and has been actively pursued by researchers and industry. Majority of sEMG-based gesture decoding algorithms employ deep neural networks that are designed for Euclidean data, and may not be suitable for analyzing multi-dimensional, non-stationary time-series with long-range dependencies such as sEMG. State-of-the-art sEMG-based decoding methods also demonstrate high variability across subjects and sessions, requiring re-calibration and adaptive fine-tuning to boost performance. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a geometric deep learning model that learns on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and leverages unsupervised domain adaptation to desensitize the model to subjects and sessions. The model captures the features in time and across sensors with multiple kernels, projects the features onto SPD manifold, learns on manifolds and projects back to Euclidean space for classification. It uses a domain-specific batch normalization layer to address variability between sessions, alleviating the need for re-calibration or fine-tuning. Experiments with publicly available benchmark gesture decoding datasets (Ninapro DB6, Flexwear-HD) demonstrate the superior generalizability of the model compared to Euclidean and other SPD-based models in the inter-session scenario, with up to 8.83 and 4.63 points improvement in accuracy, respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that the model extracts muscle-specific information for different tasks and ablation studies highlight the importance of modules introduced in the work. The proposed method pushes the state-of-the-art in sEMG-based gesture recognition and opens new research avenues for manifold-based learning for muscle signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration.

Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37 widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter requirements.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Prediction of Battery Capacity Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17414v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |

Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges.

While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Deep Clustering for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20840v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings. This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.

| **[Unlocking the Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Task-Aware Time Series Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22279v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models.

| **[Trading with the Devil: Risk and Return in Foundation Model Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Driven Framework for Online Mitigation of False Data Injection Signals in Networked Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17155v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture. This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

This work demystifies the Transformer encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales, naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper presents a BlueSky vision built on two complementary directions. One builds robust foundations for time series reasoning, centered on comprehensive temporal understanding, structured multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks. The other advances system-level reasoning, moving beyond language-only explanations by incorporating multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, these directions outline a flexible and extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning, aiming to deliver interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Attention: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting for Environmental Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14050v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental crisis remains a global challenge that affects public health and environmental quality. Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting environmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction efficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series (MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental change. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model, MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines self-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically, MMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality indicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the time series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during the summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to perform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate that in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms iTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series prediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\% in MSE, 20\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\% in MAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate datasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\%, and there is an improvement compared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our ability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in diverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide valuable public health and environmental quality information, informing targeted interventions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Recently, Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis has become an important yet challenging task, attracting significant attention. While channel extremely matters to MTS tasks, channel-centric methods are still largely under-explored for MTS. Particularly, no previous work studied the effects of channel information of MTS in order to explore counterfactual effects between these channels and model performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Channel-wise Influence (ChInf) method that is the first to estimate the influence of different channels in MTS. Based on ChInf,we naturally derived two channel-wise algorithms by incorporating ChInf into classic MTS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ChInf and ChInf-based methods in critical MTS analysis tasks, such as MTS anomaly detection and MTS data pruning. Specifically, our ChInf-based methods rank top-1 among all methods for comparison, while previous influence functions do not perform well on MTS anomaly detection tasks and MTS data pruning problem. This fully supports the superiority and necessity of ChInf.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that combines the signature transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance. Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences. This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new locations with minimal historical context. Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictability of Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16312v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEM: Empowering MLLM for Grounded ECG Understanding with Time Series and Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06073v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Prediction-Powered Inference through Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16166v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction-powered inference is a recent methodology for the safe use of black-box ML models to impute missing data, strengthening inference of statistical parameters. However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting the U.S. Renewable-Energy Mix with an ALR-BDARMA Compositional Time-Series Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04087v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasts of the US renewable-generation mix are critical for planning transmission upgrades, sizing storage, and setting balancing-market rules. We present a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (BDARMA) model for monthly shares of hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, wood, municipal waste, and biofuels from January 2010 to January 2025. The mean vector follows a parsimonious VAR(2) in additive-log-ratio space, while the Dirichlet concentration parameter combines an intercept with ten Fourier harmonics, letting predictive dispersion expand or contract with the seasons. A 61-split rolling-origin study generates twelve-month density forecasts from January 2019 to January 2024. Relative to three benchmarks, a Gaussian VAR(2) in transform space, a seasonal naive copy of last year's proportions, and a drift-free additive-log-ratio random walk, BDARMA lowers the mean continuous ranked probability score by fifteen to sixty percent, achieves component-wise ninety percent interval coverage close to nominal, and matches Gaussian VAR point accuracy through eight months with a maximum loss of 0.02 Aitchison units thereafter. BDARMA therefore delivers sharp, well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts of multivariate renewable-energy shares without sacrificing point precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chronos-2: From Univariate to Universal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15821v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A nonstationary seasonal Dynamic Factor Model: an application to temperature time series from the state of Minas Gerais](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15667v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scientific fields, such as agriculture, temperature time series are of interest both as explanatory variables and as objects of study in their own right. However, at the state level, incorporating information from all possible locations in an analysis can be overwhelming, while using a summary measure, such as the state-wide average temperature, can result in significant information loss. In this context, using Dynamic Factor Models (DFMs) provides a compelling alternative for analyzing such multivariate time series, as they allow for the extraction of a small number of common factors that capture the majority of the variability in the data. Given that temperature series are typically seasonal, this study applies a nonstationary seasonal DFM to analyze a multivariate temperature time series from the state of Minas Gerais. The results show that the data can be effectively represented by two seasonal factors: the first captures the general seasonal pattern of the state, while the second contrasts the months of highest annual temperatures between two distinct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented on the XVII MGEST (Lavras, Brazil - 2025)</p></details> |
| **[TokenTiming: A Dynamic Alignment Method for Universal Speculative Decoding Model Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15545v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Nonstationarity in Time Series: A Deterministic Trend Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07987v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper challenges the dominance of stochastic trend models by introducing the Seasonal-Trend-Stationary ARMA (STSA) framework, which models univariate nonstationary time series as stationary fluctuations around deterministic trend and seasonal components, incorporating a finite number of structural breaks. We propose methods for estimating the locations and numbers of breaks using a modified dynamic programming algorithm and a sequential prediction-interval procedure, and we outline strategies for specifying and estimating the full model. Empirical analysis of U.S. Retail Sales (2004-2025) shows that the STSA model accurately identifies structural breaks corresponding to major economic events, including the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 downturn. The decomposition into trend, seasonal, and ARMA components provides a realistic and interpretable representation of the underlying dynamics of the economic cycle, offering insights into the pace of growth within each regime, recurring seasonal patterns, and the persistence of short-term fluctuations. Although designed primarily for interpretability, STSA substantially outperforms Prophet and achieves forecasting accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art stochastic trend models (ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, Theta) on the M4 Competition monthly dataset, with particular advantages for series exhibiting abrupt structural changes, where stochastic models typically struggle to adapt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Streaming Time Series Forecasting with Adaptive Windowing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15404v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency, particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data, eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric Testing of Spatial Dependence in 2D and 3D Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15381v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible and robust nonparametric framework for testing spatial dependence in two- and three-dimensional random fields. Our approach involves converting spatial data into one-dimensional time series using space-filling Hilbert curves. We then apply ordinal pattern-based tests for serial dependence to this series. Because Hilbert curves preserve spatial locality, spatial dependence in the original field manifests as serial dependence in the transformed sequence. The approach is easy to implement, accommodates arbitrary grid sizes through generalized Hilbert (``gilbert'') curves, and naturally extends beyond three dimensions. This provides a practical and general alternative to existing methods based on spatial ordinal patterns, which are typically limited to two-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence Modeling with Spectral Mean Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15366v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Causal Time Series Modeling of Supraglacial Lake Evolution in Greenland under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15265v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable, invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability. Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth surface processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper in ICMLA 2025 (Special Session 1: Deep Learning and Applications)</p></details> |
| **[Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Accuracy: Are Time Series Foundation Models Well-Calibrated?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16060v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of foundation models for time series data has generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16379v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic power is essential for reliable grid integration, yet remains difficult due to highly variable irradiance, complex meteorological drivers, site geography, and device-specific behavior. Although contemporary machine learning has achieved successes, it is not clear that these approaches are optimal: new model classes may further enhance performance and data efficiency. We investigate hybrid quantum neural networks for time-series forecasting of photovoltaic power and introduce two architectures. The first, a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory model, reduces mean absolute error and mean squared error by more than 40% relative to the strongest baselines evaluated. The second, a Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence model, once trained, it predicts power for arbitrary forecast horizons without requiring prior meteorological inputs and achieves a 16% lower mean absolute error than the best baseline on this task. Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency. These results show that hybrid quantum models address key challenges in photovoltaic power forecasting and offer a practical route to more reliable, data-efficient energy predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Tackling Time-Series Forecasting Generalization via Mitigating Concept Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14814v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series: concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting, designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received comparatively less attention. Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We develop a Bayesian framework based on the Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling threshold exceedances, providing posterior distributions for the GP parameters and tail quantiles in time series. Two cases are considered: extrapolation of tail quantiles for the stationary marginal distribution under beta-mixing dependence, and dynamic, past-conditional tail quantiles in heteroscedastic regression models. The proposal yields asymptotically honest credible regions, whose coverage probabilities converge to their nominal levels. We establish the asymptotic theory for the Bayesian procedure, deriving conditions on the prior distributions under which the posterior satisfies key asymptotic properties. To achieve this, we first develop a likelihood theory under serial dependence, providing local and global bounds for the empirical log-likelihood process of the misspecified GP model and deriving corresponding asymptotic properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Simulations demonstrate that our Bayesian credible regions outperform naive Bayesian and MLE-based confidence regions across several standard time series models, including ARMA, GARCH, and Markovian copula models. Two real-data applications-to U.S. interest rates and Swiss electricity demand-highlight the relevance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models, underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset, improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.</p></details> |  |

They can be combined with a variety of models to significantly improve prediction accuracy, at the same time offering easy implementation and low computational complexity. While their effectiveness has been repeatedly confirmed in prior scientific literature, the topic is still underexplored in the field of electricity price forecasting. In this research article we apply the Autoregressive Hybrid Nearest Neighbors (ARHNN) method to three long-term time series describing the German, Spanish and New England electricity markets. We show that it outperforms popular literature benchmarks in terms of forecast accuracy by up to 10%. We also propose two simplified variants of the method, granting a vast decrease in computation time with only minor loss of prediction accuracy. Finally, we compare the forecasts' performance in a battery storage system trading case study. We find that using a forecast-driven strategy can achieve up to 80% of theoretical maximum profits while trading, demonstrating business value in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

We study seasonal grazing detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for conservation-aligned land-use compliance.

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism - with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Prediction of Adverse Events in Medical Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14286v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new, relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms, and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points. These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned, stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

| **[Generalist vs Specialist Time Series Foundation Models: Investigating Potential Emergent Behaviors in Assessing Human Health Using PPG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14254v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</p></details> |  |

We formulate the parameter estimation as a Bayesian inverse problem. We consider a parametrized system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is the FitzHugh--Nagumo model. The considered problem exhibits significant mathematical and computational challenges for classical parameter estimation methods, including strong nonlinearities, nonconvexity, and sharp gradients. We explore how NNs overcome these challenges by approximating reconstruction maps for parameter estimation from observational data. The considered data are time series of the spiking membrane potential of a biological neuron. We infer parameters controlling the dynamics of the model, noise parameters of autocorrelated additive noise, and noise modeled via stochastic differential equations, as well as the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution to expose parameter uncertainties--all with just one forward evaluation of an appropriate NN. We report results for different NN architectures and study the influence of noise on prediction accuracy. We also report timing results for training NNs on dedicated hardware. Our results demonstrate that NNs are a versatile tool to estimate parameters of the dynamical system, stochastic processes, as well as uncertainties, as they propagate through the governing ODE.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 16 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |
| **[On Evaluating Loss Functions for Stock Ranking: An Empirical Analysis With Transformer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14156v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based trading strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level, offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level. TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons, and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights. The benchmark is available at: https://github.com/AdityaLab/TimeRecipe.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 1 figure, 30 tables</p></details> |

However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cyber-Resilient System Identification for Power Grid through Bayesian Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14043v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data, topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large 2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multifractality and its sources in the digital currency market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13785v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifractality in time series analysis characterizes the presence of multiple scaling exponents, indicating heterogeneous temporal structures and complex dynamical behaviors beyond simple monofractal models. In the context of digital currency markets, multifractal properties arise due to the interplay of long-range temporal correlations and heavy-tailed distributions of returns, reflecting intricate market microstructure and trader interactions. Incorporating multifractal analysis into the modeling of cryptocurrency price dynamics enhances the understanding of market inefficiencies, may improve volatility forecasting and facilitate the detection of critical transitions or regime shifts. Based on the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) whose spacial case is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical tools for quantifying multifractality, in the present contribution a recently proposed method of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series was applied to the most representative instruments from the digital market. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The results indicate the significant role of heavy tails in generating a broad multifractal spectrum. However, they also clearly demonstrate that the primary source of multifractality are temporal correlations in the series, and without them, multifractality fades out. It appears characteristic that these temporal correlations, to a large extent, do not depend on the thickness of the tails of the fluctuation distribution. These observations, made here in the context of the digital currency market, provide a further strong argument for the validity of the proposed methodology of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models: Benchmarking Challenges and Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13654v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a gate-based QRC for multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively, performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and, interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.</p></details> |  |

This traditional approach tends to prioritize one error indicator, which can bias results when metrics provide contradictory signals. In this context, the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF) is proposed as a multi-metric framework for hyperparameter optimization that integrates explanatory power (R2), sensitivity to extreme errors (RMSE), and average accuracy (MAE). The performance of HEF was assessed using four widely recognized benchmark datasets in the forecasting domain: the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets. Prediction models were optimized through Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and statistical analyses based on difference-of-proportions tests confirmed that HEF delivers superior results compared to a unimetric reference function, regardless of the optimizer employed, with particular relevance for heterogeneous monthly time series (M3) and highly granular daily demand scenarios (M5). The findings demonstrate that HEF improves stability, generalization, and robustness at a low computational cost, consolidating its role as a reliable evaluation framework that enhances model selection, enables more accurate demand forecasts, and supports decision-making in dynamic and competitive business environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 25 tables.

Unlike classical approaches in statistical inference, our approach avoids explicitly estimating the conditional probabilities. We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count processes, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures. We provide a margin condition that controls the rate of convergence for the risk. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the convergence rate of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, re-submitted.

However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions.

Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2) We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model. (3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.

Consequently, the Granger causality test has become one of the main concerns of the econometrician for decades. Taking advantage of the theoretical breakthroughs in deep learning in recent years, we propose a doubly robust Granger causality test (DRGCT). Our method offers several key advantages. The first and most direct benefit is for the users, DRGCT allows them to handle large lag orders while alleviating the curse of dimensionality that traditional nonlinear Granger causality tests usually face. Second, introducing a doubly robust test statistic for time series based on neural networks that achieves a parametric convergence rate not only suggests a new paradigm for nonparametric inference in econometrics, but also broadens the application scope of deep learning. Third, a multiplier bootstrap method, combined with the doubly robust approach, provides an efficient way to obtain critical values, effectively reducing computational time and avoiding redundant calculations. We prove that the test asymptotically controls the type I error, while achieving power approaches one, and validate the effectiveness of our test through numerical simulations. In real data analysis, we apply DRGCT to revisit the price-volume relationship problem in the stock markets of America, China, and Japan.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13029v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition, trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</p></details> |  |

The case study focuses on the UK to Win Horse Racing market during the pre-live stage on the world's leading betting exchange, Betfair. Innovative convolutional attention mechanisms are introduced and applied to multiple recurrent neural networks and bi-dimensional convolutional recurrent neural network layers.

| **[CoRA: Covariate-Aware Adaptation of Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12681v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting. Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities, presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |

Given that time series data can exhibit different patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies. Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the thirty-ninth annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |

| **[From Equations to Insights: Unraveling Symbolic Structures in PDEs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09986v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse fields, the application of AI to solve scientific problems, often formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs), has garnered increasing attention. While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of symbolic machine learning for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hey Pentti, We Did It Again!: Differentiable vector-symbolic types that prove polynomial termination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16533v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card, 1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000), exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020; Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATA: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Implement Autonomous and Trustworthy Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16381v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, includes figures and tables; introduces the FinChain benchmark and ChainEval metric</p></details> |
| **[Point or Line? Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23395v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13796v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.</p></details> |  |

Apple's Find My is perhaps the most ubiquitous such system which can even locate devices which do not possess any cellular support or GPS, running on millions of devices worldwide. Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks. In this paper, we present a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties, and provide automated, machine-checkable proofs of these properties in the Tamarin prover.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbol Grounding in Neuro-Symbolic AI: A Gentle Introduction to Reasoning Shortcuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14538v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></details> |  |

Existing DJSCC approaches focus primarily on point-to-point wireless communication scenarios, while neglecting end-to-end communication efficiency in hybrid wireless-wired networks such as 5G and 6G communication systems. Considerable redundancy in DJSCC symbols against wireless channels becomes inefficient for long-distance wired transmission. Furthermore, DJSCC symbols must adapt to the varying transmission rate of the wired network to avoid congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed for efficient wired transmission of DJSCC symbols within hybrid wireless-wired networks, namely Rate-Controllable Wired Adaptor (RCWA). RCWA achieves redundancy-aware coding for DJSCC symbols to improve transmission efficiency, which removes considerable redundancy present in DJSCC symbols for wireless channels and encodes only source-relevant information into bits. Moreover, we leverage the Lagrangian multiplier method to achieve controllable and continuous variable-rate coding, which can encode given features into expected rates, thereby minimizing end-to-end distortion while satisfying given constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior RD performance and robustness of RCWA compared to existing baselines, validating its potential for wired resource utilization in hybrid transmission scenarios. Specifically, our method can obtain peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of up to 0.7dB and 4dB compared to neural network-based methods and digital baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn after identifying that results in Section 5 require additional re-analysis before public dissemination</p></details> |

Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://onelife-worldmodel.github.io/; 39 pages</p></details> |

This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3figures.

| **[Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.</p></details> |  |

We propose logistic-gated operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness -- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, individuals with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the "digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models (LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts. Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200 semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves underprivileged populations with limited formal education.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |

The proposed approach learns simultaneously the partition of the input domain (splitting logic) as well as local nonlinear expressions for predicting the control action leading to interpretable piecewise nonlinear control laws. The local nonlinear expressions are determined by the learning problem and are modeled using a set of basis functions. The learning task is posed as a mixed integer optimization, which is solved to global optimality with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers. We apply the proposed approach to a case study regarding the control of an isothermal reactor. The results show that the proposed approach can learn the control law accurately, leading to closed-loop performance comparable to that of a standard model predictive controller. Finally, comparison with existing interpretable models shows that the symbolic trees achieve both lower prediction error and superior closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proof Strategy Extraction from LLMs for Enhancing Symbolic Provers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10131v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One important approach to software verification is interactive theorem proving. However, writing formal proofs often requires substantial human effort, making proof automation highly important. Traditionally, proof automation has relied on symbolic provers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in theorem proving, complementing symbolic provers. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs can be expensive and may pose security risks for confidential codebases. As a result, purely symbolic approaches remain important even in the LLM era, as they are cost-effective, secure, and complement the strengths of LLMs. Motivated by these considerations, we ask a new research question: can we extract the internal strategies of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of symbolic provers? As an initial attempt to answer this question, we propose Strat2Rocq, which extracts proof strategies from LLMs and formalizes them as lemmas in Rocq. These lemmas are accessible to symbolic provers such as CoqHammer. With the addition of these LLM-extracted lemmas, CoqHammer is able to prove more theorems. The knowledge extraction process involves analyzing the proof trajectories of LLMs on a training set of proved theorems. For each theorem, we prompt the LLM to generate a natural language proof, then ask it to summarize this proof into formalized lemmas with proofs. We also employ a standard agentic approach to mitigate errors during formalization. Our evaluation demonstrates that, on open-source Rocq projects for software verification, Strat2Rocq enhances the success rate of CoqHammer by 13.41%.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[NL2GenSym: Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules for SOAR Cognitive Architecture via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09355v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning LLM+PDDL Symbolic Plans with Human Objective Specifications through Evolutionary Algorithm Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00300v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated planning using a symbolic planning language, such as PDDL, is a general approach to producing optimal plans to achieve a stated goal. However, creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored utilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to generate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human (LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to a set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. We account for this using an evolutionary approach to generate a population of symbolic goal specifications with slight differences from the initial translation, and utilize a trained LSTM-based validation model to assess whether each induced plan in the population adheres to the natural language specifications. We evaluate our approach on a collection of prototypical specifications in a notional naval disaster recovery task, and demonstrate that our evolutionary approach improve adherence of generated plans to natural language specifications when compared to plans generated using only LLM translations. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/owenonline/PlanCritic.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Iterated Agent for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08317v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing, RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both the C and Rust functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages to appear in Proceedings of ASE 2025</p></details> |

Genetic programming based techniques are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently, neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures. We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based symbolic regression.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 3 Figurees |
| **[Tempo: Compiled Dynamic Deep Learning with Symbolic Dependence Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05408v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of temporal relationships: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such dynamic dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while eager DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; graph-based systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs. We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with recurrent tensors, which include explicit temporal dimensions. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using symbolic expressions to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a symbolic dependence graph, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 24 figures, 3 bibliography pages</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06774v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive, multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods, yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement. Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06635v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws. However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN. Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[BACHI: Boundary-Aware Symbolic Chord Recognition Through Masked Iterative Decoding on Pop and Classical Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06528v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module.</p></details> | Under review |

To address this, we introduce AGENT+P, a novel framework that leverages symbolic planning to guide LLM-based UI agents. Specifically, we model an app's UI transition structure as a UI Transition Graph (UTG), which allows us to reformulate the UI automation task as a pathfinding problem on the UTG. This further enables an off-the-shelf symbolic planner to generate a provably correct and optimal high-level plan, preventing the agent from redundant exploration and guiding the agent to achieve the automation goals. AGENT+P is designed as a plug-and-play framework to enhance existing UI agents. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark demonstrates that AGENT+P improves the success rates of state-of-the-art UI agents by up to 14% and reduces the action steps by 37.7%.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages double column; two figures</p></details> |

We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.</p></details> |  |

Exploring How Humans and AI Interact with Symbols and Meanings in Their Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05378v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction, AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation. Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols, suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.</p></details> | CHI 2026 Papers |

Investigating Memorization, Emergence, and Symbolic Processing in In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11004v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more informed guidelines.</p></details> | TMLR |
| **[Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning remains a core challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LLMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. Conceptually, SymPlanner operationalizes two cognitive faculties: (i) error monitoring and repair via externalized feedback (IC) and (ii) preference formation among alternatives via pairwise comparison (CR), advancing cognitively plausible, symbol-grounded planning aligned with the rich structure in intelligent systems. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Twelfth Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems</p></details> |

By incorporating these symbolic structures, Symbolic-Aided CoT preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning tasks and scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules.

Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR. Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates the BER performance degradation caused by STO.</p></details> |  |

However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined tem plates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-attributes-relations paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to visual and textual representations and generates reasoning path with reverse search and forward validation. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.s</p></details> | 29 pages |

We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian (self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second, we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own. This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 table (in appendix)</p></details> |

This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP) and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately 80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[OntoURL: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Symbolic Ontological Understanding, Reasoning and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11031v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in handling ontologies -- formal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in LLMS via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.</p></details> |  |

Two major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency, preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline, SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time. Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation, SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to 6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal specifications.

| **[Neuro-Symbolic AI for Analytical Solutions of Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01476v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analytical solutions of differential equations offer exact insights into fundamental behaviors of physical processes. Their application, however, is limited as finding these solutions is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we combine two key insights. First, constructing an analytical solution requires a composition of foundational solution components. Second, iterative solvers define parameterized function spaces with constraint-based updates. Our approach merges compositional differential equation solution techniques with iterative refinement by using formal grammars, building a rich space of candidate solutions that are embedded into a low-dimensional (continuous) latent manifold for probabilistic exploration. This integration unifies numerical and symbolic differential equation solvers via a neuro-symbolic AI framework to find analytical solutions of a wide variety of differential equations. By systematically constructing candidate expressions and applying constraint-based refinement, we overcome longstanding barriers to extract such closed-form solutions. We illustrate advantages over commercial solvers, symbolic methods, and approximate neural networks on a diverse set of problems, demonstrating both generality and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic and High-Accuracy Solutions to Differential and Integral Problems via a Novel Recursive Inverse Laplace Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00719v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-analytical method for solving a broad class of initial value problems involving differential, integro-differential, and delay equations, including those with fractional and variable-order derivatives. The proposed approach is based on the inverse Laplace transform, applied initially - unlike traditional Laplace-based techniques which begin with a forward transformation. By assuming the unknown solution is the Laplace transform of an auxiliary function, the method reformulates the problem in the time domain and recursively solves for this function using symbolic operations. The final solution is then obtained by applying the Laplace transform to the result. This strategy enables the construction of symbolic solutions as generalized logarithmic-power series with arbitrary accuracy, and naturally accommodates complex terms. The method is highly versatile and demonstrates superior speed and precision across a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems, including singular, fractional, and chaotic systems. Several benchmark examples are provided to validate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed technique compared to classical numerical methods. The results confirm that the new method offers a powerful and flexible framework for symbolic computation of initial value problems.</p></details> |  |

Each task presents an incorrect matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing compositional reasoning across vision and symbols.

To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[GeoSketch: A Neural-Symbolic Approach to Geometric Multimodal Reasoning with Auxiliary Line Construction and Affine Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22460v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuSLR: Multimodal Symbolic Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25851v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements.

| **[Finetuning Large Language Model as an Effective Symbolic Regressor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09897v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language Models, (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treat complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises over 148,000 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference. Further, to ensure a more comprehensive and fair evaluation, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish Symbolic-R1, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental results validate Symbolic-R1 as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 10.3% in form-level consistency score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Norm-Q: Effective Compression Method for Hidden Markov Models in Neuro-Symbolic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25439v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3 bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at https://github.com/superstarghy/Norm-Q.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Asilomar 2025</p></details> |

Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering "Words" in Music: Unsupervised Learning of Compositional Sparse Code for Symbolic Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24603v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Entity Alignment via Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04153v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity alignment (EA) aims to merge two knowledge graphs (KGs) by identifying equivalent entity pairs. Existing methods can be categorized into symbolic and neural models. Symbolic models, while precise, struggle with substructure heterogeneity and sparsity, whereas neural models, although effective, generally lack interpretability and cannot handle uncertainty. We propose NeuSymEA, a unified neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that combines the strengths of both methods to fully exploit the cross-KG structural pattern for robust entity alignment. NeuSymEA models the joint probability of all possible pairs' truth scores in a Markov random field, regulated by a set of rules, and optimizes it with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, a neural model parameterizes the truth score distributions and infers missing alignments. In the M-step, the rule weights are updated based on the observed and inferred alignments, handling uncertainty. We introduce an efficient symbolic inference engine driven by logic deduction, enabling reasoning with extended rule lengths. NeuSymEA achieves a significant 7.6\% hit@1 improvement on $\text{DBP15K}_{\text{ZH-EN}}$ compared with strong baselines and demonstrates robustness in low-resource settings, achieving 73.7\% hit@1 accuracy on $\text{DBP15K}_{\text{FR-EN}}$ with only 1\% pairs as seed alignments.

However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model (LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed. The results indicate that SIL significantly enhances policy transparency while maintaining strong performance across varied driving conditions.

Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.</p></details> |  |

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: T...</summary><p>v2: Two TMLR revision rounds addressing reviewer feedback.

While symbolic music has been widely used in generation tasks, LLM capabilities in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose ABC-Eval, the first open-source benchmark dedicated to the understanding and instruction-following capabilities in text-based ABC notation scores. It comprises 1,086 test samples spanning 10 sub-tasks, covering scenarios from basic musical syntax comprehension to complex sequence-level reasoning. Such a diverse scope poses substantial challenges to models' ability to handle symbolic music tasks. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs on ABC-Eval, and the results reveal notable limitations in existing models' symbolic music processing capabilities. Furthermore, the consistent performance of individual baselines across different sub-tasks supports the reliability of our benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Effective detection and elimination of these vulnerabilities during the testing phase are essential. Current methods, such as fuzzing, are widely used for this purpose. While fuzzing is efficient in identifying a broad range of bugs and vulnerabilities by using random mutations or generations, it does not guarantee correctness or absence of vulnerabilities. Therefore, non-random methods are preferable for ensuring the safety and security of critical infrastructure and control systems. This paper presents a vulnerability detection approach based on symbolic execution and control flow graph analysis to identify various types of software weaknesses. Our approach employs a divide-and-conquer algorithm to eliminate irrelevant program information, thus accelerating the process and enabling the analysis of larger programs compared to traditional symbolic execution and model checking methods.</p></details> |  |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present \textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\% accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.</p></details> |  |

Compared to other testing methods such as fuzzing, Symbolic Execution has the advantage of providing formal guarantees about the program. However, despite advances in performance in recent years, Symbolic Execution is too slow to be applied to real-world software. This is primarily caused by the \emph{path explosion problem} as well as by the computational complexity of SMT solving. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer approach for symbolic execution by executing individual slices and later combining the side effects. This way, the overall problem size is kept small, reducing the impact of computational complexity on large problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Form Interpretation of Neural Network Latent Spaces with Symbolic Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05305v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been demonstrated that artificial neural networks like autoencoders or Siamese networks encode meaningful concepts in their latent spaces. However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In quantitative disciplines concepts are typically formulated as equations. Hence, in order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. Computationally, this framework is based on finding a symbolic expression whose normalized gradients match the normalized gradients of a specific neuron with respect to the input variables. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major Revision, new code for experiments, reflect author contributions</p></details> |

At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Approaches using generative methods, particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan. We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial and complete symbolic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Beyond Formula Complexity: Effective Information Criterion Improves Performance and Interpretability for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21780v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system. We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts' preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Symbolic Computation via Hash Consing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20534v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation, simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster, function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100 times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in AI-driven pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic Learnable Context Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21035v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering, but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the distributed camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. In this position paper, I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both distributed/continuous/fuzzy and symbolic/discrete/categorical-like representations and processing; 2) models trained on language make use of this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it makes them particularly interesting for the study of language.

Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Generalization in Pre-Trained Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19849v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |

However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this repository.}</p></details> |  |
| **[System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models Beyond User Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Multi-Path Plan Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11620v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model (LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (20 pages, 10 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/simko/)</p></details> |
| **[Are LLMs Stable Formal Logic Translators in Logical Reasoning Across Linguistically Diversified Texts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LinguDiver.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this organization, we propose Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo): a modular, transformer-based architecture post-trained with a curriculum that induces functional specialization across experts. Concretely, we partition the layers of a pretrained language model into four expert modules aligned with well-studied cognitive networks in the human brain. MiCRo offers three key advantages over standard language models. (1) The specialized experts are interpretable and causally meaningful -- ablating a module causes substantial drops on benchmarks requiring its specialized domain. (2) MiCRo's behavior can be dynamically steered at inference time by routing tokens to particular experts (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over outputs. (3) MiCRo outperforms or matches comparable baselines on both machine-learning reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, BBH) and alignment to human behavior (CogBench), while maintaining interpretability. Taken together, cognitively grounded functional specialization yields models that are both more human-like and more human-interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, whether they can flexibly apply appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization. Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning. Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.

Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture, where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate (logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge, demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly, aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO, where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more advanced and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing benchmarks are limited to English, creating a significant gap for low-resource languages. For example, Bangla is spoken by nearly 250 million people who would collectively benefit from LLMs capable of native fluency. To address this, we present BanglaMATH, a dataset of 1.7k Bangla math word problems across topics such as Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Logical Reasoning, sourced from Bangla elementary school workbooks and annotated with details like grade level and number of reasoning steps. We have designed BanglaMATH to evaluate the mathematical capabilities of both commercial and open-source LLMs in Bangla, and we find that Gemini 2.5 Flash and DeepSeek V3 are the only models to achieve strong performance, with $\ge$ 80\% accuracy across three elementary school grades. Furthermore, we assess the robustness and language bias of these top-performing LLMs by augmenting the original problems with distracting information, and translating the problems into English. We show that both LLMs fail to maintain robustness and exhibit significant performance bias in Bangla. Our study underlines current limitations of LLMs in handling arithmetic and mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages, and highlights the need for further research on multilingual and equitable mathematical understanding.

| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g., arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation & Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3) Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated reasoning skills.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extended Triangular Method: A Generalized Algorithm for Contradiction Separation Based Automated Deduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10701v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning. Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018, proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.</p></details> | 38 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DUMP: Automated Distribution-Level Curriculum Learning for RL-based LLM Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09710v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

| **[CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09472v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that a small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the logical inference required by the task.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce LaV-CoT, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment.

Several approaches have been proposed to apply LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[SOP-Maze: Evaluating Large Language Models on Complicated Business Standard Operating Procedures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08942v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures; (ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions. Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |

Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level probing. Leveraging this framework, we conduct a comprehensive study on how different supervision formats in fine-tuning shape reasoning abilities. We fine-tune LLMs on four supervision styles: one in natural language and three symbolic variants. We find a key trade-off: natural language supervision excels at generalization to out-of-distribution and long-chain problems, whereas symbolic supervision is superior at instilling structurally sound, atomic reasoning steps. Furthermore, our probing analysis indicates that fine-tuning primarily refines the model's step-by-step generation process, rather than improving its ability to converge on an answer early. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/FineLogic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL, it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically grounded method for trustworthy AI.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |

Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.</p></details> |  |

Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et. al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation.

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the real-world tasks in the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. Each task requires a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates, respectively. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80,000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution, through which a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models. Finally, we provide an in-depth failure analysis to understand the limitations of different models. We will publicly release the benchmark for future research on program synthesis in visual programming.</p></details> | ACL'25 paper |

To better understand how humans might collaborate effectively with AI, we evaluate the performance of crowd workers on these individual reasoning subtasks. We find that while humans excel at knowledge integration (97\% accuracy), they often fail to recognize when a question requires multi-hop reasoning (67\% accuracy). Participants perform reasonably well on both single-hop and multi-hop QA (84\% and 80\% accuracy, respectively), but frequently make semantic mistakes--for example, answering "when" an event happened when the question asked "where." These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that complement human strengths while compensating for common weaknesses.</p></details> |  |

However, these benchmarks tend to become easier over time as LLMs can learn from the published benchmarks. This limitation hinder the precise evaluation of the true capabilities of SOTA models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. Experimental results demonstrate that EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model accuracy by an average of 48\%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving these evolved problems, LLMs tend to bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning by relying on simplistic and fuzzy conditions, consequently leading to incorrect solutions. We define this phenomenon as the ``Pseudo Aha Moment", which we find accounts for 77\% to 100\% of errors on targeted problems.

The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-interactive reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, Symbolic-Aided CoT preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning tasks and scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 39th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 39)</p></details> |
| **[Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Gala, a framework that addresses this challenge with a global agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Has the Two-Decade-Old Prophecy Come True? Artificial Bad Intelligence Triggered by Merely a Single-Bit Flip in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00490v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) has garnered widespread attention for its ability to compromise software system integrity remotely through hardware fault injection. With the widespread distillation and deployment of large language models (LLMs) into single file .gguf formats, their weight spaces have become exposed to an unprecedented hardware attack surface. This paper is the first to systematically discover and validate the existence of single-bit vulnerabilities in LLM weight files: in mainstream open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek and QWEN) using .gguf quantized formats, flipping just single bit can induce three types of targeted semantic level failures Artificial Flawed Intelligence (outputting factual errors), Artificial Weak Intelligence (degradation of logical reasoning capability), and Artificial Bad Intelligence (generating harmful content). By building an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and a probabilistic heuristic scanning framework called BitSifter, we achieved efficient localization of critical vulnerable bits in models with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments show that vulnerabilities are significantly concentrated in the tensor data region, particularly in areas related to the attention mechanism and output layers, which are the most sensitive. A negative correlation was observed between model size and robustness, with smaller models being more susceptible to attacks. Furthermore, a remote BFA chain was designed, enabling semantic-level attacks in real-world environments: At an attack frequency of 464.3 times per second, a single bit can be flipped with 100% success in as little as 31.7 seconds. This causes the accuracy of LLM to plummet from 73.5% to 0%, without requiring high-cost equipment or complex prompt engineering.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Aristotle: Mastering Logical Reasoning with A Logic-Complete Decompose-Search-Resolve Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16953v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://llm-symbol.github.io/Aristotle/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24765v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL), while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94) and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05% average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Rectification Sampling for Test-Time Compute Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01317v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chains of thought (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicates that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[OIG-Bench: A Multi-Agent Annotated Benchmark for Multimodal One-Image Guides Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00069v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%. Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science.

| **[SCI-Verifier: Scientific Verifier with Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24285v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper focuses on LLM-as-a-Judge, and the project is currently in progress</p></details> |

Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation. We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).</p></details> | preprint |
| **[DEL-ToM: Inference-Time Scaling for Theory-of-Mind Reasoning via Dynamic Epistemic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17348v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack the capability for dynamic logical reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves verifiable ToM reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and verifiable dynamic logical reasoning. We use data generated automatically via a DEL simulator to train a verifier, which we call the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each belief update step. During inference, the PBM evaluates candidate belief traces from the LLM and selects the highest-scoring one. This allows LLMs to allocate extra inference-time compute to yield more transparent reasoning. Experiments across model scales and benchmarks show that DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief supervision significantly enhances LLMs' ToM capabilities without retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/joel-wu/DEL-ToM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Chain of Thought Enables Parallel Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23648v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work provides new theoretical guarantees and algorithms for CoT2, motivated by logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities. Theoretically, we establish how CoT2 facilitates the model to track multiple discrete traces in parallel; and quantify the level of achievable parallelism and its benefits for inference efficiency. We also provide a CoT2-based one-layer transformer construction that solves the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given a sufficient embedding dimension. These insights arise from a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the language model outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization methods for CoT2. Our primary strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism. Experiments confirm that (i) the optimal level of parallelism is governed by the embedding dimension, (ii) our continuous supervision strategy can outperform alternative methods, and (iii) policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason in Structured In-context Environments with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23330v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability. However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment (SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment, leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm, particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT) and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$ of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks. Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Socially via Cognitive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22546v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs. CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/thu-coai/CogFlow</p></details> |

Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025.

A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second, an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the crucial dimension of explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can GRPO Boost Complex Multimodal Table Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16889v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[SATBench: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Reasoning via Automated Puzzle Generation from SAT Formulas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14615v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.

| **[XAgents: A Framework for Interpretable Rule-Based Multi-Agents Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13932v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting implicit knowledge and logical reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) has consistently been a significant challenge. The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>We in...</summary><p>We intend to substantially revise the problem statement and scope; therefore we withdraw the current version</p></details> |

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach that involves a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive solution for audio logical reasoning (ALR) tasks: we introduce SoundMind, a dataset of 6,446 audio-text annotated samples specifically curated to support complex reasoning. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to equip audio-language models with robust audio-text reasoning capabilities. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the proposed SoundMind dataset using SoundMind-RL, we achieve strong and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SoundMind benchmark. This work highlights the benefit of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, and contributes to advancing auditory intelligence in language models.

While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption across and within different collaborative and social contexts. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Clari...</summary><p>Clarify the contextual positioning of our framework in relation to prior XAI design work and expand the review details</p></details> |
| **[Are LLMs Better Formalizers than Solvers on Complex Problems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13252v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A trending line of recent work advocates for using large language models (LLMs) as formalizers instead of as end-to-end solvers for logical reasoning problems. Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer.</p></details> |  |

The data format, named cognitive-logs, enables rigour and flexible logical reasoning. Cognitive-logs consist of a set of relational and graph databases. Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of "actions" represented by verbs in natural languages and "participants" who perform the actions. These objects are connected by arrows (morphisms) that bind each action to its participant and bind causes and effects. The design principle of cognitive-logs refers cognitive sciences especially in cognitive linguistics. Logical reasoning is the processes of comparing causal chains in episodic memories with known rules which are also recorded in the cognitive-logs. Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories. The goal of this study is to develop a database-driven artificial intelligence that thinks like a human but possesses the accuracy and rigour of a machine. The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences. Cognitive-logs also serve as a model of human cognition mind activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71.

In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main), 9+6 pages</p></details> |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages |

We measured the accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June 2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025. We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15 billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3, an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted as a main track paper for publication in the proceedings of the Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025 held in Canberra, Australia</p></details> |

However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[NIRS: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies as alternatives to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal is to develop NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences. Results: The ontology has 129 classes, 11 object properties, and 17 data properties across 886 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 361 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes: for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation. Conclusion: We developed an ontology that captures NIRS modalities in a unified framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies, which may need to be expanded to encompass a broader scope.</p></details> |  |

Using data from U.S. presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall, basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy classification in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side. The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reasoning Quality in Large Language Models through Enhanced Chain-of-Thought via RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06024v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer. Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.</p></details> |  |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings. 23 pages, 23 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Sensitivity and Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language (NL) statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text, often go unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based metrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding ground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of FOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator and text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric sensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics against LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation affects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL metric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between BertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 19th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning, 2025</p></details> |
| **[CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Chain-of-Thought: The Roles of In-Context Learning and Pre-trained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01236v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATQuest: A Verifier for Logical Reasoning Evaluation and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00930v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional, systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, many complex real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |

However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models (LLMs) for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20030v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to simplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis on their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case studies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA, providing valuable insights for researchers interested in leveraging advanced AI technologies for EDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference</p></details> |

The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR camera ready + additional discussion in the appendix</p></details> |
| **[Logical Reasoning with Outcome Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19903v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

We introduce a dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs, they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and their interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication at the IEEE Transactions on Games 2024, Special Issue on Large Language Models and Games (10 pages excluding appendix, 3 figures)</p></details> |

A Multi-Dimensional Truthfulness Evaluation of Quantized LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19432v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025 main conference (poster)</p></details> |

However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop LLM-driven UAV operation code generation framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into semantic trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLP 2025, part of ECPTS</p></details> |

Previous MI research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g., "Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</p></details> | Under review |

In this work, we investigate their capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity. Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification, outperforming Mathematica in various cases.</p></details> |  |

However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.</p></details> |  |
