In this extended abstract, we detail our attempt to build a neural algorithmic reasoner that can solve Knapsack, a pseudo-polynomial problem bridging classical algorithms and combinatorial optimisation, but omitted in standard NAR benchmarks. Our neural algorithmic reasoner is designed to closely follow the two-phase pipeline for the Knapsack problem, which involves first constructing the dynamic programming table and then reconstructing the solution from it. The approach, which models intermediate states through dynamic programming supervision, achieves better generalization to larger problem instances than a direct-prediction baseline that attempts to select the optimal subset only from the problem inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables, 3 listings</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Task Learning for Sparsity Pattern Heterogeneity: Statistical and Computational Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08697v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a problem in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) where multiple linear models are jointly trained on a collection of datasets ("tasks"). A key novelty of our framework is that it allows the sparsity pattern of regression coefficients and the values of non-zero coefficients to differ across tasks while still leveraging partially shared structure. Our methods encourage models to share information across tasks through separately encouraging 1) coefficient supports, and/or 2) nonzero coefficient values to be similar. This allows models to borrow strength during variable selection even when non-zero coefficient values differ across tasks. We propose a novel mixed-integer programming formulation for our estimator. We develop custom scalable algorithms based on block coordinate descent and combinatorial local search to obtain high-quality (approximate) solutions for our estimator. Additionally, we propose a novel exact optimization algorithm to obtain globally optimal solutions. We investigate the theoretical properties of our estimators. We formally show how our estimators leverage the shared support information across tasks to achieve better variable selection performance. We evaluate the performance of our methods in simulations and two biomedical applications. Our proposed approaches appear to outperform other sparse MTL methods in variable selection and prediction accuracy. We provide the sMTL package on CRAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Royal Statistical Society, Series B (to appear)</p></details> |
| **[Meta-Learning for Quantum Optimization via Quantum Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05058v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum processors. However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a "learning to learn" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Online Bid Optimization with Return on Investment and Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07139v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In online marketing, the advertisers aim to balance achieving high volumes and high profitability. The companies' business units address this tradeoff by maximizing the volumes while guaranteeing a minimum Return On Investment (ROI) level. Such a task can be naturally modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem subject to ROI and budget constraints that can be solved online. In this picture, the learner's uncertainty over the constraints' parameters plays a crucial role since the algorithms' exploration choices might lead to their violation during the entire learning process. Such violations represent a major obstacle to adopting online techniques in real-world applications. Thus, controlling the algorithms' exploration during learning is paramount to making humans trust online learning tools. This paper studies the nature of both optimization and learning problems. In particular, we show that the learning problem is inapproximable within any factor (unless P = NP) and provide a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm to solve its discretized version. Subsequently, we prove that no online learning algorithm can violate the (ROI or budget) constraints a sublinear number of times during the learning process while guaranteeing a sublinear regret. We provide the $GCB$ algorithm that guarantees sublinear regret at the cost of a linear number of constraint violations and $GCB_{safe}$ that guarantees w.h.p. a constant upper bound on the number of constraint violations at the cost of a linear regret. Moreover, we designed $GCB_{safe}(ψ,φ)$, which guarantees both sublinear regret and safety w.h.p. at the cost of accepting tolerances $ψ$ and $φ$ in the satisfaction of the ROI and budget constraints, respectively. Finally, we provide experimental results to compare the regret and constraint violations of $GCB$, $GCB_{safe}$, and $GCB_{safe}(ψ,φ)$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Inspired Optimization through Qudit-Based Imaginary Time Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04710v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaginary-time evolution has been shown to be a promising framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Optimal Experiment Design in Linear non-Gaussian Cyclic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21423v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoCo: Role-Based LLMs Collaboration for Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03762v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative algorithm performance evaluation and prediction for the maximum clique problem using instance space analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03419v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The maximum clique problem, a well-known graph-based combinatorial optimization problem, has been addressed through various algorithmic approaches, though systematic analyses of the problem instances remain sparse. This study employs the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology to systematically analyze the instance space of this problem and assess & predict the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, including exact, heuristic, and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods. A dataset was compiled using graph instances from TWITTER, COLLAB and IMDB-BINARY benchmarks commonly used in graph machine learning research. A set of 33 generic and 2 problem-specific polynomial-time-computable graph-based features, including several spectral properties, was employed for the ISA. A composite performance mea- sure incorporating both solution quality and algorithm runtime was utilized. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the exact algorithm Mixed Order Maximum Clique (MOMC) exhib- ited superior performance across approximately 74.7% of the instance space constituted by the compiled dataset. Gurobi & CliSAT accounted for superior performance in 13.8% and 11% of the instance space, respectively. The ISA-based algorithm performance prediction model run on 34 challenging test instances compiled from the BHOSLIB and DIMACS datasets yielded top-1 and top-2 best performing algorithm prediction accuracies of 88% and 97%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |Σ(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums. We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes. To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds. Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, includes full algorithmic framework and empirical validation.

| **[Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A Combinatorial Characterization of Constant Mixing Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21868v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spectral graph theory characterizes graphs with logarithmic mixing time. In this work, we present a combinatorial characterization of graphs with constant mixing time. The combinatorial characterization is based on the small-set bipartite density condition, which is weaker than having near-optimal spectral radius and is stronger than having near-optimal small-set vertex expansion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manual-PA: Learning 3D Part Assembly from Instruction Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18011v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assembling furniture amounts to solving the discrete-continuous optimization task of selecting the furniture parts to assemble and estimating their connecting poses in a physically realistic manner. The problem is hampered by its combinatorially large yet sparse solution space thus making learning to assemble a challenging task for current machine learning models. In this paper, we attempt to solve this task by leveraging the assembly instructions provided in diagrammatic manuals that typically accompany the furniture parts. Our key insight is to use the cues in these diagrams to split the problem into discrete and continuous phases. Specifically, we present Manual-PA, a transformer-based instruction Manual-guided 3D Part Assembly framework that learns to semantically align 3D parts with their illustrations in the manuals using a contrastive learning backbone towards predicting the assembly order and infers the 6D pose of each part via relating it to the final furniture depicted in the manual. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the benchmark PartNet dataset. Our results show that using the diagrams and the order of the parts lead to significant improvements in assembly performance against the state of the art. Further, Manual-PA demonstrates strong generalization to real-world IKEA furniture assembly on the IKEA-Manual dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV'25 |
| **[Generalized Short Path Algorithms: Towards Super-Quadratic Speedup over Markov Chain Search for Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23270v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze generalizations of quantum algorithms based on the short path framework first proposed by Hastings~[\textit{Quantum} 2, 78 (2018)], which has been extended and shown by Dalzell~et~al.~[STOC~'23] to achieve super-Grover speedups for certain binary optimization problems. We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max Bisection, Max Independent Set, and finding the ground states of the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable with previous short path techniques. In certain cases, our algorithms achieve super-quadratic speedups compared to the best known classical algorithms with rigorously established runtimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse PCA With Multiple Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14790v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Principal Component Analysis (sPCA) is a cardinal technique for obtaining combinations of features, or principal components (PCs), that explain the variance of high-dimensional datasets in an interpretable manner. This involves solving a sparsity and orthogonality constrained convex maximization problem, which is extremely computationally challenging. Most existing works address sparse PCA via methods-such as iteratively computing one sparse PC and deflating the covariance matrix-that do not guarantee the orthogonality, let alone the optimality, of the resulting solution when we seek multiple mutually orthogonal PCs. We challenge this status by reformulating the orthogonality conditions as rank constraints and optimizing over the sparsity and rank constraints simultaneously. We design tight semidefinite relaxations to supply high-quality upper bounds, which we strengthen via additional second-order cone inequalities when each PC's individual sparsity is specified. Further, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the maximum amount of variance explained as a function of the support. We exploit these relaxations and bounds to propose exact methods and rounding mechanisms that, together, obtain solutions with a bound gap on the order of 0%-15% for real-world datasets with p = 100s or 1000s of features and r \in {2, 3} components. Numerically, our algorithms match (and sometimes surpass) the best performing methods in terms of fraction of variance explained and systematically return PCs that are sparse and orthogonal. In contrast, we find that existing methods like deflation return solutions that violate the orthogonality constraints, even when the data is generated according to sparse orthogonal PCs. Altogether, our approach solves sparse PCA problems with multiple components to certifiable (near) optimality in a practically tractable fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added a new result (Theorem 3) showing sparse PCA with multiple PCs is NP-hard even if the support is fixed and partially overlapping</p></details> |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Method to Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13632v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, "black box" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PowerCLIP: Powerset Alignment for Contrastive Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23170v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Learning Branching Networks for Multitask Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01113v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together. We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs. We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages.

| **[Efficient Matroid Bandit Linear Optimization Leveraging Unimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00605v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem under matroid constraints. The regret achieved by recent approaches is optimal, in the sense that it matches the lower bound. Yet, time complexity remains an issue for large matroids or for matroids with costly membership oracles (e.g. online recommendation that ensures diversity). This paper sheds a new light on the matroid semi-bandit problem by exploiting its underlying unimodal structure. We demonstrate that, with negligible loss in regret, the number of iterations involving the membership oracle can be limited to \mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$. This results in an overall improved time complexity of the learning process. Experiments conducted on various matroid benchmarks show (i) no loss in regret compared to state-of-the-art approaches; and (ii) reduced time complexity and number of calls to the membership oracle.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEOAT: Personalization-Guided Evolutionary Question Assembly for One-Shot Adaptive Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00439v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has attracted increasing attention by integrating educational psychology with deep learning technologies. Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.</p></details> | AAAI-2026, 9 pages |
| **[On the Additivity of Optimal Rates for Independent Zero-Error Source and Channel Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02281v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-error coding encompasses a variety of source and channel problems where the probability of error must be exactly zero. This condition is stricter than that of the vanishing error regime, where the error probability goes to zero as the code blocklength goes to infinity. In general, zero-error coding is an open combinatorial question. We investigate two unsolved zero-error problems: the source coding problem with side information and the channel coding problem. We focus our attention on families of independent problems for which the probability distribution decomposes into a product of probability distributions. A crucial step is the additivity property of the optimal rate, which does not always hold in the zero-error regime, unlike in the vanishing error regime. When the additivity holds, the concatenation of optimal codes is optimal. We derive a condition under which the additivity of the complementary graph entropy $\overline{H}$ for the AND product of graphs and for the disjoint union of graphs are equivalent. Then we establish the connection with a recent result obtained by Wigderson and Zuiddam and by Schrijver, for the zero-error capacity $C_0$. As a consequence, we provide new single-letter characterizations of $\overline{H}$ and $C_0$, for example when the graph is a product of perfect graphs, which is not perfect in general, and for the class of graphs obtained by the product of a perfect graph $G$ with the pentagon graph $C_5$. By building on Haemers result for $C_0$, we also show that the additivity of $\overline{H}$ does not hold for the product of the Schläfli graph with its complementary graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Dynamic Associative Memory via Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23347v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc, model-level explainer based on association rule mining, and demonstrate it on the predictions of the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem (MCP), a canonical NP-hard graph-based COP. The eight most explanatory association rules discovered by ARM-Explainer achieve high median lift and confidence values of 2.42 and 0.49, respectively, on test instances from the TWITTER and BHOSLIB-DIMACS benchmark datasets. ARM-Explainer identifies the most important node features, together with their value ranges, that influence the GNN's predictions on these datasets. Furthermore, augmenting the GNN with informative node features substantially improves its performance on the MCP, increasing the median largest-found clique size by 22% (from 29.5 to 36) on large graphs from the BHOSLIB-DIMACS dataset.</p></details> |  |

Our work extends the classical Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting, incorporating substantial and novel components beyond standard inductive LRC analysis. Although LRC has been used to obtain sharp generalization bounds and minimax rates for inductive tasks such as classification and nonparametric regression, it has remained an open problem whether a localized Rademacher complexity framework can be effectively adapted to transductive learning to achieve sharp or nearly sharp bounds consistent with inductive results. We provide an affirmative answer via TLC. TLC is constructed by first deriving a new concentration inequality in Theorem 4.1 for the supremum of empirical processes capturing the gap between test and training losses, termed the test-train process, under uniform sampling without replacement, which leverages a novel combinatorial property of the test-train process and a new proof strategy applying the exponential Efron-Stein inequality twice. A subsequent peeling strategy and a new surrogate variance operator then yield excess risk bounds in the transductive setting that are nearly consistent with classical LRC-based inductive bounds up to a logarithmic gap. We further advance transductive learning through two applications: (1) for realizable transductive learning over binary-valued classes with finite VC dimension and $u \ge m \ge \dVC$ where $u$ and $m$ are the number of test features and training features, our Theorem 6.1 gives a nearly optimal bound $Θ(\dVC \log(me/\dVC)/m)$ matching the minimax rate $Θ(\dVC/m)$ up to $\log m$, resolving a decade-old open question; and (2) Theorem 6.3 presents a sharper excess risk bound for transductive kernel learning compared to the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conference version (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=NRVdvg7VMn) at ICML 2025 is a special case of this paper where the length of the chain set to 2 (that is $Q=2$, please refer to Def. 5.1), and the main results of the conference version are direct consequences of the main results in this paper</p></details> |

Broadly, deep reinforcement learning algorithms fall into two categories: policy-gradient and value-based. While value-based algorithms have achieved notable success in domains such as the Arcade Learning Environment, the combinatorial optimization community has predominantly favored policy-gradient algorithms, often overlooking the potential of value-based alternatives. From our results, value-based algorithms demonstrated a lower variance and a more stable convergence profile compared to policy-gradient ones. Moreover, they achieved superior cross-size and cross-distribution generalization, that is, effectively solving instances that are substantially larger or structurally distinct from those seen during training. Finally, our analysis also suggests that the relative performance of each category of algorithms may be dependent on structural properties of the problem, such as problem flexibility and instance size. Overall, our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that policy-gradient algorithms are inherently superior for combinatorial optimization. We show instead that value-based algorithms can match or even surpass the performance of policy-gradient algorithms, suggesting that they deserve greater attention from the combinatorial optimization community.

Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions. This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal version of arXiv:2505.18269</p></details> |

It has applications in many algorithmic and combinatorial problems. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs admitting a convex drawing (a straight-line drawing where all vertices lie on a circle) in which every edge crosses at most $k$ other edges. We also consider the more general class of outer min-$k$-planar graphs, which are graphs admitting a convex drawing where for every crossing of two edges at least one of these edges is crossed at most $k$ times. Firman, Gutowski, Kryven, Okada and Wolff [GD 2024] proved that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $1.5k+2$ and provided a lower bound of $k+2$ for even $k$. We establish a lower bound of $1.5k+0.5$ for every odd $k$. Additionally, they showed that every outer min-$k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k+1$. We improve this upper bound to $3 \cdot \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+4$. Our approach also allows us to upper bound the separation number, a parameter closely related to treewidth, of outer min-$k$-planar graphs by $2 \cdot \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+4$. This improves upon the previous bound of $2k+1$ and achieves a bound with an optimal multiplicative constant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in the Proceedings of the 33nd International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Quadratic-Time Algorithm for the Maximum-Weight $(k, \ell)$-Sparse Subgraph Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20882v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable. We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Contracts Get Complex: Information-Theoretic Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09794v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the combinatorial-action contract model (Dütting et al., FOCS'21) a principal delegates the execution of a complex project to an agent, who can choose any subset from a given set of actions. Each set of actions incurs a cost to the agent, given by a set function $c$, and induces an expected reward to the principal, given by a set function $f$. To incentivize the agent, the principal designs a contract that specifies the payment upon success, with the optimal contract being the one that maximizes the principal's utility. It is known that with access to value queries no constant-approximation is possible for submodular $f$ and additive $c$. A fundamental open problem is: does the problem become tractable with demand queries? We answer this question to the negative, by establishing that finding an optimal contract for submodular $f$ and additive $c$ requires exponentially many demand queries. We leverage the robustness of our techniques to extend and strengthen this result to different combinations of submodular/supermodular $f$ and $c$; while allowing the principal to access $f$ and $c$ using arbitrary communication protocols. Our results are driven by novel equal-revenue constructions when one of the functions is additive, immediately implying value query hardness. We then identify a new property -- sparse demand -- which allows us to strengthen these results to demand query hardness. Finally, by augmenting a perturbed version of these constructions with one additional action, thereby making both functions combinatorial, we establish exponential communication complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SODA 2026.

A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The design of MCNs is crucial for achieving high-performance space-based internet, yet presents a significant challenge due to the large scale and tightly coupled parameters of these systems, which result in a high-dimensional combinatorial optimization problem. To address this challenge, we propose the Structured Motif Lattice (SML) paradigm, which decomposes the MCN design space into two orthogonal dimensions: topological connectivity and geometric layout. This decomposition reduces the original high-dimensional problem to a tractable bi-dimensional. Under the SML paradigm, we formalize the High-Availability and Low-Latency MCN Design (HALLMD) problem and develop the Lattice and Motif Search (LAMS) algorithm to find near-optimal MCN configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the LAMS under the SML paradigm achieves substantially higher network availability and lower average traffic latency than the structures generated by current state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Algorithms for Finding Cliques in Random Intersection Graphs via Sum-of-Squares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20376v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study efficient algorithms for recovering cliques in dense random intersection graphs (RIGs). In this model, $d = n^{Ω(1)}$ cliques of size approximately $k$ are randomly planted by choosing the vertices to participate in each clique independently with probability $δ$. While there has been extensive work on recovering one, or multiple disjointly planted cliques in random graphs, the natural extension of this question to recovering overlapping cliques has been, surprisingly, largely unexplored. Moreover, because every vertex can be part of polynomially many cliques, this task is significantly harder than in case of disjointly planted cliques (as recently studied by Kothari, Vempala, Wein and Xu [COLT'23]) and manifests in the failure of simple combinatorial and even spectral algorithms. In this work we obtain the first efficient algorithms for recovering the community structure of RIGs both from the perspective of exact and approximate recovery. Our algorithms are further robust to noise, monotone adversaries, a certain, optimal number of edge corruptions, and work whenever $k \gg \sqrt{n \log(n)}$. Our techniques follow the proofs-to-algorithms framework utilizing the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our first result is a strong impossibility: For submodular reward functions, no randomized poly-time algorithm can approximate the optimal budget-feasible value within \textit{any finite factor}, even with demand-oracle access. This result rules out extending known constant-factor guarantees from either (i) unbudgeted settings with combinatorial actions or (ii) budgeted settings with binary actions, to their combination. The hardness is tight: It holds even when all but one agent have binary actions and the remaining agent has just one additional action. On the positive side, we show that gross substitutes rewards (a well-studied strict subclass of submodular functions) admit a deterministic poly-time $O(1)$-approximation, using only value queries. Our results thus draw the first sharp separation between budgeted and unbudgeted settings in combinatorial contracts, and identifies gross substitutes as a tractable frontier for budgeted combinatorial contracts. Finally, we present an FPTAS for additive rewards, demonstrating that arbitrary approximation is tractable under any budget. This constitutes the first FPTAS for the multi-agent combinatorial-actions setting, even in the absence of budget constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITCS 2026</p></details> |

Modern AI systems such as LLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns become especially crucial. Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by training on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode and perpetuate societal biases. While modifying training datasets and algorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing techniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in pre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve fairness. However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune presents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space, requiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the frontiers of model fairness and utility. To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program repair approach via randomized simulated annealing. Given the prohibitive evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states (active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics. This allows us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly searching through the LLM parameter space. This paper introduces Attention Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while minimally impacting overall model utility. Our experiments show that Attention Pruning achieves up to $40\%$ reduction in gender bias and outperforms the state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19364v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Tractability via Structure: Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Graph Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19573v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural models have shown promise in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes. We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone. We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overlap Analysis of the Shortest Path Problem: Local Search, Landscapes, and Franz--Parisi Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18666v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two directions in algorithms and complexity involve: (1) classifying which optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, and (2) understanding which computational problems are hard to solve \emph{on average} in addition to the worst case. For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms. Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \emph{Gibbs measures} and the \emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input. A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \emph{trees}, which is true. Using the Franz--Parisi potential, we explain an analogy with results from combinatorial optimization -- submodular minimization is tractable via local search on the Lovász extension, even though ``naive'' local search over sets or the multilinear extension provably fails.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract shortened for arxiv</p></details> |

We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).</p></details> |  |

Although foundational, the original analysis contains several inaccuracies, including a fundamental technical gap in the treatment of the underlying discrete process. We give a transparent and fully rigorous reconstruction of the KVV argument by reformulating the evolution of available neighbors as a discrete-time death process and deriving a sharp upper bound via a simple factor-revealing linear program that captures the correct recurrence structure. This yields a precise bound $\lceil n(1 - 1/e) + 2 - 1/e \rceil$ on the expected number of matched vertices, refining the classical claim $n(1 - 1/e) + o(n)$. Our goal is not to optimize this upper bound, but to provide a mathematically sound and conceptually clean correction of the classical KVV analysis, while remaining faithful to its original combinatorial framework.</p></details> |  |

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2026</p></details> |

Although it is based on a very simple propagation model, its decision version is NP-complete, and its optimization version is NP-hard. Many of its theoretical properties across different graph families have been thoroughly explored, and numerous interesting variants have been proposed. This paper reports novel mathematical programs for the optimization version of the classical GBP. Among the presented programs are a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), two Integer Linear Programs (ILP), and two Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Most optimization solvers can handle these, being QUBO problems of a capital interest in quantum computing. The primary aim of this paper is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GBP by examining its different formulations. Compared to other mathematical programs from the literature, the ones presented here are conceptually simpler and involve fewer variables. These make them more practical for finding optimal solutions using optimization algorithms and solvers, as we show by solving some instances with millions of vertices in just a few minutes.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.</p></details> |  |

Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the classes $Σ^p_2$ or $Σ^p_3$ from the polynomial hierarchy, almost no hardness results in this regime are currently known. However, such complexity insights are important, since they imply that no polynomial-sized integer program for these min-max problems exist, and hence conventional IP-based approaches fail. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new $Σ^p_2$-complete and $Σ^p_3$-complete problems. The majority of all earlier publications on $Σ^p_2$- and $Σ^p_3$-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Precisely, we introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). We show that for every single of these problems, the corresponding min-max (i.e. interdiction/regret) variant is $Σ^p_2$- and the min-max-min (i.e. two-stage) variant is $Σ^p_3$-complete.</p></details> |  |

These problems typically consider full knowledge about the input. In practical settings, however, uncertainty in the input data is a usual phenomenon, whereby this is normally not covered in optimization versions of NP problems. One concept to model the uncertainty in the input data, is recoverable robustness. The instance of the recoverable robust version of a combinatorial problem P is split into a base scenario $σ_0$ and an uncertainty scenario set $\textsf{S}$. The base scenario and all members of the uncertainty scenario set are instances of the original combinatorial problem P. The task is to calculate a solution $s_0$ for the base scenario $σ_0$ and solutions $s$ for all uncertainty scenarios $σ\in \textsf{S}$ such that $s_0$ and $s$ are not too far away from each other according to a distance measure, so $s_0$ can be easily adapted to $s$. This paper introduces Hamming Distance Recoverable Robustness, in which solutions $s_0$ and $s$ have to be calculated, such that $s_0$ and $s$ may only differ in at most $κ$ elements. We survey the complexity of Hamming distance recoverable robust versions of optimization problems, typically found in NP for different scenario encodings. The complexity is primarily situated in the lower levels of the polynomial hierarchy. The main contribution of the paper is a gadget reduction framework that shows that the recoverable robust versions of problems in a large class of combinatorial problems is $Σ^P_{3}$-complete. This class includes problems such as Vertex Cover, Coloring or Subset Sum. Additionally, we expand the results to $Σ^P_{2m+1}$-completeness for multi-stage recoverable robust problems with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ stages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Generalization of Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problems via Test-Time Projection Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02392v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data, rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.24627</p></details> |
| **[PepEVOLVE: Position-Aware Dynamic Peptide Optimization via Group-Relative Advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16912v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Algorithms and Implementations for Extracting Maximum-Size $(k,\ell)$-Sparse Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16877v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A multigraph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, \ell)$-sparse if every subset $X \subseteq V$ induces at most $\max\{k|X| - \ell, 0\}$ edges. Finding a maximum-size $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph is a classical problem in rigidity theory and combinatorial optimization, with known polynomial-time algorithms. This paper presents a highly efficient and flexible implementation of an augmenting path method, enhanced with a range of powerful practical heuristics that significantly reduce running time while preserving optimality. These heuristics $\unicode{x2013}$ including edge-ordering, node-ordering, two-phase strategies, and pseudoforest-based initialization $\unicode{x2013}$ steer the algorithm toward accepting more edges early in the execution and avoiding costly augmentations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates that our implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude. We also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for extracting an inclusion-wise maximal $(k,2k)$-sparse subgraph with the sparsity condition required only for node sets of size at least three, which is particularly relevant to 3D rigidity when $k = 3$. We provide a carefully engineered implementation, which is publicly available online and is proposed for inclusion in the LEMON graph library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Computing the Nucleolus: An Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16517v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Maggiorano et al. (2025) claimed that they have developed a strongly polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm for the nucleolus in convex games that is based on the reduced game approach and submodular function minimization method. Thereby, avoiding the ellipsoid method with its negative side effects in numerical computation completely. However, we shall argue that this is a fallacy based on an incorrect application of the Davis/Maschler reduced game property (RGP). Ignoring the fact that despite the pre-nucleolus, other solutions like the core, pre-kernel, and semi-reactive pre-bargaining set possess this property as well. This causes a severe selection issue, leading to the failure to compute the nucleolus of convex games using the reduced games approach. In order to assess this finding in its context, the ellipsoid method of Faigle et al. (2001) and the Fenchel-Moreau conjugation-based approach from convex analysis of Meinhardt (2013) to compute a pre-kernel element were resumed. In the latter case, it was exploited that for TU games with a single-valued pre-kernel, both solution concepts coincide. Implying that one has computed the pre-nucleolus if one has found the sole pre-kernel element of the game. Though it is a specialized and highly optimized algorithm for the pre-kernel, it assures runtime complexity of O(n^3) for computing the pre-nucleolus whenever the pre-kernel is a single point, which indicates a polynomial-time algorithm for this class of games.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[AgentSwift: Efficient LLM Agent Design via Value-guided Hierarchical Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06017v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across diverse domains, yet automated agent design remains a significant challenge. Current automated agent design approaches are often constrained by limited search spaces that primarily optimize workflows but fail to integrate crucial human-designed components like memory, planning, and tool use. Furthermore, these methods are hampered by high evaluation costs, as evaluating even a single new agent on a benchmark can require tens of dollars. The difficulty of this exploration is further exacerbated by inefficient search strategies that struggle to navigate the large design space effectively, making the discovery of novel agents a slow and resource-intensive process. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSwift, a novel framework for automated agent design. We formalize a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components. This structure moves beyond optimizing workflows alone by co-optimizing functional components, which enables the discovery of more complex and effective agent architectures. To make exploration within this expansive space feasible, we mitigate high evaluation costs by training a value model on a high-quality dataset, generated via a novel strategy combining combinatorial coverage and balanced Bayesian sampling for low-cost evaluation. Guiding the entire process is a hierarchical MCTS strategy, which is informed by uncertainty to efficiently navigate the search space. Evaluated across a comprehensive set of seven benchmarks spanning embodied, math, web, tool, and game domains, AgentSwift discovers agents that achieve an average performance gain of 8.34\% over both existing automated agent search methods and manually designed agents. Our framework serves as a launchpad for researchers to rapidly discover powerful agent architectures.</p></details> | AAAI-2026 |
| **[Non-Gaited Legged Locomotion with Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07508v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots are able to navigate complex terrains by continuously interacting with the environment through careful selection of contact sequences and timings. However, the combinatorial nature behind contact planning hinders the applicability of such optimization problems on hardware. In this work, we present a novel approach that optimizes gait sequences and respective timings for legged robots in the context of optimization-based controllers through the use of sampling-based methods and supervised learning techniques. We propose to bootstrap the search by learning an optimal value function in order to speed-up the gait planning procedure making it applicable in real-time. To validate our proposed method, we showcase its performance both in simulation and on hardware using a 22 kg electric quadruped robot. The method is assessed on different terrains, under external perturbations, and in comparison to a standard control approach where the gait sequence is fixed a priori.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoFa: A Unified Performance Modeling Framework for LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09837v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth in LLM scales, with parameters soaring from billions to trillions, has necessitated distributed pretraining across large clusters comprising thousands to tens of thousands of devices. While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Online Inventory Balancing to Inventory Shocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16044v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classic adversarial online resource allocation problems such as AdWords, customers arrive online while products are given offline with a fixed initial inventory. To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy "inventory balancing (IB)" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)." Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial "interval assignment problem" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version in the Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2025) conference; Journal version in Operations Research (major revision)</p></details> |
| **[PushingBots: Collaborative Pushing via Neural Accelerated Combinatorial Hybrid Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15995v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 24 figures.

| **[Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (FRIS) Enabling Secure Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15860v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).</p></details> |  |

We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\% and significantly improves code quality. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between generative AI and combinatorial optimization in software engineering, highlighting the critical importance of precise model formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version, full paper has been accepted in IEEE CASCON 2025 and will appear on lEEE Xplore</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Matroids: Base Packing and Covering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15460v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider dynamic matroids, where elements can be inserted to or deleted from the ground set over time. The independent sets change to reflect the current ground set. As matroids are central to the study of many combinatorial optimization problems, it is a natural next step to also consider them in a dynamic setting. The study of dynamic matroids has the potential to generalize several dynamic graph problems, including, but not limited to, arboricity and maximum bipartite matching. We contribute by providing efficient algorithms for some fundamental matroid questions. In particular, we study the most basic question of maintaining a base dynamically, providing an essential building block for future algorithms. We further utilize this result and consider the elementary problems of base packing and base covering. We provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base packing number $Φ$ in $O(Φ\cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Similarly, we provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $β$ in $O(β\cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Moreover, we give an algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $β$ in $O(\text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update against an oblivious adversary. These results are obtained by exploring the relationship between base collections, a generalization of tree-packings, and base packing and covering respectively. We provide structural theorems to formalize these connections, and show how they lead to simple dynamic algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a dry-to-wet framework combining generative modeling and experimental validation to optimize peptides targeting ATP5A, a potential peptide-binding protein for GBM. Our framework introduces the first lead-conditioned generative model, which focuses exploration on geometrically relevant regions around lead peptides and mitigates the combinatorial complexity of de novo methods. Specifically, we propose POTFlow, a \underline{P}rior and \underline{O}ptimal \underline{T}ransport-based \underline{Flow}-matching model for peptide optimization. POTFlow employs secondary structure information (e.g., helix, sheet, loop) as geometric constraints, which are further refined by optimal transport to produce shorter flow paths. With this design, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with five popular approaches. When applied to GBM, our method generates peptides that selectively inhibit cell viability and significantly prolong survival in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. As the first lead peptide-conditioned flow matching model, POTFlow holds strong potential as a generalizable framework for therapeutic peptide design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combinatorial Optimization using Comparison Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15142v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a linear combinatorial optimization problem, we are given a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ of feasible subsets of a ground set $U$ of $n$ elements, and aim to find $S^* = \arg\min_{S \in \mathcal{F}} \langle w, \mathbbm{1}_S \rangle$. Traditionally, the weight vector is given, or a value oracle allows evaluating $w(S) := \langle w, \mathbbm{1}_S \rangle$. Motivated by practical interest in pairwise comparisons, and by the theoretical quest to understand computational models, we study a weaker, more robust comparison oracle that for any $S, T \in \mathcal{F}$ reveals only whether $w(S) <, =, > w(T)$. We ask: when can we find $S^*$ using few comparison queries, and when can this be done efficiently? We present three contributions: (1) We establish that the query complexity over any set system $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ is $\tilde O(n^2)$, using the inference dimension framework, highlighting a separation between information and computational complexity (runtime may still be exponential for NP-hard problems under ETH). (2) We introduce a Global Subspace Learning (GSL) framework for objective functions with discrete integer weights bounded by $B$, giving an algorithm to sort all feasible sets using $O(nB \log(nB))$ queries, improving the $\tilde O(n^2)$ bound when $B = o(n)$. For linear matroids, algebraic techniques yield efficient algorithms for problems including $k$-SUM, SUBSET-SUM, and $A{+}B$ sorting. (3) We give the first polynomial-time, low-query algorithms for classic combinatorial problems: minimum cuts, minimum weight spanning trees (and matroid bases), bipartite matching (and matroid intersection), and shortest $s$-$t$ paths. Our work provides the first general query complexity bounds and efficient algorithms for this model, opening new directions for comparison-based optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient-Based Join Ordering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14482v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Task Offloading of Vehicular Edge Computing with Parallel Computation Queues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03935v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers a parallel task execution strategy in vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, where edge servers are deployed along the roadside to process offloaded computational tasks of vehicular users. To minimize the overall waiting delay among vehicular users, a novel task offloading solution is implemented based on the network cooperation balancing resource under-utilization and load congestion. Dual evaluation through theoretical and numerical ways shows that the developed solution achieves a globally optimal delay reduction performance compared to existing methods, which is also validated by the feasibility test over a real-map virtual environment. The in-depth analysis reveals that predicting the instantaneous processing power of edge servers facilitates the identification of overloaded servers, which is critical for determining network delay. By considering discrete variables of the queue, the proposed technique's precise estimation can effectively address these combinatorial challenges to achieve optimal performance.</p></details> |  |

While synthesis of such libraries has advanced since the 1960s and been accelerated by laboratory automation, their broader utility depends on rapid, quantitative measurements of composition-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning probe microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer unique potential for providing these functionally relevant, spatially resolved readouts. Here, we demonstrate a fully automated SPM framework for exploring ferroelectric properties across combinatorial libraries, focusing on binary Sm-doped BiFeO3 (SmBFO) and ternary Al$_{1-x-y}$Sc$_x$B$_y$N (Al,Sc,B)N systems. In SmBFO, automated exploration identifies the known morphotropic phase boundary with enhanced ferroelectric response and reveals a previously unreported double-peak fine structure. In the (Al,Sc,B)N library, ferroelectric behavior emerges at the phase-stability boundary, correlating with variations in morphology and defect concentration. By integrating automated SPM with wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and photoluminescence mapping, we resolve the composition-morphology-defect-property relationships underlying ferroelectric response and demonstrate a pathway toward a multi-tool, high-throughput characterization platform. Finally, we implement Gaussian-process-based single- and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to enable autonomous exploration, highlighting the Pareto front as a powerful framework for balancing competing physical rewards and accelerating data-driven physics discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Kissing Numbers with Game-theoretic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13391v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.</p></details> |  |

In some of these applications, ensuring the correctness of the solver's output is critical. However, the complexity of modern solvers makes them susceptible to bugs in their source code. In the domain of satisfiability checking (SAT), this issue has been addressed through proof logging, where the solver generates a formal proof of the correctness of its answer. For more expressive problems like MaxSAT, the optimization variant of SAT, proof logging had not seen a comparable breakthrough until recently. In this paper, we show how to achieve proof logging for state-of-the-art techniques in Branch-and-Bound MaxSAT solving. This includes certifying look-ahead methods used in such algorithms as well as advanced clausal encodings of pseudo-Boolean constraints based on so-called Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDDs). We implement these ideas in MaxCDCL, the dominant branch-and-bound solver, and experimentally demonstrate that proof logging is feasible with limited overhead, while proof checking remains a challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a paper that will be published in the proceedings of AAAI 2026.

IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer programming. We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP) optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on convex geometry and Carathéodory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Small to Large: A Graph Convolutional Network Approach for Solving Assortment Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10834v3)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assortment optimization seeks to select a subset of substitutable products, subject to constraints, to maximize expected revenue. The problem is NP-hard due to its combinatorial and nonlinear nature and arises frequently in industries such as e-commerce, where platforms must solve thousands of such problems each minute. We propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) framework to efficiently solve constrained assortment optimization problems. Our approach constructs a graph representation of the problem, trains a GCN to learn the mapping from problem parameters to optimal assortments, and develops three inference policies based on the GCN's output. Owing to the GCN's ability to generalize across instance sizes, patterns learned from small-scale samples can be transferred to large-scale problems. Numerical experiments show that a GCN trained on instances with 20 products achieves over 85% of the optimal revenue on problems with up to 2,000 products within seconds, outperforming existing heuristics in both accuracy and efficiency. We further extend the framework to settings with an unknown choice model using transaction data and demonstrate similar performance and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal version updated</p></details> |
| **[GRAPHTEXTACK: A Realistic Black-Box Node Injection Attack on LLM-Enhanced GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12423v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which combine structural and textual node information, are ubiquitous across many domains. Recent work integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to jointly model semantics and structure, resulting in more general and expressive models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on TAG benchmarks. However, this integration introduces dual vulnerabilities: GNNs are sensitive to structural perturbations, while LLM-derived features are vulnerable to prompt injection and adversarial phrasing. While existing adversarial attacks largely perturb structure or text independently, we find that uni-modal attacks cause only modest degradation in LLM-enhanced GNNs. Moreover, many existing attacks assume unrealistic capabilities, such as white-box access or direct modification of graph data. To address these gaps, we propose GRAPHTEXTACK, the first black-box, multi-modal{, poisoning} node injection attack for LLM-enhanced GNNs. GRAPHTEXTACK injects nodes with carefully crafted structure and semantics to degrade model performance, operating under a realistic threat model without relying on model internals or surrogate models. To navigate the combinatorial, non-differentiable search space of connectivity and feature assignments, GRAPHTEXTACK introduces a novel evolutionary optimization framework with a multi-objective fitness function that balances local prediction disruption and global graph influence. Extensive experiments on five datasets and two state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced GNN models show that GRAPHTEXTACK significantly outperforms 12 strong baselines.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

| **[Taylor Approximation Variance Reduction for Approximation Errors in PDE-constrained Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05723v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In numerous applications, surrogate models are used as a replacement for accurate parameter-to-observable mappings when solving large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Learning of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models through Stochastic Gradient Annealed Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06710v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted version of the Bayesian GPLVMs has been proposed to obtain a tighter variational bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this work, we propose an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach to address these issues. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient sequential Bayesian inference for state-space epidemic models using ensemble data assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05650v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating latent epidemic states and model parameters from partially observed, noisy data remains a major challenge in infectious disease modeling. State-space formulations provide a coherent probabilistic framework for such inference, yet fully Bayesian estimation is often computationally prohibitive because evaluating the observed-data likelihood requires integration over all latent trajectories. The Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$) algorithm offers a principled approach for joint state and parameter inference, combining an outer SMC sampler over parameters with an inner particle filter that estimates the likelihood up to the current time point. Despite its theoretical appeal, this nested particle filter imposes substantial computational cost, limiting routine use in near-real-time outbreak response. We propose Ensemble SMC$^2$ (eSMC$^2$), a scalable variant that replaces the inner particle filter with an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to approximate the incremental likelihood at each observation time. While this substitution introduces bias via a Gaussian approximation, we mitigate finite-sample effects using an unbiased Gaussian density estimator and adapt the EnKF for epidemic data through state-dependent observation variance. This makes our approach particularly suitable for overdispersed incidence data commonly encountered in infectious disease surveillance. Simulation experiments with known ground truth and an application to 2022 United States (U.S.) monkeypox incidence data demonstrate that eSMC$^2$ achieves substantial computational gains while producing posterior estimates comparable to SMC$^2$. The method accurately recovers latent epidemic trajectories and key epidemiological parameters, providing an efficient framework for sequential Bayesian inference from imperfect surveillance data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal novelty detection for replicate point patterns with FDR or FWER control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18195v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monte Carlo tests are widely used for computing valid p-values without requiring known distributions of test statistics. When performing multiple Monte Carlo tests, it is essential to maintain control of the type I error. Some techniques for multiplicity control pose requirements on the joint distribution of the p-values, for instance independence, which can be computationally intensive to achieve using naïve multiple Monte Carlo testing. We highlight in this work that multiple Monte Carlo testing is an instance of conformal novelty detection. Leveraging this insight enables a more efficient multiple Monte Carlo testing procedure, avoiding excessive simulations while still ensuring exact control over the false discovery rate or the family-wise error rate. We call this approach conformal multiple Monte Carlo testing. The performance is investigated in the context of global envelope tests for point pattern data through a simulation study and an application to a sweat gland data set. Results reveal that with a fixed number of simulations under the null hypothesis, our proposed method yields substantial improvements in power of the testing procedure as compared to the naïve multiple Monte Carlo testing procedure.</p></details> | Published |

We propose a novel, interpretable additive model tailored for such data, designed to deliver both high predictive accuracy and clear interpretability. The model features bivariate coefficient surfaces to represent relationships across panel dimensions, with sparsity introduced via penalized smoothing and group bridge regression. This enables simultaneous estimation of the surfaces and identification of significant inter-dimensional effects. Through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to Japanese subnational age-specific mortality rates, we demonstrate the proposed model's superior forecasting performance and interpretability compared to existing functional time series approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an earlier joint work, we studied a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on torus with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature, where we proved that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the inverse temperature. However, the analysis in that torus setting relied crucially on compactness and does not directly extend to unbounded domains. This work introduces a new approach that resolves this issue and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd. In particular, our main result shows that for double-well energy with equal well depths, the time complexity scales as seventh power of the inverse temperature, and quadratically in both the inverse allowed absolute error and probability error.</p></details> | <details><summary>relat...</summary><p>related to previous work arXiv:2508.02763</p></details> |

With the help of Large Language Models and their reasoning capabilities, existing systems are able to think and decompose an input question over multiple steps to analyze, retrieve, and reason. However, training-based approaches for this problem still suffer from LLM hallucinations and incorrect reasoning paths that hinder performance. Hence, we propose PATHFINDER, an approach that: (i) uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate training path traces, (ii) improves training data quality by filtering erroneous and lengthy traces using sub-answer recall and LLM-as-a-judge verification, and (iii) reformulates sub-queries to handle failed retrieval cases. By following these steps, we demonstrate that PATHFINDER improves the performance of multi-hop QA over public benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 5 PAGES, 3 IMAGES |

This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems. This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown. We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals. Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Athena: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Data-efficient Process Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09532v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based and Sample-Efficient AI-Assisted Math Discovery in Sphere Packing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04829v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational inference for approximate objective priors using neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02364v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Bayesian statistics, the choice of the prior can have an important influence on the posterior and the parameter estimation, especially when few data samples are available. To limit the added subjectivity from a priori information, one can use the framework of objective priors, more particularly, we focus on reference priors in this work. However, computing such priors is a difficult task in general. Hence, we consider cases where the reference prior simplifies to the Jeffreys prior. We develop in this paper a flexible algorithm based on variational inference which computes approximations of priors from a set of parametric distributions using neural networks. We also show that our algorithm can retrieve modified Jeffreys priors when constraints are specified in the optimization problem to ensure the solution is proper. We propose a simple method to recover a relevant approximation of the parametric posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods even if the density function of the parametric prior is not known in general. Numerical experiments on several statistical models of increasing complexity are presented. We show the usefulness of this approach by recovering the target distribution. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on both prior and posterior distributions, jointly using variational inference and MCMC sampling.</p></details> |  |

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide insights into plasma behavior, including turbulence and confinement, which are essential for optimizing fusion reactor performance. Transitioning to exascale simulations introduces significant challenges, with traditional file input/output (I/O) inefficiencies remaining a key bottleneck. This work advances BIT1, an electrostatic PIC MC code, by improving the particle mover with OpenMP task-based parallelism, integrating the openPMD streaming API, and enabling in-memory data streaming with ADIOS2's Sustainable Staging Transport (SST) engine to enhance I/O performance, computational efficiency, and system storage utilization. We employ profiling tools such as gprof, perf, IPM and Darshan, which provide insights into computation, communication, and I/O operations. We implement time-dependent data checkpointing with the openPMD API enabling seamless data movement and in-situ visualization for real-time analysis without interrupting the simulation. We demonstrate improvements in simulation runtime, data accessibility and real-time insights by comparing traditional file I/O with the ADIOS2 BP4 and SST backends. The proposed hybrid BIT1 openPMD SST enhancement introduces a new paradigm for real-time scientific discovery in plasma simulations, enabling faster insights and more efficient use of exascale computing resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications (IJHPCA) prepared in English, formatted in SAGE Publications (LaTeX) template and consists of 22 pages, which includes the main text, references, and figures</p></details> |

MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to the IFAC World Congress 2026</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating these transformations, progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, well-structured datasets. Existing HLS datasets focus primarily on resource estimation, lack paired C and HLS examples with testbenches, and cover only a narrow set of optimizations. We introduce HLStrans, the first benchmark-scale dataset for LLM-driven C-to-HLS synthesis. HLStrans contains over 124K paired C and HLS programs for real-world applications, with full testbenches and synthesis-based annotations of latency and resource usage. The dataset systematically captures five categories of transformations and is enriched by an automated augmentation pipeline combining LLMs, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Design Space Exploration (DSE). We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on HLStrans, demonstrating that retrieval and fine-tuning significantly improve success rates and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Quantum Circuit Cutting Framework for Sampling Overhead Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17704v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently developed quantum circuit cutting technique greatly extends the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, it introduces substantial overhead in both classical postprocessing and quantum resources, as the postprocessing complexity and sampling cost scale exponentially with the number of circuit cuts. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework, ShotQC, which effectively reduces the sampling overhead through two key optimizations: shot distribution and cut parameterization. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo strategy to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to the variance in the final outcome. The latter exploits additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. Integrating these optimizations, ShotQC significantly reduces the sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated across a range of benchmark circuits.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a novel policy optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by anticipating future observations, without requiring suboptimal approximations or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that efficiently estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing methods struggle to act under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Despite extensive development of compositional methods, a direct analogue of Moran's \(I\) for assessing spatial autocorrelation in areal compositional data has been lacking. We propose Reyes's \(I\), a Moran type statistic defined through the Aitchison inner product and norm, which is invariant to scale, to permutations of the parts, and to the choice of the \(\operatorname{ilr}\) contrast matrix. Under the randomization assumption, we derive an upper bound, the expected value, and the noncentral second moment, and we describe exact and Monte Carlo permutation procedures for inference. Through simulations covering identical, independent, and spatially correlated compositions under multiple covariance structures and neighborhood definitions, we show that Reyes's \(I\) provides stable behavior, competitive calibration, and improved efficiency relative to a naive alternative based on averaging componentwise Moran statistics. We illustrate practical utility by studying the spatial dependence of a composition measuring COVID-19 severity across Colombian departments during January 2021, documenting significant positive autocorrelation early in the month that attenuates over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 10 figures, 0 tables</p></details> |
| **[Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acceleration of Parallel Tempering for Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03825v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are algorithms used to sample probability distributions, commonly used to sample the Boltzmann distribution of physical/chemical models (e.g., protein folding, Ising model, etc.). This allows us to study their properties by sampling the most probable states of those systems. However, the sampling capabilities of these methods are not sufficiently accurate when handling complex configuration spaces. This has resulted in the development of new techniques that improve sampling accuracy, usually at the expense of increasing the computational cost. One of such techniques is Parallel Tempering which improves accuracy by running several replicas which periodically exchange their states. Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The results show a maximum speed-up of 52x using OpenMP with 48 cores, and of 986x speed-up with the CUDA version. Furthermore, the results serve as a basic benchmark to compare a future quantum implementation of the same algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures (5 of them composed by 2 subfigures)</p></details> |
| **[Using functional information for binary classifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03761v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adequate use of information measured in a continuous manner along a period of time represents a methodological challenge. In the last decades, most of traditional statistical procedures have been extended for accommodating these functional data. The binary classification problem, which aims to correctly identify units as positive or negative based on marker values, is not aside of this scenario. The crucial point for making binary classifications based on a marker is to establish an order in the marker values, which is not immediate when these values are presented as functions. Here, we argue that if the marker is related to the characteristic under study, a trajectory from a positive participant should be more similar to trajectories from the positive population than to those drawn from the negative. With this criterion, a classification procedure based on the distance between the involved functions is proposed. Besides, we propose a fully non-parametric estimator for this so-called probability-based criterion, PBC. We explore its asymptotic properties, and its finite-sample behavior from an extensive Monte Carlo study. The observed results suggest that the proposed methodology works adequately, and frequently better than its competitors, for a wide variety of situations when the sample size in both the training and the testing cohorts is adequate. The practical use of the proposal is illustrated from real-world dataset. As online supplementary material, the manuscript includes a document with further simulations and additional comments. An R function which wraps up the implemented routines is also provided.</p></details> |  |

Our approach avoids Metropolis correction by coupling Markov chains at different discretization levels in a multilevel Monte Carlo approach. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed estimator is unbiased, attains finite variance, and satisfies a central limit theorem. It can achieve accuracy $ε>0$ for estimating expectations of Lipschitz functions in $d$ dimensions with $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}ε^{-2})$ expected gradient evaluations, without assuming warm start. We exhibit similar bounds using both approximate and stochastic gradients, and our method's computational cost is shown to scale independently of the size of the dataset. The proposed method is tested using a multinomial regression problem on the MNIST dataset and a Poisson regression model for soccer scores. Experiments indicate that the number of gradient evaluations per effective sample is independent of dimension, even when using inexact gradients. For product distributions, we give dimension-independent variance bounds. Our results demonstrate that in large-scale applications, the unbiased algorithm we present can be 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient than the ``gold-standard" randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</p></details> | <details><summary>101 P...</summary><p>101 Pages, 11 Figures</p></details> |

| **[Jupiter: Enhancing LLM Data Analysis Capabilities via Notebook and Inference-Time Value-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09245v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks. To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality, tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench, respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks. Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

| **[Markov Chains Approximate Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02384v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have long been observed to obtain near-optimal performance in various Bayesian inference settings. However, developing a supporting theory that makes these studies rigorous has proved challenging. In this paper, we study the classical spiked Wigner inference problem, where one aims to recover a planted Boolean spike from a noisy matrix measurement. We relate the recovery performance of Glauber dynamics on the annealed posterior to the performance of Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is known to achieve Bayes-optimal performance. Our main results rely on the analysis of an auxiliary Markov chain called restricted Gaussian dynamics (RGD). Concretely, we establish the following results: 1. RGD can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional recursion which mirrors the evolution of the AMP iterates. 2. From a warm start, RGD rapidly converges to a fixed point in correlation space, which recovers Bayes-optimal performance when run on the posterior. 3. Conditioned on widely believed mixing results for the SK model, we recover the phase transition for non-trivial inference.</p></details> | 41 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Monte Carlo-Type Neural Operator for Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05620v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient-free optimization via integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00888v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop and analyse an approach to optimize functions $l\colon \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ not assumed to be convex, differentiable or even continuous. The algorithm belongs to the class of model-based search methods. The idea is to fit recursively $l$ to a parametric family of distributions, using a Bayesian update followed by a reprojection back onto the chosen family. Remarkably, reprojection in our scenario boils down to computing expectations, which can be simply approximated through Monte Carlo. We show that when the family of distributions is appropriately chosen this approach can be interpreted as an implicit time-inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithm on a sequence of smoothed approximations of $l$, providing a route to establishing convergence. We establish new results for generic inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithms, which we specialise to the model-based search algorithm in the Gaussian scenario. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm on a challenging classification task in machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Sampling with Transferable Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18175v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Parallelizing MCMC Across the Sequence Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18413v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are foundational algorithms for Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling. However, most MCMC algorithms are inherently sequential and their time complexity scales linearly with the sequence length. Previous work on adapting MCMC to modern hardware has therefore focused on running many independent chains in parallel. Here, we take an alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in parallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for parallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence as a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a parallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to parallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the simulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of parallel Newton iterations. Additionally, we develop two new parallel quasi-Newton methods to evaluate nonlinear recursions with lower memory costs and reduced runtime. We find that the proposed parallel algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling across multiple examples, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude compared to sequential evaluation.</p></details> | 36 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Optimised Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12057v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) samplers are special cases of SMC samplers where the sequence of distributions can be embedded in a smooth path of distributions. Using this underlying path and a performance model based on the variance of the normalising constant estimator, we systematically study dense-schedule limits. From our theory emerges a notion of global barrier, capturing the inherent complexity of normalising constant approximation under our performance model. We then turn the resulting approximations into surrogate objective functions of algorithm performance, using them to guide method development. This leads to novel adaptive methods, Optimised Annealed SMC (OASMC), which address practical difficulties inherent in previous adaptive SMC methods. First, our OASMC algorithms are predictable: they produce a sequence of increasingly precise estimates at deterministic, known times. Second, Optimised Annealed Importance Sampling (OAIS), a special case of OASMC, enables schedule adaptation at a memory cost constant in the number of particles, requiring significantly less communication. Finally, these characteristics make OAIS highly efficient on GPUs. We provide an open-source, high-performance GPU implementation of our method and demonstrate up to a hundred-fold speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art adaptive AIS methods.</p></details> | 88 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Learning to Integrate Diffusion ODEs by Averaging the Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14502v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses. The target of secant losses is the same as that of diffusion models, or the diffusion model itself, leading to great training stability. By fine-tuning or distillation, the secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$.

| **[Jackknife Empirical Likelihood Method for U Statistics Based on Multivariate Samples and its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14038v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a jackknife empirical likelihood (JEL) framework for inference on parameters defined through multivariate three-sample U-statistic. From three independent multivariate samples, we construct JEL ratio statistic based on suitable jackknife pseudo-values and, under mild regularity conditions, establish a Wilks-type result showing that the log JEL ratio converges in distribution to a chi-square limit. This provides asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the parameter of interest without explicit variance estimation or heavy resampling. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method, we construct confidence intervals for differences in volume under the surface (VUS) measures, which are widely used in classification problems. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the performance of JEL-based confidence intervals with those obtained from normal approximation of U-statistic and kernel-based methods. The findings indicate that the proposed JEL approach outperforms existing methods in terms of coverage probability and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to a recent real dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.</p></details> |  |

We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances SHM toward trustworthy digital twin deployment and risk-aware structural diagnostics.</p></details> | 37 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Generative diffusion for perceptron problems: statistical physics analysis and efficient algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16292v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $α= M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $κ$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $α$-$κ$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 mi...</summary><p>v3 minor revision after NeurIPS's rebuttal</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: a...</summary><p>v2: additional experiments and results included, typo corrected. v3: inference experiments redone, all results updated, conclusions remain qualitatively the same</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the VMC optimization part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through VMC, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Corners are essential low-level features in event-driven computer vision, and novel algorithms utilizing event-based representations, such as Threshold-Ordinal Surface (TOS), have been developed for corner detection. However, the implementation of these algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by significant latency, undermining the advantages of EBCs. To address this challenge, a near-memory architecture for efficient TOS updates (NM-TOS) is proposed. This architecture employs a read-write decoupled 8T SRAM cell and optimizes patch update speed through pipelining. Hardware-software co-optimized peripheral circuits and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) enable power and latency reductions. Compared to traditional digital implementations, our architecture reduces latency/energy by 24.7x/1.2x at Vdd = 1.2 V or 1.93x/6.6x at Vdd = 0.6 V based on 65nm CMOS process. Monte Carlo simulations confirm robust circuit operation, demonstrating zero bit error rate at operating voltages above 0.62 V, with only 0.2% at 0.61 V and 2.5% at 0.6 V. Corner detection evaluation using precision-recall area under curve (AUC) metrics reveals minor AUC reductions of 0.027 and 0.015 at 0.6 V for two popular EBC datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks. Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding.To address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data. Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tight Bounds for Feedback Vertex Set Parameterized by Clique-width](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01900v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new notion of acyclicity representation in labeled graphs, and present three applications thereof. Our main result is an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(6^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. We achieve this through an involved subroutine for merging partial solutions at union nodes in the expression. In the usual way this results in a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm for solving the decision problem in the same time. We complement these by a matching lower bound under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). This closes an open question that appeared multiple times in the literature [ESA 23, ICALP 24, IPEC 25]. We also present an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a tree decomposition of width $k$ of $G$, in time $O(3^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. This matches the known SETH-tight bound for the decision version, which was obtained using the celebrated cut-and-count technique [FOCS 11, TALG 22]. Unlike other applications of cut-and-count, which use the isolation lemma to reduce a decision problem to counting solutions modulo $2$, this bound was obtained via counting other objects, leaving the complexity of counting solutions modulo $2$ open. Finally, we present a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(18^kn^c)$ decides the existence of a connected feedback vertex set of size $b$ in $G$. We provide a matching lower bound under SETH.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.</p></details> | 5 pages + 6 SM |

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[USV: Unified Sparsification for Accelerating Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05754v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of high-fidelity video diffusion models (VDMs) is constrained by two key sources of redundancy: the quadratic complexity of global spatio-temporal attention and the computational overhead of long iterative denoising trajectories. Existing accelerators -- such as sparse attention and step-distilled samplers -- typically target a single dimension in isolation and quickly encounter diminishing returns, as the remaining bottlenecks become dominant. In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Our results highlight unified, dynamic sparsification as a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further internal evaluation, we found that the current version does not adequately represent the clarity and completeness that we intend for this work.

While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).

| **[Balanced Few-Shot Episodic Learning for Accurate Retinal Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04967v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizable Abstractions: Near-Optimal Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04958v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main focus of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is studying how large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be more efficiently solved when addressed in a modular way, by combining partial solutions computed for smaller subtasks. Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Optimal Experiment Design in Linear non-Gaussian Cyclic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21423v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.</p></details> |  |

Stable Isotope Ratio Analysis (SIRA), combined with Gaussian process regression-based isoscapes, has emerged as a powerful tool for geographic origin verification. While these models are now actively deployed in operational settings supporting regulators, certification bodies, and companies, they remain constrained by data scarcity and suboptimal dataset selection. In this work, we introduce a novel deployed data valuation framework designed to enhance the selection and utilization of training data for machine learning models applied in SIRA. By quantifying the marginal utility of individual samples using Shapley values, our method guides strategic, cost-effective, and robust sampling campaigns within active monitoring programs. By prioritizing high-informative samples, our approach improves model robustness and predictive accuracy across diverse datasets and geographies. Our framework has been implemented and validated in a live provenance verification system currently used by enforcement agencies, demonstrating tangible, real-world impact. Through extensive experiments and deployment in a live provenance verification system, we show that this system significantly enhances provenance verification, mitigates fraudulent trade practices, and strengthens regulatory enforcement of global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2026</p></details> |

Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.</p></details> |  |

Traditional codecs struggle below 1 kbps, while existing semantic approaches (STT-TTS) sacrifice prosody and speaker identity. We present STCTS, a generative semantic compression framework enabling natural voice communication at 80 bps. STCTS explicitly decomposes speech into linguistic content, prosodic expression, and speaker timbre, applying tailored compression: context-aware text encoding (70 bps), sparse prosody transmission via TTS interpolation (<14 bps at 0.1-1 Hz), and amortized speaker embedding. Evaluations on LibriSpeech demonstrate a 75x bitrate reduction versus Opus (6 kbps) and 12x versus EnCodec (1 kbps), while maintaining perceptual quality (NISQA MOS > 4.26), graceful degradation under packet loss and noise resilience. We also discover a bimodal quality distribution with prosody sampling rate: sparse and dense updates both achieve high quality, while mid-range rates degrade due to perceptual discontinuities--guiding optimal configuration design. Beyond efficiency, our modular architecture supports privacy-preserving encryption, human-interpretable transmission, and flexible deployment on edge devices, offering a robust solution for ultra-low bandwidth scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The complete source code and online speech reconstruction demo is publicly available at https://github.com/dywsy21/STCTS</p></details> |

Drawing on the Health Belief Model (HBM), this study examined belief-based predictors of intention to use GAI and therapists across two populations: a university sample (N = 1,155) and a nationally representative adult sample (N = 651). Using repeated-measures ANOVA and LASSO regression, we found that therapists were consistently valued for emotional, relational, and personalization benefits, while GAI was favored for accessibility and affordability. Yet structural advantages alone did not predict adoption; emotional benefit and personalization emerged as decisive factors. Adoption patterns diverged across groups: students treated GAI as a complement, whereas national adults approached it as a substitute. Concerns about privacy and reliability constrained GAI use in both groups. These findings extend HBM to multi-modality contexts and highlight design implications for trustworthy, emotionally resonant digital mental health tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurfFill: Completion of LiDAR Point Clouds via Gaussian Surfel Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03010v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lfranke.github.io/surffill</p></details> |
| **[Glance: Accelerating Diffusion Models with 1 Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02899v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.</p></details> |  |

Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11 healthy volunteers on 3T scanners using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern, leading to 14-second acquisition time and an acceleration factor of R=25. Zero-shot reconstruction was compared with parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP (338s, R=3) and compressed sensing reconstruction. For two volunteers, breath-hold scans (40s, R=6) were additionally acquired and retrospectively undersampled to R=25 to compute peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). To address long zero-shot training time, the n+m full stages of the zero-shot learning were divided into two parts to reduce backpropagation depth during training: 1) n frozen stages initialized with n-stage pretrained network and 2) m trainable stages initialized either randomly or m-stage pretrained network. Efficiency of our approach was assessed by varying initialization strategies and the number of trainable stages using the retrospectively undersampled data. Zero-shot reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality over compressed sensing, particularly in SNR and ductal delineation, and achieved image quality comparable to that of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing patterns. Improved initializations enhanced PSNR and reduced reconstruction time. Adjusting frozen/trainable configurations demonstrated that PSNR decreased only slightly from 38.25 dB (0/13) to 37.67 dB (12/1), while training time decreased up to 6.7-fold. Zero-shot learning delivers high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and the proposed partially trainable approach offers a practical solution for translation into time-constrained clinical workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, 2 tabels</p></details> |

This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.</p></details> |  |

SVEMnet wraps elastic-net and relaxed elastic-net models for Gaussian and binomial responses from glmnet in a fractional random-weight (FRW) resampling scheme with anti-correlated train/validation weights; penalties are selected by validation-weighted AIC- and BIC-type criteria, and predictions are averaged across replicates to stabilize fits near the interpolation boundary. In addition to the core SVEM engine, the package provides deterministic high-order formula expansion, a permutation-based whole-model test heuristic, and a mixture-constrained random-search optimizer that combines Derringer-Suich desirability functions, bootstrap-based uncertainty summaries, and optional mean-level specification-limit probabilities to generate scored candidate tables and diverse exploitation and exploration medoids for sequential fit-score-run-refit workflows. A simulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation study illustrates these tools in a small-sample mixture-process DOE setting, and simulation experiments based on sparse quadratic response surfaces benchmark SVEMnet against repeated cross-validated elastic-net baselines.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in enhancing the effectiveness of MIAs across diverse settings, defense strategies have lagged behind, struggling to balance model utility with robustness against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In this work, we propose the ideal inversion error to measure the privacy leakage, and our theoretical and empirical investigations reveals that higher-rank features are inherently more prone to privacy leakage. Motivated by this insight, we propose a lightweight and effective defense strategy based on low-rank feature filtering, which explicitly reduces the attack surface by constraining the dimension of intermediate representations. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing defenses, achieving state-of-the-art performance against a wide range of MIAs. Notably, our approach remains effective even in challenging regimes involving high-resolution data and high-capacity models, where prior defenses fail to provide adequate protection.

In large-scale scenarios such as search and rescue or environmental monitoring, traditional uniform coverage fails to account for varying regional priorities. DPC leverages a pre-constructed reference distribution to allocate agents' coverage efforts, spending more time in high-priority or densely sampled regions. We analyze convergence conditions using the Wasserstein distance, derive an analytic optimal control law for unconstrained cases, and propose a numerical method for constrained scenarios. Simulations on first-order dynamics and linearized quadrotor models demonstrate that DPC achieves trajectories closely matching the non-uniform reference distribution, outperforming existing coverage methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ASME JDSMC</p></details> |

However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on multimodal datasets with up to 15 modalities demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of additional modalities for selected samples compared with methods relying solely on unimodal information, entropy-based guidance, or random selection. We showcase the real-world relevance and scalability of our method by demonstrating its ability to effectively guide the costly acquisition of proteomics data for disease prediction in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank (UKBB). Our work provides an effective approach for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling more effective use of resources in constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore alternative sampling and evaluation strategies for preference inference in RLHF, drawing inspiration from areas such as game theory, statistics, and social choice theory. Our best-performing method, Swiss InfoGain, employs a Swiss tournament system with a proxy mutual-information-gain pairing rule, which significantly outperforms all other methods in constrained annotation budgets while also being more sample-efficient. Even in high-resource settings, we can identify superior alternatives to the Bradley-Terry baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive, resource-aware strategies reduce redundancy, enhance robustness, and yield statistically significant improvements in preference learning, highlighting the importance of balancing alignment quality with human workload in RLHF pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 6 algorithms.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter, LoRA) for large pre-trained models suffer from insufficient fitting ability and source-domain knowledge interference. In this paper, we propose Resource-Efficient Dual-Mask Training Framework (RDTF), a dedicated solution for multi-frame ASG task under resource constraints. We argue that training a compact model from scratch with million-level samples outperforms PEFT on large models, with RDTF realizing this via three core designs: 1) a Discrete Frame Generation Network (DFGN) optimized for low-frame-rate ASG, ensuring parameter efficiency; 2) a dual-mask based data utilization strategy to enhance the availability and diversity of limited data; 3) a difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method that decomposes sample entropy into static and adaptive components, enabling easy-to-difficult training convergence. To provide high-quality data support for RDTFs training from scratch, we construct VSD2M-a million-level multi-modal animated sticker dataset with rich annotations (static and animated stickers, action-focused text descriptions)-filling the gap of dedicated animated data for ASG task. Experiments demonstrate that RDTF is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to state-of-the-art PEFT methods (e.g., I2V-Adapter, SimDA) on ASG tasks, verifying the feasibility of our framework under resource constraints.</p></details> | Submitted to TMM |
| **[Reconstructing Multi-Scale Physical Fields from Extremely Sparse Measurements with an Autoencoder-Diffusion Cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01572v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,10 figures |
| **[LEC: Linear Expectation Constraints for False-Discovery Control in Selective Prediction and Routing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01556v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.</p></details> |  |

Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation.

| **[Agreement-Constrained Probabilistic Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01316v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding generates high-quality translations by maximizing the expected utility of output candidates, but it evaluates all pairwise scores over the candidate set; hence, it takes quadratic time with respect to the number of candidates. To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix. Our AC-PMBR decoding improved approximation errors of matrix completion by up to 3 times and achieved higher translation quality compared with PMBR decoding at a comparable computational cost on the WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$De translation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNL...</summary><p>IJCNLP-AACL 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Approximation Gap of Partial AUC Optimization: A Tale of Two Formulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01213v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Inverse Problem Solving Made Easy by Text-to-Image Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00557v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers blind inverse image restoration, the task of predicting a target image from a degraded source when the degradation (i.e. the forward operator) is unknown. Existing solutions typically rely on restrictive assumptions such as operator linearity, curated training data or narrow image distributions limiting their practicality. We introduce LADiBI, a training-free method leveraging large-scale text-to-image diffusion to solve diverse blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. Within a Bayesian framework, LADiBI uses text prompts to jointly encode priors for both target images and operators, unlocking unprecedented flexibility compared to existing methods. Additionally, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling algorithm that combines strategic operator initialization with iterative refinement of image and operator parameters, eliminating the need for highly constrained operator forms. Experiments show that LADiBI effectively handles both linear and challenging nonlinear image restoration problems across various image distributions, all without task-specific assumptions or retraining.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing research is constrained by two major challenges: native 3D models lack generalization due to data scarcity, while introducing 2D pre-trained knowledge often leads to inconsistent segmentation results across different views. To address these challenges, we propose S2AM3D, which incorporates 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision. We design a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning, producing globally consistent point features. A scale-aware prompt decoder is then proposed to enable real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals. Simultaneously, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with more than 100k samples, providing ample supervision signals for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2AM3D achieves leading performance across multiple evaluation settings, exhibiting exceptional robustness and controllability when handling complex structures and parts with significant size variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age Optimal Sampling and Routing under Intermittent Links and Energy Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00985v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Links in practical systems, such as satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, exhibit distinct delay distributions, intermittent availability, and heterogeneous energy costs. These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, nonlinear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state-action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-ReaVI, to solve this problem. We reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) the optimal routing policy is a monotonic handover policy that adapts to the availability of routes and their mean delays; and (ii) the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy, with at most "N choose 2 + N" breakpoints given N routes. Numerical experiments in a satellite-terrestrial integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance, or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Multi-rater Medical Image Segmentation for Diversity and Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00748v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is inherently influenced by data uncertainty, arising from ambiguous boundaries in medical scans and inter-observer variability in diagnosis. To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized. Code can be found in https://github.com/AI4MOL/ProSeg.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Function-Family Structure in Analog Circuit Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00712v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog circuit optimization is typically framed as black-box search over arbitrary smooth functions, yet device physics constrains performance mappings to structured families: exponential device laws, rational transfer functions, and regime-dependent dynamics. Off-the-shelf Gaussian-process surrogates impose globally smooth, stationary priors that are misaligned with these regime-switching primitives and can severely misfit highly nonlinear circuits at realistic sample sizes (50--100 evaluations). We demonstrate that pre-trained tabular models encoding these primitives enable reliable optimization without per-circuit engineering. Circuit Prior Network (CPN) combines a tabular foundation model (TabPFN v2) with Direct Expected Improvement (DEI), computing expected improvement exactly under discrete posteriors rather than Gaussian approximations. Across 6 circuits and 25 baselines, structure-matched priors achieve $R^2 \approx 0.99$ in small-sample regimes where GP-Matérn attains only $R^2 = 0.16$ on Bandgap, deliver $1.05$--$3.81\times$ higher FoM with $3.34$--$11.89\times$ fewer iterations, and suggest a shift from hand-crafting models as priors toward systematic physics-informed structure identification. Our code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEOAT: Personalization-Guided Evolutionary Question Assembly for One-Shot Adaptive Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00439v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has attracted increasing attention by integrating educational psychology with deep learning technologies. Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.</p></details> | AAAI-2026, 9 pages |
| **[Efficient and Programmable Exploration of Synthesizable Chemical Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00384v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Dynamical System Representations for Physiological Time-Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00239v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of self-supervised learning (SSL) for physiological time series depends on the ability of a pretraining objective to preserve information about the underlying physiological state while filtering out unrelated noise. However, existing strategies are limited due to reliance on heuristic principles or poorly constrained generative tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Execution of Bayesian Neural Networks using a Single Probabilistic Forward Pass and Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23440v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Communication-Computation Pipeline Parallel Split Learning over Wireless Edge Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23167v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Split learning (SL) offloads main computing tasks from multiple resource-constrained user equippments (UEs) to the base station (BS), while preserving local data privacy. However, its computation and communication processes remain sequential, resulting in limited system efficiency. To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that C$^2$P$^2$SL significantly reduces system training time by over 38\% while maintaining convergence accuracy under different communication conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx. Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit. Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Image Beyond Visual Aspect: Image Emotion Classification via Multiple-Affective Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23115v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraining dark matter halo profiles with symbolic regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23073v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer not only a means to synthesize and augment neural signals, but also a promising way for learning meaningful representations directly from raw data, a dual capability that remains largely unexplored in EEG research. In this study, we introduce a scalable GAN-based framework for resting-state EEG that serves this dual role: 1) synthesis and 2) unsupervised feature extraction. The generated time series closely replicate key statistical and spectral properties of real EEG, as validated through both visual and quantitative evaluations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the model's learned representations can be repurposed for a downstream gender classification task, achieving higher out-of-sample accuracy than models trained directly on EEG signals and performing comparably to recent EEG foundation models, while using significantly less data and computational resources. These findings highlight the potential of generative models to serve as both neural signal generators and unsupervised feature extractors, paving the way for more data-efficient, architecture-driven approaches to EEG analysis with reduced reliance on manual feature engineering.

Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation, conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts, and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system designed to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a novel two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling "what is generated" (content-specific flaws) from "how it is generated" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new and robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

Many prior methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics, widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In this paper, we present the RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net), a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces. Overall, our framework learns the task-relevant physical properties offline during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at run time.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, accepted to Robotic Computing & Communication</p></details> |

Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI26 conference main technical track</p></details> |

Images acquired at high spatial resolution or requiring fitting multiple parameters often require lengthy processing time, constraining their use in routine pipelines and slowing methodological innovation and clinical translation. We present GACELLE, an open source, GPU-accelerated framework for high-throughput qMRI analysis. GACELLE provides a stochastic gradient descent optimiser and a stochastic sampler in MATLAB, enabling fast parameter mapping, improved estimation robustness via spatial regularisation, and uncertainty quantification. GACELLE prioritises accessibility: users only need to provide a forward signal model, while GACELLE's backend manages computational parallelisation, automatic parameter updates, and memory-batching. The stochastic solver performs fully vectorised Markov chain Monte Carlo with identical likelihood on CPU and GPU, ensuring reproducibility across hardware. Benchmarking demonstrates up to 451-fold acceleration for the stochastic gradient descent solver and 14,380-fold acceleration for stochastic sampling compared to CPU-based estimation, without compromising accuracy. We demonstrated GACELLE's versatility on three representative qMRI models and on an image reconstruction task. Across these applications, GACELLE improves parameter precision, enhances test-retest reproducibility, and reduces noise in quantitative maps. By combining speed, usability and flexibility, GACELLE provides a generalisable optimisation framework for medical image analysis. It lowers the computational barrier for qMRI, paving the way for reproducible biomarker development, large-scale imaging studies, and clinical translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Stochastic Dynamics from Non-Sequential Data (DyNoSeD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17690v4)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring stochastic dynamics from data is central across the sciences, yet in many applications only unordered, non-sequential measurements are available-often restricted to limited regions of state space-so standard time-series methods do not apply. We introduce DyNoSeD, a first-principles framework that identifies unknown dynamical parameters from such non-sequential data by minimizing Fokker-Planck residuals. We develop two complementary routes: a local route that handles region-restricted data via locally estimated scores, and a global route that fits dynamics from globally sampled data using a kernel Stein discrepancy without explicit density or score estimation. When the dynamics are affine in the unknown parameters, we prove a necessary-and-sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the inferred parameters and derive a sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters are tightly constrained by the data and which remain effectively free under over-parameterization. For general non-affine case, both routes define differentiable losses amenable to gradient-based optimization. As demonstrations, we recover (i) the three parameters of a stochastic Lorenz system from non-sequential data (region-restricted data for the local route and full steady-state data for the global route) and (ii) a 3x7interaction matrix of a nonlinear gene-regulatory network derived from a published B-cell differentiation model, using only unordered steady-state samples and applying the global route. Finally, we show that the same Fokker-Planck residual viewpoint supports a "dynamics-to-density" complement that trains a normalized density estimator directly from known dynamics without any observations. Overall, IDyNSD provides two first-principles routes for system-identification from non-sequential data, grounded in the Fokker-Planck equation, that link data, density, and stochastic dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, 3DGS-SLAM algorithms remain impractical for mobile platforms due to their high computational cost, especially for their tracking process. This work introduces Splatonic, a sparse and efficient real-time 3DGS-SLAM algorithm-hardware co-design for resource-constrained devices. Inspired by classical SLAMs, we propose an adaptive sparse pixel sampling algorithm that reduces the number of rendered pixels by up to 256$\times$ while retaining accuracy. To unlock this performance potential on mobile GPUs, we design a novel pixel-based rendering pipeline that improves hardware utilization via Gaussian-parallel rendering and preemptive $α$-checking. Together, these optimizations yield up to 121.7$\times$ speedup on the bottleneck stages and 14.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup on off-the-shelf GPUs. To further address new bottlenecks introduced by our rendering pipeline, we propose a pipelined architecture that simplifies the overall design while addressing newly emerged bottlenecks in projection and aggregation. Evaluated across four 3DGS-SLAM algorithms, Splatonic achieves up to 274.9$\times$ speedup and 4738.5$\times$ energy savings over mobile GPUs and up to 25.2$\times$ speedup and 241.1$\times$ energy savings over state-of-the-art accelerators, all with comparable accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas. This study underscores the importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement in generative modeling for DEM generation, offering a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to conventional methods while emphasizing the challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, accepted at IGARSS 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19104v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves finetuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pretrained diffusion models together, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to each pretrained model. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively.

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

We address this by nitegrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. To mimic constrained-data scenarios, we evaluate our approach on ImageNet-1K pre-training and ADE20K fine-tuning using randomly sampled subsets of each dataset. Under this setting, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4%, and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Their design involves a high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial fusion due to their inherent resilience to current driven disruptions. Here, we release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes, paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single objective geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3) a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to the grid.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowerDance: MeanFlow for Efficient and Refined 3D Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21029v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Constrained Flow Matching: Sampling Generative Models with Hard Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04171v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs, including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method provides a flexible framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where constraint satisfaction is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Comparative studies consistently find that no single ICVI outperforms others across datasets, leaving practitioners without principled ICVI selection. We argue that inconsistent ICVI performance arises because studies evaluate them based on matching human labels rather than measuring the quality of the discovered structure in the data, using datasets without formally quantifying the structure type and quality. Structure type refers to the mathematical organisation in data that clustering aims to discover. Validity theory requires a theoretical definition of clustering quality, which depends on structure type. We demonstrate this through the first validity assessment of clustering quality measures for correlation patterns, a structure type that arises from clustering time series by correlation relationships. We formalise 23 canonical correlation patterns as the theoretical optimal clustering and use synthetic data modelling this structure with controlled perturbations to evaluate validity across content, criterion, construct, and external validity. Our findings show that Silhouette Width Criterion (SWC) and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) are valid for correlation patterns, whilst Calinski-Harabasz (VRC) and Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik (PBM) indices fail. Simple Lp norm distances achieve validity, whilst correlation-specific functions fail structural, criterion, and external validity. These results differ from previous studies where VRC and PBM performed well, demonstrating that validity depends on structure type. Our structure-type-specific validation method provides both practical guidance (quality thresholds SWC>0.9, DBI<0.15) and a methodological template for establishing validity for other structure types.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (51 total), 10 figs. v2: Reframed using validity theory - only valid ICVIs/DFs ranked.

Liu, J. Comp. Phys., 228(19), 2009]. The method enforces the divergence-free constraint implicitly, removing velocity--pressure compatibility conditions and eliminating pressure boundary layers. Consistent boundary conditions are imposed, also for settings with open and traction boundaries. Hence, accuracy in time is no longer limited by a splitting error. The symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method is used for second spatial derivatives. The convective term is treated in a semi-implicit manner, which relaxes the CFL restriction of explicit schemes while avoiding the need to solve nonlinear systems required by fully implicit formulations. For improved mass conservation, Leray projection is combined with divergence and normal continuity penalty terms. By selecting appropriate fluxes for both the divergence of the velocity field and the divergence of the convective operator, the consistent pressure boundary condition can be shown to reduce to contributions arising solely from the acceleration and the viscous term for the $L^2$ discretization. Per time step, the decoupled nature of the scheme with respect to the velocity and pressure fields leads to a single pressure Poisson equation followed by a single vector-valued convection-diffusion-reaction equation. We verify optimal convergence rates of the method in both space and time and demonstrate compatibility with higher-order time integration schemes. A series of numerical experiments, including the two-dimensional flow around a cylinder benchmark and the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex problem, verify the applicability to practically relevant flow problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, submitted to CMAME</p></details> |

However, many researchers have argued that this bias does not apply when using cross-validation with vector autoregressions (VAR) or with time series models whose errors follow a martingale-like structure.

Beginning with Bayes' theorem and the philosophical distinctions between Bayesian and frequentist approaches, we develop the inferential framework for estimation, interval construction, hypothesis testing, and prediction. Through canonical models, we illustrate how prior information and observed data are formally integrated to yield posterior distributions. We also explore key concepts including loss functions, credible intervals, Bayes factors, identifiability, and asymptotic behavior. While emphasizing analytical tractability in classical settings, we outline modern extensions that rely on simulation-based methods and discuss challenges related to prior specification and model evaluation. Though focused on foundational ideas, this paper sets the stage for applying Bayesian methods in contemporary domains such as hierarchical modeling, nonparametrics, and structured applications in time series, spatial data, networks, and political science. The goal is to provide a rigorous yet accessible entry point for students and researchers seeking to adopt a Bayesian perspective in statistical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 1 table, 0 figures</p></details> |

However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively. For MCI vs. AD, accuracies are 80.20% (ADNI), 71.91% (AIBL), and 79.73% (OASIS). For NC vs. MCI, results are 76.87% (ADNI), 73.91% (AIBL), and 83.73% (OASIS). These results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only adapts efficiently across multiple sites but also preserves strict privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is already available on GitHub: https://github.com/chenzhao2023/UG_FADDA_AlzhemiersClassification</p></details> |

KANFormer combines a Dilated Causal Convolutional network with a Transformer encoder, enhanced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which improve nonlinear approximation. Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC). We further analyze feature importance over time using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Our results highlight the benefits of combining rich market signals with expressive neural architectures to achieve accurate and interpretabl predictions of fill probabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We propose a novel, interpretable additive model tailored for such data, designed to deliver both high predictive accuracy and clear interpretability. The model features bivariate coefficient surfaces to represent relationships across panel dimensions, with sparsity introduced via penalized smoothing and group bridge regression. This enables simultaneous estimation of the surfaces and identification of significant inter-dimensional effects.

In this paper, we propose TS-Hint, a Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) framework, integrated with chain-of-thought reasoning which provides attention hints during training based on attention mechanism data and saliency data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in limited data settings via few-shot learning and can learn directly from multivariate time series features.</p></details> |  |

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations.

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.</p></details> |  |

However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors.

Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $Δ\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $Δ{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[STELLA: Guiding Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Semantic Abstractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04871v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting often fail to effectively enhance information for raw series, leaving LLM reasoning capabilities underutilized. Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

| **[Random Feature Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01012v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages incl. references & appendix, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Intelligence Foundation Model: A New Perspective to Approach Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10119v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[TARDis: Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement for Incomplete Multi-Modal Tumor Segmentation and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04576v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor segmentation and diagnosis in contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) rely heavily on the physiological dynamics of contrast agents. However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the "missing modality" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTS: Unified Time Series Generative Model for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04461v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the primary objectives of satellite remote sensing is to capture the complex dynamics of the Earth environment, which encompasses tasks such as reconstructing continuous cloud-free time series images, detecting land cover changes, and forecasting future surface evolution. However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Graphical High-Dimensional Time Series Models for Detecting Structural Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04444v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the structural changes in multivariate time-series by estimating and comparing stationary graphs for macroeconomic time series before and after an economic crisis such as the Great Recession. Building on a latent time series framework called Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time-series (OUT), we propose a shared-parameter framework-the spOUT autoregressive model (spOUTAR)-that jointly models two related multivariate time series and enables coherent Bayesian estimation of their corresponding stationary precision matrices. This framework provides a principled mechanism to detect and quantify which conditional relationships among the variables changed, or formed following the crisis. Specifically, we study the impact of the Great Recession (December 2007-June 2009) that substantially disrupted global and national economies, prompting long-lasting shifts in macroeconomic indicators and their interrelationships. While many studies document its economic consequences, far less is known about how the underlying conditional dependency structure among economic variables changed as economies moved from pre-crisis stability through the shock and back to normalcy. Using the proposed approach to analyze U.S. and OECD macroeconomic data, we demonstrate that spOUTAR effectively captures recession-induced changes in stationary graphical structure, offering a flexible and interpretable tool for studying structural shifts in economic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We develop a socio-technical explanation for how generative AI enables and scales cybercrime. Drawing on affordance theory and technological amplification, we argue that generative AI systems create new action possibilities for cybercriminals and magnify pre-existing malicious intent by lowering expertise barriers and increasing attack efficiency. To illustrate this framework, we conduct interrupted time series analyses of two large datasets: (1) 464,190,074 malicious IP address reports from AbuseIPDB, and (2) 281,115 cryptocurrency scam reports from Chainabuse. Using November 30, 2022, as a high-salience public-access shock, we estimate the counterfactual trajectory of reported cyber abuse absent the release, providing an early-warning impact assessment of a general-purpose AI technology. Across both datasets, we observe statistically significant post-intervention increases in reported malicious activity, including an immediate increase of over 1.12 million weekly malicious IP reports and about 722 weekly cryptocurrency scam reports, with sustained growth in the latter. We discuss implications for AI governance, platform-level regulation, and cyber resilience, emphasizing the need for multi-layer socio-technical strategies that help key stakeholders maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its growing cybercrime risks.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating user satisfaction with SIAs' performance is a key factor in designing the interaction between the user and SIA. Currently, subjective user satisfaction is primarily assessed manually through questionnaires or indirectly via system metrics. This study examines the automatic classification of user satisfaction through analysis of social signals, aiming to enhance both manual and autonomous evaluation methods for SIAs. During a field trial at the Deutsches Museum Bonn, a Furhat Robotics head was employed as a service and information hub, collecting an "in-the-wild" dataset. This dataset comprises 46 single-user interactions, including questionnaire responses and video data. Our method focuses on automatically classifying user satisfaction based on time series classification. We use time series of social signal metrics derived from the body pose, time series of facial expressions, and physical distance. This study compares three feature engineering approaches on different machine learning models. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in reliably identifying interactions with low user satisfaction without the need for manually annotated datasets. This approach offers significant potential for enhancing SIA performance and user experience through automated feedback mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03838v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comparison between initialization strategies for the infinite hidden Markov model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03777v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite hidden Markov models provide a flexible framework for modelling time series with structural changes and complex dynamics, without requiring the number of latent states to be specified in advance. This flexibility is achieved through the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior, while efficient Bayesian inference is enabled by the beam sampler, which combines dynamic programming with slice sampling to truncate the infinite state space adaptively. Despite extensive methodological developments, the role of initialization in this framework has received limited attention. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating initialization strategies commonly used for finite hidden Markov models and assessing their suitability in the infinite setting. Results from both simulated and real datasets show that distance-based clustering initializations consistently outperform model-based and uniform alternatives, the latter being the most widely adopted in the existing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges and Limitations of Generative AI in Synthesizing Wearable Sensor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14206v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of wearable sensors has the potential to provide massive and heterogeneous time series data, driving the use of Artificial Intelligence in human sensing applications. However, data collection remains limited due to stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints, hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate both data scarcity and privacy issues. However, these models are often limited to narrow operational scenarios, such as short-term and unimodal signal patterns. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time series data, explicitly assessing their performance in challenging scenarios such as stress and emotion recognition. Our study examines the extent to which these models can jointly handle multi-modality, capture long-range dependencies, and support conditional generation-core requirements for real-world wearable sensor data generation. To enable a fair and rigorous comparison, we also introduce an evaluation framework that evaluates both the intrinsic fidelity of the generated data and their utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data augmentation scenarios. Finally, we present our future research directions to enhance synthetic time series generation and improve the applicability of generative models in the wearable computing domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Deep Tabular Methods with Temporal Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20260v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep tabular models have demonstrated remarkable success on i.i.d. data, excelling in a variety of structured data tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection performs. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables.

Interpretable Neural Networks for Time Series Regression by Learning to Mask and Aggregate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03578v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Invariant Manifolds in ReLU-Based RNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03814v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloodDiffusion: Tailored Diffusion Forcing for Streaming Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03520v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FloodDiffusion, a new framework for text-driven, streaming human motion generation. Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark. Models, code, and weights are available. https://shandaai.github.io/FloodDiffusion/</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Seasonal trend assessment of US extreme precipitation via changepoint segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03513v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most climate trend studies analyze long-term trends as a proxy for climate dynamics. However, when examining seasonal data, it is unrealistic to assume that long-term trends remain consistent across all seasons. Instead, each season likely experiences distinct trends. Additionally, seasonal climate time series, such as seasonal maximum precipitation, often exhibit nonstationarities, including periodicities and location shifts. Failure to rigorously account for these features in modeling may lead to inaccurate trend estimates. This study quantifies seasonal trends in the contiguous United States' seasonal maximum precipitation series while addressing these nonstationarities. To ensure accurate trend estimation, we identify changepoints where the seasonal maximum precipitation shifts due to factors like measurement device changes, observer differences, or location moves. We employ a penalized likelihood method to estimate multiple changepoints, incorporating a generalized extreme value distribution with periodic features. A genetic algorithm based search algorithm efficiently explores the vast space of potential changepoints in both number and timing. Additionally, we compute seasonal return levels for extreme precipitation. Our methods are illustrated using two selected stations, and the results for the US are summarized through maps. We find that seasonal trends vary more when changepoints are considered than in studies that ignore them. Our findings also reveal distinct regional and seasonal patterns, with increasing trends more prevalent during fall in the South and along the East Coast when changepoints are accounted for.</p></details> |  |

ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/uiucsn/ELAsTiCC-Classification).</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 20 figures, 9 tables.

We study distribution-free uncertainty for regime-switching forecasting by coupling Deep Switching State Space Models with Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and its aggregated variant (AgACI). We also introduce a unified conformal wrapper that sits atop strong sequence baselines including S4, MC-Dropout GRU, sparse Gaussian processes, and a change-point local model to produce online predictive bands with finite-sample marginal guarantees under nonstationarity and model misspecification. Across synthetic and real datasets, conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and generally improved band efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing Equilibrium Points of Electrostatic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03249v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the computation of equilibrium points of electrostatic potentials: locations in space where the electrostatic force arising from a collection of charged particles vanishes. This is a novel scenario of optimization in which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a nonconstructive argument, but gradient descent is unreliable due to the presence of singularities. We present an algorithm based on piecewise approximation of the potential function by Taylor series. The main insight is to divide the domain into a grid with variable coarseness, where grid cells are exponentially smaller in regions where the function changes rapidly compared to regions where it changes slowly. Our algorithm finds approximate equilibrium points in time poly-logarithmic in the approximation parameter, but these points are not guaranteed to be close to exact solutions. Nevertheless, we show that such points can be computed efficiently under a mild assumption that we call "strong non-degeneracy". We complement these algorithmic results by studying a generalization of this problem and showing that it is CLS-hard and in PPAD, leaving its precise classification as an intriguing open problem.</p></details> | 35 pages, ITCS'26 |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01987v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Comparative Study on How Data Normalization Affects Zero-Shot Generalization in Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02833v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).</p></details> |  |
| **[MSAD: A Deep Dive into Model Selection for Time series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26643v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

Nevertheless, despite these climate conditions being meaningful for several research and practical applications, our understanding of weather dynamics remains limited. The available meteorological data from 1969 to 2016 is analogical, which presents a significant challenge to analyze because these records are riddled with missing values, some measurements were taken at irregular measuring intervals, making it an interesting puzzle to grasp the Antofagasta's climate scenario. To overcome this issue, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity time series. Our analytical approach involves the q-triplet calculation method, serving as a powerful tool to identify distinctive behavior within systems under non-equilibrium states. Our results suggest that, in general, the q-triplet values satisfy the condition $q_\text{sens}<1<q_\text{stat}<q_\text{rel}$, a pattern that has been observed in previous studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1, table, 3 figures, International Workshop of Statistical Physics</p></details> |

| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoMAE: Masking Representation Learning for Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14083v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of missing data in urban intelligence systems, attributable to adverse environmental conditions and equipment failures, poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of downstream applications, notably in the realms of traffic forecasting and energy consumption prediction. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist. Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks. Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem. Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model. The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.</p></details> | 34 pages |

However, existing methods are often constrained to univariate data, face scalability challenges with large datasets due to computational demands, and experience reduced performance with high-dimensional or intricate data, as well as hidden anomalies. Furthermore, they often lack interpretability and adaptability to domain-specific knowledge, which limits their versatility across different fields. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based CPD/AD method called Probabilistic Predictive Coding (PPC) that jointly learns to encode sequential data to low-dimensional latent space representations and to predict the subsequent data representations as well as the corresponding prediction uncertainties. The model parameters are optimized with maximum likelihood estimation by comparing these predictions with the true encodings. At the time of application, the true and predicted encodings are used to determine the probability of conformance, an interpretable and meaningful anomaly score. Furthermore, our approach has linear time complexity, scalability issues are prevented, and the method can easily be adjusted to a wide range of data types and intricate applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed method across synthetic time series experiments, image data, and real-world magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the distribution shift nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and long temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan collected from Los Angeles, USA, and New South Wales, Australia, curated to support research in extremely long forecasting beyond test adaptation. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle the extremely long forecasting problems beyond test adaptation. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version.

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)</p></details> |
| **[Entropies associated with orbits of finite groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02257v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing web-based agent benchmarks, sequential instruction following in the real world poses significant challenges beyond performing a single, clearly defined task. For instance, real-world human instructions can be ambiguous, require different levels of AI assistance, and may evolve over time, reflecting changes in the user's mental state. To address this gap, we introduce RealWebAssist, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate sequential instruction-following in realistic scenarios involving long-horizon interactions with the web, visual GUI grounding, and understanding ambiguous real-world user instructions. RealWebAssist includes a dataset of sequential instructions collected from real-world human users. Each user instructs a web-based assistant to perform a series of tasks on multiple websites. A successful agent must reason about the true intent behind each instruction, keep track of the mental state of the user, understand user-specific routines, and ground the intended tasks to actions on the correct GUI elements. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art models struggle to understand and ground user instructions, posing critical challenges in following real-world user instructions for long-horizon web assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://scai.cs.jhu.edu/projects/RealWebAssist/ Code: https://github.com/SCAI-JHU/RealWebAssist</p></details> |

Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.</p></details> |  |

TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT.</p></details> |  |

These effects are often characterized by non-linear exposure-lag-response relationships and delayed impacts over time. Accurately capturing these dynamics is crucial for informing public health interventions. The Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM) is a flexible statistical framework for estimating such effects in epidemiological research. However, standard DLNM implementations typically assume a homogeneous exposure-lag-response association across the study region, overlooking potential spatial heterogeneity, which can lead to biased risk estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce DLNM-Clust: a novel mixture of DLNMs that extends the traditional DLNM. Within a Bayesian framework, DLNM-Clust probabilistically assigns each geographic unit to one of $C$ latent spatial clusters, each of which is defined by a distinct DLNM specification. This approach allows capturing both common patterns and singular deviations in the exposure-lag-response surface. We demonstrate the method using municipality-level time-series data on the relationship between air pollution and the incidence of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our results emphasize the importance of spatially aware modeling strategies in environmental epidemiology, facilitating region-specific risk assessment and supporting the development of targeted public health initiatives.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approximately 30 pages, 8 figures, and 5 tables.

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on fixed nonlinear transformations - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or complex real-world data. Furthermore, these methods also exhibit poor scalability in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during optimization. We propose a data-adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, trainable multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike standard NVAR and RC models, the MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities, while preserving a simple readout structure and improving scalability. Initial experiments across multiple chaotic systems, tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions, showed that the adaptive model outperformed in predictive accuracy the standard NVAR, a leaky echo state network (ESN) - the most common RC model - and a hybrid ESN, thereby showing robust forecasting under noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01971v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

| **[Enhancing Large Language Models through Neuro-Symbolic Integration and Ontological Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07640v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language processing but suffer from inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies known as hallucinations. This compromises their reliability, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach integrating symbolic ontological reasoning and machine learning methods to enhance the consistency and reliability of LLM outputs. Our workflow utilizes OWL ontologies, a symbolic reasoner (e.g., HermiT) for consistency checking, and a lightweight machine learning model (logistic regression) for mapping natural language statements into logical forms compatible with the ontology. When inconsistencies between LLM outputs and the ontology are detected, the system generates explanatory feedback to guide the LLM towards a corrected, logically coherent response in an iterative refinement loop. We present a working Python prototype demonstrating this pipeline. Experimental results in a defined domain suggest significant improvements in semantic coherence and factual accuracy of LLM outputs, showcasing the potential of combining LLM fluency with the rigor of formal semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn because Version 1 contains inaccuracies in references and architecture description.

This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Diagnose, Correct, and Learn from Manipulation Failures via Visual Symbols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02787v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

| **[From Hypothesis to Premises: LLM-based Backward Logical Reasoning with Selective Symbolic Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03360v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a core challenge in natural language understanding and a fundamental capability of artificial intelligence, underpinning scientific discovery, mathematical theorem proving, and complex decision-making. Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |
| **[When Do Symbolic Solvers Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03272v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Process Reward Models are Symbolic Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03126v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic ω-automata with obligations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02873v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensions of ω-automata to infinite alphabets typically rely on symbolic guards to keep the transition relation finite, and on registers or memory cells to preserve information from past symbols. Symbolic transitions alone are ill-suited to act on this information, and register automata have intricate formal semantics and issues with tractability. We propose a slightly different approach based on obligations, i.e., assignment-like constructs attached to transitions. Whenever a transition with an obligation is taken, the obligation is evaluated against the current symbol and yields a constraint on the next symbol that the automaton will read. We formalize obligation automata with existential and universal branching and Emerson-Lei acceptance conditions, which subsume classic families such as Büchi, Rabin, Strett, and parity automata. We show that these automata recognise a strict superset of ω-regular languages. To illustrate the practicality of our proposal, we also introduce a machine-readable format to express obligation automata and describe a tool implementing several operations over them, including automata product and emptiness checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

| **[Hyperdimensional Probe: Decoding LLM Representations via Vector Symbolic Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25045v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods either focus on input-oriented feature extraction, such as supervised probes and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), or on output distribution inspection, such as logit-oriented approaches. A full understanding of LLM vector spaces, however, requires integrating both perspectives, something existing approaches struggle with due to constraints on latent feature definitions. We introduce the Hyperdimensional Probe, a hybrid supervised probe that combines symbolic representations with neural probing. Leveraging Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) and hypervector algebra, it unifies prior methods: the top-down interpretability of supervised probes, SAE's sparsity-driven proxy space, and output-oriented logit investigation. This allows deeper input-focused feature extraction while supporting output-oriented investigation. Our experiments show that our method consistently extracts meaningful concepts across LLMs, embedding sizes, and setups, uncovering concept-driven patterns in analogy-oriented inference and QA-focused text generation. By supporting joint input-output analysis, this work advances semantic understanding of neural representations while unifying the complementary perspectives of prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanisms of Symbol Processing for In-Context Learning in Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17498v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in symbol processing through in-context learning (ICL). This success flies in the face of decades of critiques asserting that artificial neural networks cannot master abstract symbol manipulation. We seek to understand the mechanisms that can enable robust symbol processing in transformer networks, illuminating both the unanticipated success, and the significant limitations, of transformers in symbol processing. Borrowing insights from symbolic AI and cognitive science on the power of Production System architectures, we develop a high-level Production System Language, PSL, that allows us to write symbolic programs to do complex, abstract symbol processing, and create compilers that precisely implement PSL programs in transformer networks which are, by construction, 100% mechanistically interpretable. The work is driven by study of a purely abstract (semantics-free) symbolic task that we develop, Templatic Generation (TGT). Although developed through study of TGT, PSL is, we demonstrate, highly general: it is Turing Universal. The new type of transformer architecture that we compile from PSL programs suggests a number of paths for enhancing transformers' capabilities at symbol processing. We note, however, that the work we report addresses computability, and not learnability, by transformer networks. Note: The first section provides an extended synopsis of the entire paper.</p></details> |  |

We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Current Challenges of Symbolic Regression: Optimization, Selection, Model Simplification, and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01682v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $ε$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to a famous large-scale symbolic regression benchmark suite, then running the experiments to assess the symbolic regression landscape, demonstrating that a SR method with the contributions presented in this thesis achieves Pareto-optimal performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>192 p...</summary><p>192 pages.

| **[Masked Symbol Modeling for Demodulation of Oversampled Baseband Communication Signals in Impulsive Noise-Dominated Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01428v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing show that attention mechanism in Transformer networks, trained via masked-token prediction, enables models to capture the semantic context of the tokens and internalize the grammar of language. While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding "in-between" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop on AI and ML for Next-Generation Wireless Communications and Networking (AI4NextG), non-archival</p></details> |
| **[EmoRAG: Evaluating RAG Robustness to Symbolic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01335v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly central to robust AI, enhancing large language model (LLM) faithfulness by incorporating external knowledge. However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as "(@_@)" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2026</p></details> |

Digital twins in industrial environments often struggle with interpretability, real-time adaptation, and human input integration. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining CNN-LSTM dynamic event detection with reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning to enable adaptive intelligence with interpretable decision processes. This integration enhances environmental understanding while promoting continuous learning, leading to more effective real-time decision-making in human-machine collaborative applications. We evaluated ANSR-DT on synthetic industrial data, observing significant improvements over traditional approaches, with up to 99.5% accuracy for dynamic pattern recognition. The framework demonstrated superior adaptability with extended reinforcement learning training, improving explained variance from 0.447 to 0.547. Future work aims at scaling to larger datasets to test rule management beyond the current 14 rules. Our open-source implementation promotes reproducibility and establishes a foundation for future research in adaptive, interpretable digital twins for industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/sbhakim/ansr-dt</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Curve Fitting: Neuro-Symbolic Agents for Context-Aware Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23276v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

| **[Neuro-Symbolic Constrained Optimization for Cloud Application Deployment via Graph Neural Networks and Satisfiability Modulo Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23109v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel hybrid neuro-symbolic framework for the optimal and scalable deployment of component-based applications in the Cloud. The challenge of efficiently mapping application components to virtual machines (VMs) across diverse VM Offers from Cloud Providers is formalized as a constrained optimization problem (COP), considering both general and application-specific constraints. Due to the NP-hard nature and scalability limitations of exact solvers, we introduce a machine learning-enhanced approach where graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on small-scale deployment instances and their predictions are used as soft constraints within the Z3 SMT solver. The deployment problem is recast as a graph edge classification task over a heterogeneous graph, combining relational embeddings with constraint reasoning. Our framework is validated through several realistic case studies, each highlighting different constraint profiles. Experimental results confirm that incorporating GNN predictions improves solver scalability and often preserves or even improves cost-optimality. This work demonstrates the practical benefits of neuro-symbolic coupling for Cloud infrastructure planning and contributes a reusable methodology for general NP-hard problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraining dark matter halo profiles with symbolic regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23073v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures.

Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IJCNLP-AACL workshop on Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact</p></details> |
| **[Can Synthetic Data Improve Symbolic Regression Extrapolation Performance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22794v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many machine learning models perform well when making predictions within the training data range, but often struggle when required to extrapolate beyond it. Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation. Note: An earlier version of this work appeared in the GECCO 2025 Workshop on Symbolic Regression. This arXiv version corrects several parts of the original submission.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 16 figures, GECCO 2025 Symbolic Regression Workshop</p></details> |

This study explains Zipf-like behavior using geometric mechanisms without linguistic elements. The Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) forms words from a finite alphabet, generating a geometric distribution of word lengths. Interacting exponential forces yield a power-law rank-frequency curve, determined by alphabet size and blank symbol probability. Simulations support predictions, matching English, Russian, and mixed-genre data. The symbolic model suggests Zipf-type laws arise from geometric constraints, not communicative efficiency.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compilation of Generalized Matrix Chains with Symbolic Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20198v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Matrix Chains (GMCs) are products of matrices where each matrix carries features (e.g., general, symmetric, triangular, positive-definite) and is optionally transposed and/or inverted. GMCs are commonly evaluated via sequences of calls to BLAS and LAPACK kernels. When matrix sizes are known, one can craft a sequence of kernel calls to evaluate a GMC that minimizes some cost, e.g., the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). Even in these circumstances, high-level languages and libraries, upon which users usually rely, typically perform a suboptimal mapping of the input GMC onto a sequence of kernels. In this work, we go one step beyond and consider matrix sizes to be symbolic (unknown); this changes the nature of the problem since no single sequence of kernel calls is optimal for all possible combinations of matrix sizes. We design and evaluate a code generator for GMCs with symbolic sizes that relies on multi-versioning. At compile-time, when the GMC is known but the sizes are not, code is generated for a few carefully selected sequences of kernel calls. At run-time, when sizes become known, the best generated variant for the matrix sizes at hand is selected and executed. The code generator uses new theoretical results that guarantee that the cost is within a constant factor from optimal for all matrix sizes and an empirical tuning component that further tightens the gap to optimality in practice. In experiments, we found that the increase above optimal in both FLOPs and execution time of the generated code was less than 15\% for 95\% of the tested chains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

In contrast to standard regression models that require a prescribed functional form, SR constructs expressions from a user-defined set of mathematical primitives, enabling the automated discovery of compact formulas that fit the data and reveal underlying physical relationships. In fluid mechanics, where understanding the underlying physics is as crucial as predictive accuracy, this study applies SR to model three-dimensional (3D) laminar flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the axial velocity and pressure fields. Compact symbolic equations were derived from numerical simulation data, accurately reproducing the expected parabolic velocity profile and linear pressure drop, and showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions from the literature. To address the limitation that purely data-driven SR models may overlook domain-specific constraints, an innovative hybrid framework that integrates SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is also introduced. This integration combines the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning capabilities of ASP, ensuring that derived equations remain both statistically accurate and physically plausible. The proposed SR/ASP methodology demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-representation approaches to enhance interpretability, reliability, and alignment with physical principles in fluid dynamics and related domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: The Structured Cognitive Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Polis...</summary><p>Polished the abstract and replaced the demonstration screenshots</p></details> |

Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations. Our results validate symbolic alignment as an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU.</p></details> |  |

In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Figures, Accepted at the 17th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Recover Program Semantics? A Systematic Evaluation with Symbolic Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19130v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.</p></details> |  |

Our automatic unification algorithm implements linguistic rules in symbolic regular expressions.

To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Solve Path Constraints in Symbolic Execution?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18288v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is an important software analysis technique which benefits downstream tasks such as software testing and debugging. However, several limitations hinder symbolic execution from application on real-world software. One of the limitations is the inability to solve diverse execution path constraints: traditional symbolic execution based on SMT solvers is difficult to handle execution paths with complex data structures or external API calls. In this paper, we focus on investigating the possibility of adopting large language models (LLM) for path constraint solving instead of traditional solver-based techniques in symbolic execution. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the ability of LLMs in two types of path constraint solving: generating test inputs to facilitate an execution path, and determining whether a given execution path can be satisfied without triggering any bugs. We build new evaluation pipelines and benchmarks for two tasks: test case generation and path classification, which include data sources from both competition-level programs and real-world repositories. Our experiment results show that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to solve path constraints in both generation and classification tasks, with 60% of generated test cases that accurately cover the given execution path. Moreover, LLMs are capable of improving test coverage by covering execution paths in real-world repositories where traditional symbolic execution tools cannot be applied. These findings highlight the possibility of extending symbolic execution techniques with LLMs in the future to improve the ability and generalizability of symbolic execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChemVTS-Bench: Evaluating Visual-Textual-Symbolic Reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.</p></details> |  |

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we modify SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) embedded with symbolic regression for the temporal encoding, circumventing auto-regressive long-term forecasting for physical data. This is achieved through a new sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to impose sparsity regularization on the latent space, which also allows for immediate symbolic interpretation. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |
| **[Ternary Gamma Semirings as a Novel Algebraic Framework for Learnable Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17728v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability. This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions. We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The widespread adoption of VSAs has, in turn, spurred the development of numerous hardware solutions aimed at optimizing their performance. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive and unified discourse on the convergence of hardware and algorithms in the context of VSAs remains somewhat limited. The paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical software-level explorations and the development of efficient hardware architectures and emerging technology fabrics for VSAs, providing insights from the co-design aspect for researchers from either side. First, we introduce the principles of vector-symbolic computing, including its core mathematical operations and learning paradigms. Second, we provide an in-depth discussion on hardware technologies for VSAs, analyzing analog, mixed-signal, and digital circuit design styles. We compare hardware implementations of VSAs by carrying out detailed analysis of their performance characteristics and tradeoffs, allowing us to extract design guidelines for the development of arbitrary VSA formulations. Third, we discuss a methodology for cross-layer design of VSAs that identifies synergies across layers and explores key ingredients for hardware/software co-design of VSAs. Finally, as a concrete demonstration of this methodology, we propose the first in-memory computing hierarchical cognition hardware system, showcasing the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of this co-design approach. The paper concludes with a discussion of open research challenges for future explorations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vector Symbolic Approach to Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16795v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.</p></details> |  |

Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap.

Hybrid neuro symbolic models combine the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, making them well-suited for these contexts. This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability. We highlight techniques for integrating knowledge graphs with deep inference, embedding fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations. Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI.

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks.</p></details> |  |

We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 27 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |

Central to these applications is the $L^*$ algorithm, introduced by Angluin. The $L^*$ algorithm learns deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) in polynomial time when provided with a minimally adequate teacher. Unfortunately, the $L^*$ algorithm can only learn DFAs over finite alphabets, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we extend $L^*$ to learn symbolic automata whose transitions use predicates over rational numbers, i.e., over infinite and dense alphabets. Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates.</p></details> |  |

Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations.

| **[Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: T...</summary><p>v2: Two TMLR revision rounds addressing reviewer feedback.

However, traditional methods often struggle with search efficiency and fail to integrate knowledge effectively. While recent large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches have demonstrated improvements in search efficiency, they lack the ability to continually refine and expand upon discovered solutions and their underlying knowledge, limiting their potential for open-ended innovation. To address these limitations, we introduce CoEvo, a novel framework that leverages large language models within an evolutionary search methodology to continually generate and refine symbolic solutions. CoEvo integrates a dynamic knowledge library, enabling open-ended innovation of solutions through effective knowledge management. Additionally, CoEvo leverages multiple representations of solutions -- including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code -- to further enhance search efficiency. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the exploratory power of evolutionary algorithms, CoEvo significantly improves the efficiency and scope of symbolic discovery. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative process, marking a significant step towards harnessing LLMs in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

Vanilla approaches, which simply sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM along with the question, incur significant token overhead. This forces aggressive downsampling of long videos, causing models to miss fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, and key temporal cues. Recent works attempt to overcome these limitations through heuristic approaches; however, they lack explicit mechanisms for encoding temporal relationships and fail to provide any formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic required by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA first translates a natural language question into a logic specification that models the temporal relationship between frame-level events. Next, we construct a video automaton to model the video's frame-by-frame event progression, and finally employ model checking to compare the automaton against the specification to identify all video segments that satisfy the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on the LongVideoBench and CinePile LVQA benchmarks show that NeuS-QA significantly improves performance by over 10%, particularly on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step reasoning. We open-source our code at https://utaustin-swarmlab.github.io/NeuS-QA/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09943v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming for d-dimensional Symbolic Regression Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09416v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel CAD data annotation engine that leverages intrinsic attributes from systematically archived CAD drawings to automatically generate high-quality annotations, thus significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. Utilizing this engine, we construct ArchCAD-400K, a large-scale CAD dataset consisting of 413,062 chunks from 5538 highly standardized drawings, making it over 26 times larger than the largest existing CAD dataset. ArchCAD-400K boasts an extended drawing diversity and broader categories, offering line-grained annotations. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model for panoptic symbol spotting, termed Dual-Pathway Symbol Spotter (DPSS). It incorporates an adaptive fusion module to enhance primitive features with complementary image features, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DPSS, demonstrating the value of ArchCAD-400K and its potential to drive innovation in architectural design and construction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Vector Symbolic Algebras for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08747v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Simulate Symbolic Execution Output Like KLEE?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08530v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution helps check programs by exploring different paths based on symbolic inputs. Tools like KLEE are commonly used because they can automatically detect bugs and create test cases. But one of KLEE's biggest issues is how slow it can get when programs have lots of branching paths-it often becomes too resource-heavy to run on large or complex code. In this project, we wanted to see if a large language model like GPT-4o could simulate the kinds of outputs that KLEE generates. The idea was to explore whether LLMs could one day replace parts of symbolic execution to save time and resources. One specific goal was to have GPT-4o identify the most constrained path in a program, this is the execution path with the most symbolic conditions. These paths are especially important because they often represent edge cases that are harder to test and more likely to contain deep bugs. However, figuring this out usually requires fully running KLEE, which can be expensive. So, we tested whether GPT-4o could predict the KLEE outputs and the most complex path using a dataset of 100 C programs. Our results showed about 20% accuracy in generating KLEE-like outputs and identifying the most constrained path. While not highly accurate, this early work helps show what current LLMs can and can't do when it comes to simulating symbolic execution.</p></details> |  |

Symbolic regression serves as a powerful tool for uncovering mathematical models that describe these relationships. It can automatically generate equations to predict material behaviour under specific manufacturing conditions and optimize performance characteristics such as strength and elasticity. The present work illustrates how symbolic regression can derive constitutive models that describe the behaviour of various metallic alloys during plastic deformation. Constitutive modelling is a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between stress and strain in materials under different loading conditions. In this study, two materials (age-hardenable aluminium alloy and high-chromium martensitic steel) and two different testing methods (compression and tension) are considered to obtain the required stress-strain data. The results highlight the benefits of using symbolic regression while also discussing potential challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Special Issue on Symbolic Regression of the Philosphical Transactions of the Royal Society - Part A</p></details> |
| **[Symbol Detection in Multi-channel Multi-tag Ambient Backscatter Communication Under IQ Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08182v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) offers low-cost and low-power connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT), where a backscatter tag (BT) modulates incident signals transmitted by an ambient radio frequency (RF) source and reflects them to its associated AmBC receiver. In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice. To eliminate the need for the prior information, we propose a threshold estimation method using the received samples. Numerical results indicate that under IQ imbalance, directly using the existing method leads to a significant degradation in BER performance. However, this degradation can be effectively mitigated by our derived detection threshold.</p></details> |  |

Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Diffusion as Latent Constraints for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07156v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saliency Map-Guided Knowledge Discovery for Subclass Identification with LLM-Based Symbolic Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07126v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.</p></details> |  |

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Catalog No.: CFP2540S-ART ISBN: 978-9-46-459362-4</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on dense audio embeddings, which are difficult to interpret and often fail on structured reasoning tasks. Caption-based approaches, introduced in recent benchmarks such as MMAU, improve performance by translating audio into text, yet still depend on dense embeddings as input, offering little insight when models fail. We present SAR-LM, a symbolic audio reasoning pipeline that builds on this caption-based paradigm by converting audio into structured, human-readable features across speech, sound events, and music. These symbolic inputs support both reasoning and transparent error analysis, enabling us to trace failures to specific features. Across three benchmarks, MMAU, MMAR, and OmniBench, SAR-LM achieves competitive results, while prioritizing interpretability as its primary contribution.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose \textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion. Furthermore, evaluation and physical implementation of the generated executable RTL code show that these implementations meet all timing constraints without violations, and their performance metrics are consistent with those reported in the original papers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Version, Work in Progress</p></details> |

Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\log(x_1^2)+\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\log(x_1)+3\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriCoT: Neuro-symbolic Chain-of-Thought Validation via Logical Consistency Checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context, commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps. Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for (1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards, further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act. By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions often apply end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA policies in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposable Neuro Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04124v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However, most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions. To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical structure.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving human-like expression and emotion through machine learning models for performance rendering remains a challenging task. In this work, we present SyMuPe, a novel framework for developing and training affective and controllable symbolic piano performance models. Our flagship model, PianoFlow, uses conditional flow matching trained to solve diverse multi-mask performance inpainting tasks. By design, it supports both unconditional generation and infilling of music performance features. For training, we use a curated, cleaned dataset of 2,968 hours of aligned musical scores and expressive MIDI performances. For text and emotion control, we integrate a piano performance emotion classifier and tune PianoFlow with the emotion-weighted Flan-T5 text embeddings provided as conditional inputs. Objective and subjective evaluations against transformer-based baselines and existing models show that PianoFlow not only outperforms other approaches, but also achieves performance quality comparable to that of human-recorded and transcribed MIDI samples. For emotion control, we present and analyze samples generated under different text conditioning scenarios.

We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the grounding process is logically incomplete; specifically, the 'act' of connecting internal symbols to novel, emergent external meanings cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, Gödel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation.

This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator for representing partial data structures, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes the way representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will appear in CPP 2026</p></details> |

In this extended abstract, we detail our attempt to build a neural algorithmic reasoner that can solve Knapsack, a pseudo-polynomial problem bridging classical algorithms and combinatorial optimisation, but omitted in standard NAR benchmarks. Our neural algorithmic reasoner is designed to closely follow the two-phase pipeline for the Knapsack problem, which involves first constructing the dynamic programming table and then reconstructing the solution from it. The approach, which models intermediate states through dynamic programming supervision, achieves better generalization to larger problem instances than a direct-prediction baseline that attempts to select the optimal subset only from the problem inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables, 3 listings</p></details> |
| **[MIND: Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative Reasoning Framework for Multi-modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05530v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied to reasoning tasks. However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of "Understand -> Rethink -> Correct", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/MIND</p></details> |  |

However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models analyze the product to construct high-quality chemical decision space, (2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI predictions and actionable chemical insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing Supported Models via Transformation to Stable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05437v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) with stable model semantics has proven highly effective for knowledge representation and reasoning. However, the minimality requirement of stable models can be restrictive for applications requiring exploration of non-minimal but logically consistent solution spaces. Supported models, introduced by Apt, Blair, and Walker in 1988, relax this minimality constraint while maintaining a support condition ensuring every true atom is justified by some rule. Despite their theoretical significance, supported models lack practical computational tools integrated with modern ASP solvers. We present a novel transformation-based method enabling computation of supported models using standard ASP infrastructure. Our approach transforms any ground logic program into an equivalent program whose stable models correspond exactly to the supported models of the original program. We implement this transformation for Clingo, providing the first practical tool for computing supported models with state-of-the-art ASP solvers. We demonstrate applications in software verification, medical diagnosis, and planning where supported models enable valuable exploratory reasoning capabilities beyond those provided by stable models. We also provide an empirical evaluation to justify the practical utility of our approach compared to established methods. Our implementation is publicly available and compatible with standard ASP syntax.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to FLOPS 2026</p></details> |

Existing context-extension methods struggle to achieve effective semantic modeling and thorough multi-hop reasoning over extensive, intricate circuit specifications. To address this, we introduce ChipMind, a novel knowledge graph-augmented reasoning framework specifically designed for lengthy IC specifications. ChipMind first transforms circuit specifications into a domain-specific knowledge graph ChipKG through the Circuit Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Construction methodology. It then leverages the ChipKG-Augmented Reasoning mechanism, combining information-theoretic adaptive retrieval to dynamically trace logical dependencies with intent-aware semantic filtering to prune irrelevant noise, effectively balancing retrieval completeness and precision. Evaluated on an industrial-scale specification reasoning benchmark, ChipMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 34.59% (up to 72.73%). Our framework bridges a critical gap between academic research and practical industrial deployment of LLM-aided Hardware Design (LAD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAl26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[MCP-AI: Protocol-Driven Intelligence Framework for Autonomous Reasoning in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05365v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare AI systems have historically faced challenges in merging contextual reasoning, long-term state management, and human-verifiable workflows into a cohesive framework. This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines. MCP-AI provides a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI within upcoming clinical environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike numerous attempts to fix Dempster rule, this approach builds from scratch a logically consistent and mathematically rigorous foundation for working with uncertainty, using the dualistic apparatus of possibility and necessity measures. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that possibility theory is not merely an alternative, but provides a fundamental resolution to DST paradoxes. A comparative analysis of three paradigms will be conducted probabilistic, evidential, and possibilistic. Using a classic medical diagnostic dilemma as an example, it will be shown how possibility theory allows for correct processing of contradictory data, avoiding the logical traps of DST and bringing formal reasoning closer to the logic of natural intelligence.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models through Neuro-Symbolic Integration and Ontological Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07640v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language processing but suffer from inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies known as hallucinations. This compromises their reliability, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach integrating symbolic ontological reasoning and machine learning methods to enhance the consistency and reliability of LLM outputs. Our workflow utilizes OWL ontologies, a symbolic reasoner (e.g., HermiT) for consistency checking, and a lightweight machine learning model (logistic regression) for mapping natural language statements into logical forms compatible with the ontology. When inconsistencies between LLM outputs and the ontology are detected, the system generates explanatory feedback to guide the LLM towards a corrected, logically coherent response in an iterative refinement loop. We present a working Python prototype demonstrating this pipeline. Experimental results in a defined domain suggest significant improvements in semantic coherence and factual accuracy of LLM outputs, showcasing the potential of combining LLM fluency with the rigor of formal semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn because Version 1 contains inaccuracies in references and architecture description.

| **[Personalizing Agent Privacy Decisions via Logical Entailment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05065v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personal language model-based agents are becoming more widespread for completing tasks on behalf of users; however, this raises serious privacy questions regarding whether these models will appropriately disclose user data. While prior work has evaluated language models on data-sharing scenarios based on general privacy norms, we focus on personalizing language models' privacy decisions, grounding their judgments directly in prior user privacy decisions. Our findings suggest that general privacy norms are insufficient for effective personalization of privacy decisions. Furthermore, we find that eliciting privacy judgments from the model through In-context Learning (ICL) is unreliable to due misalignment with the user's prior privacy judgments and opaque reasoning traces, which make it difficult for the user to interpret the reasoning behind the model's decisions. To address these limitations, we propose ARIEL (Agentic Reasoning with Individualized Entailment Logic), a framework that jointly leverages a language model and rule-based logic for structured data-sharing reasoning. ARIEL is based on formulating personalization of data sharing as an entailment, whether a prior user judgment on a data-sharing request implies the same judgment for an incoming request. Our experimental evaluations on advanced models and publicly-available datasets demonstrate that ARIEL can reduce the F1 score error by $\textbf{39.1%}$ over language model-based reasoning (ICL), demonstrating that ARIEL is effective at correctly judging requests where the user would approve data sharing. Overall, our findings suggest that combining LLMs with strict logical entailment is a highly effective strategy for enabling personalized privacy judgments for agents.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel framework that leverages ASP's declarative nature and logical reasoning capabilities to encode complex security rules as logical predicates. Our ASP-based system was applied to a real-world Linux system log dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying various anomalies such as potential brute-force attacks, privilege escalations, frequent network connections from specific IPs, and various system-level issues. Key findings highlight ASP's strengths in handling structured log data, rule flexibility, and event correlation. The approach shows promise in providing explainable alerts from real-world data.

| **[Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning via Geometric Projection Reference Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16139v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice offers transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical applicability remains constrained by critical alignment issues: (1) a misalignment between static evaluation benchmarks and the dynamic cognitive demands of clinical practice, (2) challenges in adapting to continuously evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the limited capacity of conventional reward models to reflect nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) with GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints)-a novel alignment framework that structured medical standards into a multi-perspective matrix to guide both data generation and model optimization. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a medical standard system that embeds domain-specific guidelines throughout the training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, transitioning from rule-based or LLM-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for better evaluation performance; and (3) geometric projection reference constraints that translate clinical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and facilitating training with synthetically generated data. Extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of the base Qwen-32B model, with improvements of 45% on the full subset and 85% on the hard subset. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source LLMs, scoring 62.7 (full) and 44.7 (hard), while also surpassing the majority of closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEAL: Self-Evolving Agentic Learning for Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04868v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-based conversational question answering (KBCQA) confronts persistent challenges in resolving coreference, modeling contextual dependencies, and executing complex logical reasoning. Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI for Self-Adaptive Systems: State of the Art and Research Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04680v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems</p></details> |

In many cases, they can also be used to obtain tight complexity bounds and lead to efficient implementations of reasoning tools. More recently, it has been shown that the expressive power provided by the operators characterizing Hybrid Logics (nominals and satisfiability modalities) can be used to internalize labels, leading to well-behaved inference procedures for fairly expressive logics. The resulting procedures are attractive because they do not use external mechanisms outside the language of the logic at hand, and have good logical and computational properties. Many tableau systems based on Hybrid Logic have been investigated, with more recent efforts concentrating on Modal Logics that support data comparison operators. Here, we introduce an internalized tableau calculus for XPath, arguably one of the most prominent approaches for querying semistructured data. More precisely, we define data-aware tableaux for XPath featuring data comparison operators and enriched with nominals and the satisfiability modalities from Hybrid Logic. We prove that the calculus is sound, complete and terminating. Moreover, we show that tableaux can be explored in polynomial space, therefore establishing that the satisfiability problem for the logic is PSpace-complete. Finally, we explore different extensions of the calculus, in particular how to handle data trees and other frame classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches largely reduce it to text only summarization, overlooking the visual component and design intensive nature of slide creation. In this paper we introduce SlideGen, an agentic, modular, and visual in the loop framework for scientific paper to slide generation. SlideGen orchestrates a group of vision language agents that reason collaboratively over the document structure and semantics, producing editable PPTX slides with logical flow and compelling visual presentation. By integrating coordinated outlining, mapping, arrangement, note synthesis, and iterative refinement, our system consistently delivers slides of expert level quality. Across diverse benchmarks and strong baselines, SlideGen outperforms existing methods in visual quality, content faithfulness, and readability, positioning it as the new state of the art in automated slide generation. Our work establishes a foundation for design aware multimodal slide generation, demonstrating how agentic collaboration can bridge understanding and presentation in complex multimodal reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic Tait Computability (STC) provides an abstract treatment of the complex gluing models by internalizing the gluing category into a modal dependent type theory with a phase distinction. This work presents a mechanization of STC in the Istari proof assistant. Istari is a Martin-Löf-style extensional type theory with equality reflection, which avoids much of the explicit transport reasoning typically found in intensional proof assistants. This work develops a reusable library for synthetic phase distinction, including modalities, extension types, and strict glue types, and applies it to two case studies: (1) a canonicity model for dependent type theory with dependent products and booleans with large elimination, and (2) a Kripke canonicity model for the cost-aware logical framework. Our results demonstrate that the core STC constructions can be formalized essentially verbatim in Istari, preserving the elegance of the on-paper arguments while ensuring machine-checked correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[LangSAT: A Novel Framework Combining NLP and Reinforcement Learning for SAT Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04374v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to optimize heuristic selection within the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) process, improving the efficiency of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving. The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time. The combined LangSAT framework offers a more accessible and scalable solution for SAT-solving tasks across reasoning, formal verification, and debugging.</p></details> |  |

An Assessment of the Reasoning Language Models Chain of Thought Mechanism for Digital Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04254v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models in digital forensics has been widely explored. Beyond identifying potential applications, research has also focused on optimizing model performance for forensic tasks through fine-tuning. However, limited result explainability reduces their operational and legal usability. Recently, a new class of reasoning language models has emerged, designed to handle logic-based tasks through an `internal reasoning' mechanism. Yet, users typically see only the final answer, not the underlying reasoning. One of these reasoning models is gpt-oss, which can be deployed locally, providing full access to its underlying reasoning process. This article presents the first investigation into the potential of reasoning language models for digital forensics. Four test use cases are examined to assess the usability of the reasoning component in supporting result explainability. The evaluation combines a new quantitative metric with qualitative analysis. Findings show that the reasoning component aids in explaining and validating language model outputs in digital forensics at medium reasoning levels, but this support is often limited, and higher reasoning levels do not enhance response quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept at DFRWS EU 2026</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Logical Fallacies In Scientific Reasoning From Large Language Models: Towards a Dual-Inference Training Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04228v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and hold growing promise for advancing science, healthcare, and decision-making. Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness. By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 tables |

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement.

In this paper, we provide definitions of these logics as well as establish a suitable proof theory thereof. In particular, we show how to apply the structural refinement methodology to extract cut-free nested sequent calculi for intuitionistic grammar logics from their semantics. This method proceeds by first transforming the semantics of these logics into sound and complete labeled sequent systems, which we prove have favorable proof-theoretic properties such as syntactic cut-elimination. We then transform these labeled systems into nested sequent systems via the introduction of propagation rules and the elimination of structural rules. Our derived proof systems are then put to use, whereby we prove the conservativity of intuitionistic grammar logics over their modal counterparts, establish the general undecidability of these logics, and recognize a decidable subclass, referred to as "simple" intuitionistic grammar logics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.01998</p></details> |

The sigmoid function plays a fundamental role in neural networks; yet, its formal properties, such as differentiability, higher-order derivatives, and limit behavior, have not previously been comprehensively mechanized in a proof assistant. We present a rigorous formalization of the sigmoid function, proving its monotonicity, smoothness, and higher-order derivatives. We provide a constructive proof of the UAT, demonstrating that neural networks with sigmoidal activation functions can approximate any continuous function on a compact interval. Our work identifies and addresses gaps in Isabelle/HOL's formal proof libraries and introduces simpler methods for reasoning about the limits of real functions. By exploiting theorem proving for AI verification, our work enhances trust in neural networks and contributes to the broader goal of verified and trustworthy machine learning.</p></details> | 1 figure |
| **[Modal Logical Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03491v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), a neurosymbolic framework that integrates deep learning with the formal semantics of modal logic, enabling reasoning about necessity and possibility. Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure. This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems & Software</p></details> |

Current solutions primarily rely on controlled, lab-based data collection, which limits their real-world applicability. The challenges towards a fine-grained daily log are 1) contextual awareness, 2) spatial awareness, and 3) effective fusion of multi-modal sensor data. To solve them, we propose EgoLog, which integrates effective audio-IMU fusion for daily log with ubiquitous wearables. Our approach first fuses audio and IMU data from two perspectives: temporal understanding and spatial understanding. We extract scenario-level features and aggregate them in the time dimension, while using motion compensation to enhance the performance of sound source localization. The knowledge obtained from these steps is then integrated into a multi-modal HAR framework. Here, the scenario provides prior knowledge, and the spatial location helps differentiate the user from the background. Furthermore, we integrate a LLM to enhance scenario recognition through logical reasoning. The knowledge derived from the LLM is subsequently transferred back to the local device to enable efficient, on-device inference. Evaluated on both public and self-collected dataset, EgoLog achieves effective multimodal fusion for both activity and scenraio recognition, outperforms the baseline by 12% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SenSys 2026</p></details> |
| **[From Hypothesis to Premises: LLM-based Backward Logical Reasoning with Selective Symbolic Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03360v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a core challenge in natural language understanding and a fundamental capability of artificial intelligence, underpinning scientific discovery, mathematical theorem proving, and complex decision-making. Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |

The result is a unifying framework for modeling and analyzing multi-agent, knowledge-based, dynamic systems.

| **[Training a Scientific Reasoning Model for Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17238v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Process Reward Models are Symbolic Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03126v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

As demonstrated in the MaPLe compiler and run-time system, disentanglement can be exploited for fast automatic memory management, especially task-local garbage collection with no synchronization between parallel tasks. However, as a low-level property, disentanglement can be difficult to reason about for programmers. The only means of statically verifying disentanglement so far has been DisLog, an Iris-fueled variant of separation logic, mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant. DisLog is a fully-featured program logic, allowing for proof of functional correctness as well as verification of disentanglement. Yet its employment requires significant expertise and per-program proof effort. This paper explores the route of automatic verification via a type system, ensuring that any well-typed program is disentangled and lifting the burden of carrying out manual proofs from the programmer. It contributes TypeDis, a type system inspired by region types, where each type is annotated with a timestamp, identifying the task that allocated it. TypeDis supports iso-recursive types as well as polymorphism over both types and timestamps. Crucially, timestamps are allowed to change during type-checking, at join points as well as via a form of subtyping, dubbed subtiming. The paper illustrates TypeDis and its features on a range of examples. The soundness of TypeDis and the examples are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using an improved version of DisLog, dubbed DisLog2.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 24 figures, extended version of the same paper accepted at POPL 2026</p></details> |

This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.</p></details> | IEEE ISNCC 2025 |

Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, as well as guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instruct LLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling the automated synthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with source documents, we are able to generate reasoning questions with controllable question types and difficulty levels. Using this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families. Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing datasets. Notably, by applying SFT on the base versions of these models using only our data, we even surpass their official final models that have undergone the full post-training process.</p></details> |  |

In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the conference paper at POPL 2026.

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.</p></details> |  |

Supervised training approaches struggle with this task due to the lack of large-scale datasets capturing visual consistency and the complexity of modeling human perceptual preferences. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling models to learn complex and subjective visual criteria in a data-free manner. To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability. Together, these results highlight the promise of PaCo-RL as a practical and scalable solution for consistent image generation.

| **[Exploring Depth Generalization in Large Language Models for Solving Recursive Logic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02677v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.</p></details> |  |

Current ethical frameworks in this domain often implicitly rely on contested functionalist assumptions, prioritize speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, and lack coherent theoretical foundations. We address these limitations through a structured three-level framework grounded in philosophical uncertainty. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about AI consciousness alongside human-centralism as our meta-ethical stance. These foundations logically entail three operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (placing the burden of proof on consciousness claims), risk prudence (prioritizing human welfare under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (enabling systematic evaluation and adaptation). At the application level, the third component of our framework, we derive default positions on pressing ethical questions through a transparent logical process where each position can be explicitly traced back to our foundational commitments. Our approach balances philosophical rigor with practical guidance, distinguishes consciousness from anthropomorphism, and creates pathways for responsible evolution as scientific understanding advances, providing a human-centric foundation for navigating these profound ethical challenges.</p></details> |  |

First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\%-11.59\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER establishes a principled and production-validated blueprint for transferring structured LLM reasoning to large-scale recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to some internal company policies, we need to temporarily withdraw the paper.

A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02304v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Separation Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15530v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian probabilistic programming languages (BPPLs) let users denote statistical models as code while the interpreter infers the posterior distribution. The semantics of BPPLs are usually mathematically complex and unable to reason about desirable properties such as expected values and independence of random variables. To reason about these properties in a non-Bayesian setting, probabilistic separation logics such as PSL and Lilac interpret separating conjunction as probabilistic independence of random variables. However, no existing separation logic can handle Bayesian updating, which is the key distinguishing feature of BPPLs. To close this gap, we introduce Bayesian separation logic (BaSL), a probabilistic separation logic that gives semantics to BPPL. We prove an internal version of Bayes' theorem using a result in measure theory known as the Rokhlin-Simmons disintegration theorem. Consequently, BaSL can model probabilistic programming concepts such as Bayesian updating, unnormalised distribution, conditional distribution, soft constraint, conjugate prior and improper prior while maintaining modularity via the frame rule. The model of BaSL is based on a novel instantiation of Kripke resource monoid via $σ$-finite measure spaces over the Hilbert cube, and the semantics of Hoare triple is compatible with an existing denotational semantics of BPPL based on the category of $s$-finite kernels. Using BaSL, we then prove properties of statistical models such as the expected value of Bayesian coin flip, correlation of random variables in the collider Bayesian network, the posterior distributions of the burglar alarm model, a parameter estimation algorithm, and the Gaussian mixture model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to POPL 2026; Extended version with proofs</p></details> |

Succint representations are Boolean circuits computing the adjacency relation. Cw-nontrivial properties are those which have infinitely many models and infinitely many countermodels with bounded cliquewidth. Moreover, we explore what happens when the cw-nontriviality condition is dropped and show that, under a reasonable complexity assumption, the previous dichotomy fails, even for questions expressible in first-order logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Reasoning Beyond Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11373v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their linguistic competence, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to reason reliably and flexibly. To identify these shortcomings, we introduce the Non-Linear Reasoning (NLR) dataset, a collection of 55 unique, hand-designed problems that target reasoning bottlenecks arising from the sequential prediction paradigm of LLMs and the inherently linear nature of natural language. NLR tasks require iterative updates, backtracking, and reasoning across multiple parallel chains of thought but only basic arithmetic to solve. To address these limitations, we propose a neurosymbolic reasoning approach that integrates Prolog, a symbolic reasoning engine, into the inference pipeline of LLMs. This division of labor shifts the LLM's task from iterative computations to inferring all information, explicit or implied through common sense, and encoding it as logical code. Our method yields large and robust performance gains across the GSM8k and BIG-bench Navigate benchmarks and achieves near-perfect accuracy on NLR problems, maintaining robustness even as variable interdependence - the number of other variables on which the value of a single variable depends - increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond SFT: Reinforcement Learning for Safer Large Reasoning Models with Better Reasoning Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01848v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) extend large language models by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, significantly improving mathematical and logical problem solving. However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the Boundary of Solvability: Aligning LLMs to Detect Unsolvable Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01661v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel "Reverse Construction" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/sfasfaffa/unsolvableQA.</p></details> | preprint |

Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper's first error detection task's ground truth data contains hallucination introduced by gpt and needs to be withdrawn</p></details> |
| **[From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24765v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models. However, existing studies often overlook the interaction between logical complexity and semantic complexity, leading to systems that struggle with abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances that are central to human reasoning. We propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework that jointly addresses these two axes of difficulty. The semiotic square provides a principled structure for multi-perspective semantic analysis, and LogicAgent integrates automated deduction with reflective verification to manage logical complexity across deeper reasoning chains. To support evaluation under these conditions, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that couples semantic complexity with logical depth. RepublicQA reaches college-level semantic difficulty (FKGL 11.94), contains philosophically grounded abstract propositions with systematically constructed contrary and contradictory forms, and offers a semantically rich setting for assessing logical reasoning in large language models. Experiments show that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA with a 6.25 percent average improvement over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05 percent average gain. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in enhancing logical performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Learning Branching Networks for Multitask Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01113v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together. We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs. We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages.

Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols in critical domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Extensive experiments across four models and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that CoQ achieves substantial accuracy improvements and significantly lowers invalid SQL rates compared to prior generic LLM-based, SQL-aided, and hybrid baselines, confirming its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

| **[Towards Active Synthetic Data Generation for Finetuning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00884v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common and effective means for improving language model capabilities involves finetuning a ``student'' language model's parameters on generations from a more proficient ``teacher'' model. Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant. We validate these claims across four mathematical and logical reasoning datasets using four different small language models.</p></details> | 14 figures, 36 pages |
| **[GraphIC: A Graph-Based In-Context Example Retrieval Model for Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02203v4)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating demonstration examples, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on the quality of selected examples. Current methods typically use text embeddings to measure semantic similarity, which often introduces bias in multi-step reasoning tasks. This occurs because text embeddings contain irrelevant semantic information and lack deeper reasoning structures. To address this, we propose GraphIC, a graph-based retrieval model that leverages reasoning-aware representation and specialized similarity metric for in-context example retrieval. GraphIC first constructs thought graphs-directed, node-attributed graphs that explicitly model reasoning steps and their dependencies-for candidate examples and queries. This approach filters out superficial semantics while preserving essential reasoning processes. Next, GraphIC retrieves examples using a novel similarity metric tailored for these graphs, capturing sequential reasoning patterns and asymmetry between examples. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms 10 baseline methods. Our results highlight the importance of reasoning-aware retrieval in ICL, offering a robust solution for enhancing LLM performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training, introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 tables, accepted at the International Joint Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR 2025)</p></details> |

Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |

We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.</p></details> |  |

However, specialized expertise is necessary to construct ahigh-quality retrieval system independently; moreover, RAGdemonstratesrelativelyslowerprocessing speeds compared to conventional pure retrieval systems because it involves both retrieval and generation stages. Accordingly, this study proposes SHRAG, a novel framework designed to facilitate the seamless integration of Information Retrieval and RAG while simultaneously securing precise retrieval performance. SHRAG utilizes a Large Language Model as a Query Strategist to automatically transform unstructured natural language queries into logically structured search queries, subsequently performing Boolean retrieval to emulate the search process of an expert human searcher. Furthermore, it incorporates multilingual query expansion and a multilingual embedding model, enabling it to perform efficient cross-lingual question answering within the multilingual dataset environment of the ScienceON Challenge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, combining logical retrieval capabilities and generative reasoning, can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of RAG systems. Furthermore, SHRAG movesbeyondconventionaldocument-centric retrieval methods, presenting the potential for a new search paradigm capable of providing direct and reliable responses to queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm, 3 prompts</p></details> |

We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Logics like HyperLTL have been studied in the past to model check hyperproperties of systems. However, most of the time, requiring strict security properties is actually ineffective as systems do not meet such requirements. To overcome this issue, we introduce qualitative reasoning in HyperLTL, inspired by a similar work on LTL by Almagor, Boker and Kupferman where a formula has a value in the interval [0, 1], obtained by considering either a propositional quality (how much the specification is satisfied), or a temporal quality (when the specification is satisfied). We show decidability of the approximated model checking problem, as well as the model checking of large fragments.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional protocol logic driven by hard-coded state machines struggles to meet the demands of intelligent and autonomous network architectures. Here, we adopt the agentic AI-based paradigm, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by context perception, autonomous reasoning, and tool use. Based on this, we propose Smart-TCP, which re-imagines TCP's core control logic as an autonomous agent. Specifically, the proposed architecture employs a context aggregation mechanism to synthesize the protocol context, utilizes the LLM for autonomous logical reasoning, and invokes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as a tool for computation. Furthermore, we establish a dual-agent interaction framework based on this architecture and implement TCP protocol interactions. Experiments demonstrate that the Smart-TCP agent excels in static prediction and error detection, achieving a 93.33% success rate in end-to-end sessions. These results strongly validate the technical feasibility of an agentic AI-based TCP protocol.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |

Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11278v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases? To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions. To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88-99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning. We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over more complex reasoning. All systems exhibit bias sensitivity (6-35%), which increases with task complexity (up to 49%) and highlights risks in AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field.

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning.

| **[Toward Honest Language Models for Deductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09222v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deductive reasoning is the process of deriving conclusions strictly from the given premises, without relying on external knowledge. We define honesty in this setting as a model's ability to respond only when the conclusion is logically entailed by the premises, and to abstain otherwise. However, current language models often fail to reason honestly, producing unwarranted answers when the input is insufficient. To study this challenge, we formulate honest deductive reasoning as multi-step tasks where models must either derive the correct conclusion or abstain. We curate two datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that prompting and existing training methods, including GRPO with or without supervised fine-tuning initialization, struggle on these tasks. In particular, GRPO optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. To address this, we propose ACNCHOR, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling honest deductive reasoning in language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[All for One and One for All: Program Logics for Exploiting Internal Determinism in Parallel Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23283v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nondeterminism makes parallel programs challenging to write and reason about. To avoid these challenges, researchers have developed techniques for internally deterministic parallel programming, in which the steps of a parallel computation proceed in a deterministic way. Internal determinism is useful because it lets a programmer reason about a program as if it executed in a sequential order. However, no verification framework exists to exploit this property and simplify formal reasoning about internally deterministic programs. To capture the essence of why internally deterministic programs should be easier to reason about, this paper defines a property called schedule-independent safety. A program satisfies schedule-independent safety, if, to show that the program is safe across all orderings, it suffices to show that one terminating execution of the program is safe. We then present a separation logic called Musketeer for proving that a program satisfies schedule-independent safety. Once a parallel program has been shown to satisfy schedule-independent safety, we can verify it with a new logic called Angelic, which allows one to dynamically select and verify just one sequential ordering of the program. Using Musketeer, we prove the soundness of MiniDet, an affine type system for enforcing internal determinism. MiniDet supports several core algorithmic primitives for internally deterministic programming that have been identified in the research literature, including a deterministic version of a concurrent hash set. Because any syntactically well-typed MiniDet program satisfies schedule-independent safety, we can apply Angelic to verify such programs. All results in this paper have been verified in Rocq using the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 26 figures, extended version of the same paper accepted at POPL 2026</p></details> |

In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.</p></details> |  |

A Longitudinal Study of Philosophers' Evolving Perceptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23188v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the evolving attitudes of philosophy scholars towards the participation of generative AI based Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) in philosophical discourse. We conducted a three year (2023--2025) mixed methods longitudinal study with 16 philosophy scholars and students. Qualitative data from annual interviews reveal a three stage evolution in attitude: from initial resistance and unfamiliarity, to instrumental acceptance of the IUI as a tool, and finally to a deep principled questioning of the IUI's fundamental capacity for genuine philosophical thought. Quantitative data from blind assessments, where participants rated anonymized philosophical answers from both humans and an IUI, complement these findings. While participants acknowledged the IUI's proficiency in tasks requiring formal logic and knowledge reproduction, they consistently identified significant shortcomings in areas demanding dialectical reasoning, originality and embodied understanding. The study concludes that participants do not see the IUI as a peer but rather as a sophisticated mirror whose capabilities and limitations provoke a deeper reflection on the unique and irreplaceable human dimensions of philosophical inquiry, such as intuition, value laden commitment and the courage to question fundamental premises.</p></details> |  |

We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment. We apply LockForge to 10 seminal LL schemes, many of which lack reference implementations. Our evaluation on multiple SOTA LLMs, including ablation studies, reveals the significant complexity of the task. We show that an advanced reasoning model and a sophisticated, multi-stage framework like LockForge are required. We release all implementations and benchmarks, providing a reproducible and fair foundation for evaluation of further LL research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Rules from Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13599v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can flexibly generalize knowledge across domains by leveraging structured relational representations. While prior research has shown how such representations support analogical reasoning, less is known about how they are recruited to guide adaptive behavior. We address this gap by introducing the Relational Regression Tree Learner (RRTL), a model that incrementally builds policies over structured relational inputs by selecting task-relevant relations during the learning process. RRTL is grounded in the framework of relational reinforcement learning but diverges from traditional approaches by focusing on ground (i.e., non-variabilized) rules that refer to specific object configurations. Across three Atari games of increasing relational complexity (Breakout, Pong, Demon Attack), the model learns to act effectively by identifying a small set of relevant relations from a broad pool of candidate relations. A comparative version of the model, which partitions the state space using relative magnitude values (e.g., "more", "same", "less"), showed more robust learning than a version using logical (binary) splits. These results provide a proof of principle that reinforcement signals can guide the selection of structured representations, offering a computational framework for understanding how relational knowledge is learned and deployed in adaptive behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[REVEAL: Reasoning-enhanced Forensic Evidence Analysis for Explainable AI-generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23158v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Discovery of Heuristic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23122v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIM-PRM: Verifying multimodal reasoning with Tool-Integrated PRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22998v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Verifiable CoT from Execution-Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00127v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching language models to reason about code execution remains a fundamental challenge. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, current synthetic training data suffers from a critical weakness: the reasoning steps are often plausible-sounding explanations generated by teacher models, not verifiable accounts of what the code actually does. This creates a troubling failure mode where models learn to mimic superficially convincing but logically flawed reasoning patterns. We address this by grounding CoT generation directly in program execution traces. Our pipeline instruments code to capture its dynamic behavior, then narrates these verified execution traces into natural language rationales that are correct by construction. This execution-grounded approach ensures every reasoning step reflects what the program genuinely computes, eliminating logical hallucinations at the source. We evaluate our method on code reasoning tasks (forward reasoning on CruxEval and LiveCodeBench-Exec, backward reasoning on CruxEval-Input), as well as code generation and explanation tasks from HumanEval. Models trained on our bi-directional trace-grounded data achieve substantial improvements, with gains of up to 30 points on output prediction and 28 points on input prediction over base models, alongside improved explanation and code generation, demonstrating that verifiable reasoning fundamentally enhances model capabilities. https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Research-AI/Verified-Code-CoT</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAwDAD: Causal Reasoning Augmentation with Dual-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22854v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing "what if" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Domain adaptation of large language models for geotechnical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05613v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is transforming opportunities in geotechnical engineering, where workflows rely on complex, text-rich data. While general-purpose LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, their effectiveness in geotechnical applications is constrained by limited exposure to specialized terminology and domain logic. Thus, domain adaptation, tailoring general LLMs for geotechnical use, has become essential. This paper presents the first systematic review of LLM adaptation and application in geotechnical contexts. It critically examines four key adaptation strategies, including prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning, and evaluates their comparative benefits, limitations, and implementation trends. This review synthesizes current applications spanning geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, design analysis, numerical modeling, risk assessment, and geotechnical education. Findings show that domain-adapted LLMs substantially improve reasoning accuracy, automation, and interpretability, yet remain limited by data scarcity, validation challenges, and explainability concerns. Future research directions are also suggested. This review establishes a critical foundation for developing geotechnically literate LLMs and guides researchers and practitioners in advancing the digital transformation of geotechnical engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Logic for Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13635v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[ShieldAgent: Shielding Agents via Verifiable Safety Policy Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22738v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption across various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometrically-Constrained Agent for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22659v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/XiyanLiu/RoadSceneBench.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present NOMAD, a cognitively inspired, modular multi-agent framework that decomposes UML generation into a series of role-specialised subtasks. Each agent handles a distinct modelling activity, such as entity extraction, relationship classification, and diagram synthesis, mirroring the goal-directed reasoning processes of an engineer. This decomposition improves interpretability and allows for targeted verification strategies. We evaluate NOMAD through a mixed design: a large case study (Northwind) for in-depth probing and error analysis, and human-authored UML exercises for breadth and realism. NOMAD outperforms all selected baselines, while revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained attribute extraction. Building on these observations, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of errors in LLM-generated UML diagrams, categorising structural, relationship, and semantic/logical. Finally, we examine verification as a design probe, showing its mixed effects and outlining adaptive strategies as promising directions. Together, these contributions position NOMAD as both an effective framework for UML class diagram generation and a lens onto the broader research challenges of reliable language-to-model workflows.</p></details> |  |

To do that, we expand Gödel modal logic KG with the involutive negation ~ defined as v(~A,w)=1-v(A,w). We provide semantics with the finite model property for our new logic that we call KG_inv and show its equivalence to the standard semantics over [0,1]-valued Kripke models. Namely, we show that a formula is valid in the standard semantics of KG_inv iff it is valid in the new semantics. Using this new semantics, we construct a constraint tableaux calculus for KG_inv that allows for an explicit extraction of countermodels from complete open branches and then employ the tableaux calculus to obtain the PSPACE-completeness of the validity in KG_inv.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TARK 2025, arXiv:2511.20540</p></details> |

We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TARK 2025, arXiv:2511.20540</p></details> |
| **[Hyperintensional Intention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22371v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intentions are crucial for our practical reasoning. The rational intention obeys some simple logical principles, such as agglomeration and consistency, among others, motivating the search for a proper logic of intention. However, such a logic should be weak enough not to force the closure under entailment; otherwise, we cannot distinguish between intended consequences of agents' choices and their unintended side-effects. In this paper we argue that we should avoid not only the closure under entailment, but the weaker closure under equivalence as well. To achieve this, we develop a hyperintensional logic of intention, where what an agent intends is constrained by the agent's decision problem. The proposed system combines some elements of inquisitive and topic-sensitive theories of intensional modals. Along the way, we also show that the existing closest relatives of our framework overgenerate validities by validating some instances of closure under equivalence. Finally, we provide a sound and strongly complete axiomatization for this logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TARK 2025, arXiv:2511.20540</p></details> |

We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to +5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%) and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%), functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Guiding the Inner Eye: A Framework for Hierarchical and Flexible Visual Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22172v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 9pages |
| **[Reasoning about expression evaluation under interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07741v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hoare-style inference rules for program constructs permit the copying of expressions and tests from program text into logical contexts. It is known that this requires care even for sequential programs but much more serious issues arise with concurrent programs because of potential interference to the values of variables. The "rely-guarantee" approach tackles the challenge of recording acceptable interference and offers a way to provide safe inference rules for concurrent constructs. This paper shows how the algebraic presentation of rely-guarantee ideas can clarify and formalise the conditions for safely re-using expressions and tests from program text in logical contexts for reasoning about concurrent programs; crucially this extends to handling expressions that reference more than one shared variable. A non-trivial example related to the Fischer-Galler forest representation of equivalence relations is treated.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A perceptual bias of AI Logical Argumentation Ability in Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22151v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Searching Meta Reasoning Skeleton to Guide LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04116v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta reasoning behaviors work as a skeleton to guide large language model (LLM) reasoning, thus help to improve reasoning performance. However, prior researches implement meta reasoning skeleton with manually designed structure, limiting ability to adapt to query-specific requirement and capture intricate logical dependency among reasoning steps. To deal with the challenges, we represent meta reasoning skeleton with directed acyclic graph (DAG) to unify skeletons proposed in prior works and model intricate logical dependency. Then we propose AutoMR, a framework that searches for query-aware meta reasoning skeleton automatically inspired by automated machine learning (AutoML). Specifically, we construct search space based on DAG representation of skeleton and then formulate the search problem. We design a dynamic skeleton sampling algorithm by expanding meta reasoning skeleton along with reasoning context at inference time. This algorithm can derive any meta reasoning skeleton in search space efficiently and adapt skeleton to evolving base reasoning context, thus enable efficient query-aware skeleton search. We conduct experiments on extensive benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that AutoMR achieves better reasoning performance than previous works broadly.</p></details> |  |
| **[VITA: Zero-Shot Value Functions via Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10085v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise as zero-shot goal-conditioned value functions, but their frozen pre-trained representations limit generalization and temporal reasoning. We introduce VITA, a zero-shot value function learning method that enhances both capabilities via test-time adaptation. At inference, a lightweight adaptation module is updated via a gradient step on a meta-learned self-supervised loss, such that each test-time update improves value estimation. By updating sequentially over a trajectory, VITA encodes history into its parameters, addressing the temporal reasoning limitations. To mitigate shortcut learning, we propose a dissimilarity-based sampling strategy that selects semantically diverse segments of the trajectory during training. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks, VITA generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art zero-shot method using autoregressive VLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VITA's zero-shot value estimates can be utilized for reward shaping in offline reinforcement learning, resulting in multi-task policies on the Meta-World benchmark that exceed the performance of those trained with the simulation's fuzzy-logic dense rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Learner with Grow-and-Refine Multimodal Semantic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21678v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.
