| **[Diffusion Language Models are Provably Optimal Parallel Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25014v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Steering for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24143v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08554v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions. Building on this insight, we introduce Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines, on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeDLM: Reconciling Diffusion Language Models with Standard Causal Attention for Fast Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22737v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, project page: https://wedlm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[On the Role of Discreteness in Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22630v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models offer appealing properties for language generation, such as parallel decoding and iterative refinement, but the discrete and highly structured nature of text challenges the direct application of diffusion principles. In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dream-VL & Dream-VLA: Open Vision-Language and Vision-Language-Action Models with Diffusion Language Model Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22615v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Behavior of Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10858v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs. We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[dUltra: Ultra-Fast Diffusion Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21446v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) offer the potential for parallel token generation, but most open-source MDLMs decode fewer than 5 tokens per model forward pass even with sophisticated sampling strategies. As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaDA2.0: Scaling Up Diffusion Language Models to 100B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15745v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[DiffusionVL: Translating Any Autoregressive Models into Diffusion Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15713v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |
| **[Why mask diffusion does not work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03289v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR) models lie in their ability to support parallel generation and bidirectional attention, enabling a more controllable generation process. In recent years, open-source mask diffusion language models have emerged, most of which are based on a variant known as absorbing diffusion. However, this paper demonstrates why mask diffusion faces inherent difficulties in achieving parallel generation and bidirectional attention. We also propose the most effective training and inference strategies for mask diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiRL: An Efficient Post-Training Framework for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22234v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Initialization for Reducing Generative Path Length in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19004v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) enable fully parallel token decoding but often remain impractical at inference time due to the many denoising iterations required to refine an information-free, fully masked initialization into coherent text. Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization. We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Diffusion Duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10892v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude.

| **[Corrective Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15596v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Efficient-DLM: From Autoregressive to Diffusion Language Models, and Beyond in Speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14067v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-guided multi-property molecular optimization with a diffusion language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v4)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby mitigating error propagation during diffusion process. By fusing physically and chemically detailed textual semantics with specialized molecular representations, TransDLM effectively integrates diverse information sources to guide precise optimization, which enhances the model's ability to balance structural retention and property enhancement. Additionally, the success of a case study further demonstrates TransDLM's ability to solve practical problems. Experimentally, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in maintaining molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Information Fusion, Vol. 127, 103907, 2026</p></details> |
| **[Sparse-LaViDa: Sparse Multimodal Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14008v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (12 pages for the main paper and 6 pages for the appendix), 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Reproducing and Dissecting Denoising Language Models for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13576v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising language models (DLMs) have been proposed as a powerful alternative to traditional language models (LMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), motivated by their ability to use bidirectional context and adapt to a specific ASR model's error patterns. However, the complexity of the DLM training pipeline has hindered wider investigation. This paper presents the first independent, large-scale empirical study of DLMs. We build and release a complete, reproducible pipeline to systematically investigate the impact of key design choices. We evaluate dozens of configurations across multiple axes, including various data augmentation techniques (e.g., SpecAugment, dropout, mixup), different text-to-speech systems, and multiple decoding strategies. Our comparative analysis in a common subword vocabulary setting demonstrates that DLMs outperform traditional LMs, but only after a distinct compute tipping point. While LMs are more efficient at lower budgets, DLMs scale better with longer training, mirroring behaviors observed in diffusion language models. However, we observe smaller improvements than those reported in prior character-based work, which indicates that the DLM's performance is conditional on factors such as the vocabulary. Our analysis reveals that a key factor for improving performance is to condition the DLM on richer information from the ASR's hypothesis space, rather than just a single best guess. To this end, we introduce DLM-sum, a novel method for decoding from multiple ASR hypotheses, which consistently outperforms the previously proposed DSR decoding method. We believe our findings and public pipeline provide a crucial foundation for the community to better understand, improve, and build upon this promising class of models.

| **[Beyond Next-Token Prediction: A Performance Characterization of Diffusion versus Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04146v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document processing and code generation. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. While these models have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency in next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output tokens in parallel, mitigating the limitations of sequential decoding. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, combining theoretical analysis with empirical profiling to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We show that although DLMs can achieve higher arithmetic intensity than ARMs by leveraging parallelism across token positions, they fail to scale effectively with longer contexts. We then explore block-wise decoding for DLMs, which decouples arithmetic intensity from sequence length and enables better scaling to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also examine batched inference and find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, emphasizing that reducing the number of sampling steps is key for open-source DLMs to achieve lower latency relative to ARMs.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Diffusion Language Model Inference with Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12168v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive generation, offering parallel generation and improved global coherence. During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Unmasking Policies for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09106v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion (Large) Language Models (dLLMs) now match the downstream performance of their autoregressive counterparts on many tasks, while holding the promise of being more efficient during inference. One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: F...</summary><p>V2: Fixed typo in author list.

| **[d-TreeRPO: Towards More Reliable Policy Optimization for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09675v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable reinforcement learning (RL) for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) requires both accurate advantage estimation and precise estimation of prediction probabilities. Existing RL methods for dLLMs fall short in both aspects: they rely on coarse or unverifiable reward signals, and they estimate prediction probabilities without accounting for the bias relative to the true, unbiased expected prediction probability that properly integrates over all possible decoding orders. To mitigate these issues, we propose \emph{d}-TreeRPO, a reliable RL framework for dLLMs that leverages tree-structured rollouts and bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards to provide fine-grained and verifiable step-wise reward signals. When estimating the conditional transition probability from a parent node to a child node, we theoretically analyze the estimation error between the unbiased expected prediction probability and the estimate obtained via a single forward pass, and find that higher prediction confidence leads to lower estimation error. Guided by this analysis, we introduce a time-scheduled self-distillation loss during training that enhances prediction confidence in later training stages, thereby enabling more accurate probability estimation and improved convergence. Experiments show that \emph{d}-TreeRPO outperforms existing baselines and achieves significant gains on multiple reasoning benchmarks, including +86.2 on Sudoku, +51.6 on Countdown, +4.5 on GSM8K, and +5.3 on Math500.

| **[Attention Sinks in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15731v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Next-Token to Next-Block: A Principled Adaptation Path for Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generation but dominant autoregressive (AR) decoding is inherently sequential, creating a throughput bottleneck. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)--especially block-wise variants--enable parallel generation and intra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use a context-causal attention mask (causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly with masked block-diffusion and maintains train-inference consistency. Built on these components, NBDiff-7B (Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines. These results demonstrate that principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is an effective and compute-efficient alternative to training DLMs from scratch.

By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

The denoising strategy plays an important role in determining the quality of their outputs. Mainstream denoising strategies include Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion. Standard Diffusion performs global denoising without restricting the update range, often finalizing incomplete context and causing premature end-of-sequence predictions. BlockDiffusion updates fixed-size blocks in a preset order, but its rigid structure can break apart coherent semantic units and disrupt reasoning. We present WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach that expands a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions. This adaptive process follows the natural flow of semantic structure while keeping computational cost equal to block-based methods. Across four benchmarks in reasoning and code generation, WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity, showing the value of adaptive scheduling for more coherent and efficient generation.</p></details> | 19 pages. 3 figures |

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Static Cutoffs: One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02077v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24% tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy, and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems innovations in diffusion decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, NeurIPS 2025 Efficient Reasoning Workshop</p></details> |
| **[C$^2$DLM: Causal Concept-Guided Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22146v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) language models and Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) constitute the two principal paradigms of large language models. However, both paradigms suffer from insufficient reasoning capabilities. Human reasoning inherently relies on causal knowledge and thought, which are reflected in natural language. But in the AR paradigm, language is modeled as next token prediction (a strictly left-to-right, token-by-token order), whereas natural language itself exhibits more flexible causal structures. In the DLM paradigm, the attention mechanism is fully connected, which entirely disregards causal order. To fill this gap, we propose a \underline{\textbf{C}}ausal \underline{\textbf{C}}oncept-Guided \underline{\textbf{D}}iffusion \underline{\textbf{L}}anguage \underline{\textbf{M}}odel (C$^2$DLM). Starting from DLM's fully connected attention, C$^2$DLM first obtains a concept-level causal graph from the teacher model, and then explicitly guides attention to learn causal relationships between concepts. By focusing on causal relationships and avoiding interference from difficult subgoals involving causal inversion, C$^2$DLM improves 12\% with about 3.2 times training speedup in the COT-OrderPerturb task, and achieves an average gain of 1.31\% across six downstream reasoning tasks.

| **[Closed-Loop Transformers: Autoregressive Modeling as Iterative Latent Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21882v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary autoregressive transformers operate in open loop: each hidden state is computed in a single forward pass and never revised, causing errors to propagate uncorrected through the sequence. We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Masks Can Be Distracting: On Context Comprehension in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21338v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Confidence: Adaptive and Coherent Decoding for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02044v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Bits to Rounds: Parallel Decoding with Exploration for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21103v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks.

Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity.

Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance. The implementation is available via https://github.com/Mr-Peach0301/MindRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Powerful Ways to Generate: Autoregression, Diffusion, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06190v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to autoregressive language models. Beyond next-token generation, they are more efficient and flexible by enabling parallel and any-order token generation. However, despite empirical successes, their computational power and fundamental limitations remain poorly understood. In this paper, we formally study whether non-autoregressive generation in Masked Diffusion Models (MDM) enables solving problems beyond the reach of Auto-Regressive Models (ARM). Our results show that MDM with sufficiently large context length is computationally universal with decoding steps matching the optimal parallel time complexity in PRAM. However, when controlling for other factors, MDM's flexibility to generate in any-order does not expand what ARM can already solve. To address this, we propose a new form of generation called any-process generation, which extends MDM with capabilities to remask, insert and delete tokens, allowing self-correction, length-variable editing, and adaptive parallelism. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate these capabilities enable scalability to significantly harder reasoning problems that are otherwise intractable for ARM and vanilla MDM. Additionally, they prove essential for generation tasks where objects naturally evolve through non-sequential processes, crucial for extending current LLMs beyond natural language to domains such as coding and science.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic, unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields 65.9% and 62.3% adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively, versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks, including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.</p></details> | NVIDIA-Tech Report |

Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However, there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory of univariate function approximation. By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely, its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Diffusion Language Models are Super Data Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03276v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation; input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lookahead Unmasking Elicits Accurate Decoding in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05563v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watermarking Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02083v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique to track AI-generated content and differentiate it from authentic human creations. While prior work extensively studies watermarking for autoregressive large language models (LLMs) and image diffusion models, none address discrete diffusion language models, which are becoming popular due to their high inference throughput. In this paper, we introduce the first watermarking method for discrete diffusion models by applying the distribution-preserving Gumbel-max trick at every diffusion step and seeding the randomness with the sequence index to enable reliable detection. We experimentally demonstrate that our scheme is reliably detectable on state-of-the-art diffusion language models and analytically prove that it is distortion-free with an exponentially decaying probability of false detection in the token sequence length.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffuse Thinking: Exploring Diffusion Language Models as Efficient Thought Proposers for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27469v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs) can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research. Our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Diffuse-Thinking-EC60.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcing the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought with Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10446v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT), a reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings).

| **[Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps, erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0). Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Simple Denoising Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22926v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models (USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encoder-Decoder Diffusion Language Models for Efficient Training and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22852v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1) representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2), consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks (sacrificing bidirectionality), but we find that this also leads to time-interval expansion problem, sacrificing the speed. Therefore, semi-AR eliminates the main advantages of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight</p></details> |

However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance, especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation: intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically, our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19529v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Compute Left Behind: Rethinking Reasoning and Sampling with Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19990v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models. Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2) multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks, any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance. At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces. Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second, we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saber: An Efficient Sampling with Adaptive Acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking for Diffusion Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft-Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17206v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planner and Executor: Collaboration between Discrete Diffusion And Autoregressive Models in Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15244v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence. Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently, our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at https://github.com/seal-rg/recurrent-pretraining</p></details> |

Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19982v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> |  |

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partition Generative Modeling: Masked Modeling Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18883v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked generative models (MGMs) are widely used to capture complex data and enable faster generation than autoregressive models (AR) through parallel decoding. However, MGMs typically operate on fixed-length inputs, which can be inefficient: early in sampling, most tokens are masked and carry no information, leading to wasted computation. In contrast, AR models process only tokens generated previously, making early iterations faster. In this work, we introduce the Partition Generative Model (PGM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of AR and MGMs. Rather than masking, PGM partitions tokens into two groups and employs sparse attention to block information flow between them. Since there is no information flow between partitions, the model can process the previously-generated tokens only during sampling, while retaining the ability to generate tokens in parallel and in any order. On OpenWebText, PGMs offer at least $5\times$ improvements in sampling latency and throughput, while producing samples with superior Generative Perplexity, compared to Masked Diffusion Language Models. On ImageNet, PGMs achieve a $7.5\times$ higher throughput than MaskGIT, with only a slight increase in FID (5.54 vs. 5.35). With twice as many sampling steps, the FID reduces to 4.56 while while being $3.9\times$ faster than MaskGIT. Finally, PGMs integrate seamlessly with MGM distillation, providing further inference speedups.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashDLM: Accelerating Diffusion Language Model Inference via Efficient KV Caching and Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21467v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match the quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B, Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First, we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver an average of 12.14x end-to-end speedup across various tasks with negligible accuracy degradation. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Next Semantic Scale Prediction via Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08632v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative perplexity than baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective tools to harness them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://aim-uofa.github.io/dLLM-MidTruth</p></details> |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling of Diffusion Language Models with Particle Gibbs Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08390v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, matching their performance through large-scale training. However, inference-time control remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we study how to steer generation toward desired rewards without retraining the models. Prior methods typically resample or filter within a single denoising trajectory, optimizing rewards step-by-step without trajectory-level refinement. We introduce particle Gibbs sampling for diffusion language models (PG-DLM), a novel inference-time algorithm enabling trajectory-level refinement while preserving generation perplexity under reward optimization. PG-DLM constructs a Markov chain over full denoising trajectories and applies a conditional sequential Monte Carlo kernel to resample them. We derive theoretical guarantees for convergence, including asymptotic consistency and variance bounds. Within this framework, we further analyze trade-offs across four key axes for inference-time scaling under fixed budgets: iterations, samples, denoising steps, and reward estimation. Our analysis shows scaling iterations achieves the best reward-perplexity trade-off. Empirically, PG-DLM consistently outperforms prior methods using MDLM and LLaDA-8B as base models across a wide range of compute budgets for reward-guided generation tasks including toxicity and sentiment control as well as linguistic acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g. reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and 1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO. Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion: Make Your Diffusion Language Model a Latent Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03206v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages |

We first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-Aware Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01544v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that initializes from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) and distills a few-step student for fast generation. The resulting DiDi-Instruct model achieves comparable or superior performance to its dLLM teacher and the GPT-2 baseline while enabling up to 64$\times$ acceleration. The theoretical foundation of DiDi-Instruct is a novel framework based on integral KL-divergence minimization, which yields a practical training algorithm. We further introduce grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler that significantly improve training stability, model coverage, and inference quality. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct achieves perplexity from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs), which outperforms prior accelerated dLLMs and GPT-2 baseline. These gains come with a negligible entropy loss (around $1\%$) and reduce additional training wall-clock time by more than $20\times$ compared to competing dLLM distillation methods. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye.

| **[Syntax-Guided Diffusion Language Models with User-Integrated Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01028v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality, diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Safer Diffusion Language Models: Discovery and Mitigation of Priming Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00565v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs - marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE models are available at Huggingface.</p></details> |  |

While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation. We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).</p></details> | preprint |
| **[SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs. Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections. Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/INV-WZQ/SparseD</p></details> |

Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost. Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks, but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence, thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm.

Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables.

Speculative decoding addresses this by employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning, parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and (ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for speculative decoding.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages,11 figures |
| **[Planner Aware Path Learning in Diffusion Language Models Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23405v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths, planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work, we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap, we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective. Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://ai-isl.github.io/A2D</p></details> |
| **[Tree Reward-Aligned Search for TReASURe in Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23146v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges: (i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration, and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i) UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs (number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only (Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of 0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

| **[Activation Steering for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24143v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Behavior of Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10858v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs. We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-GRPO: Co-Optimized Group Relative Policy Optimization for Masked Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22288v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Decoding Paths in Masked Diffusion Models by Quantifying Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21336v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why mask diffusion does not work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03289v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR) models lie in their ability to support parallel generation and bidirectional attention, enabling a more controllable generation process. In recent years, open-source mask diffusion language models have emerged, most of which are based on a variant known as absorbing diffusion. However, this paper demonstrates why mask diffusion faces inherent difficulties in achieving parallel generation and bidirectional attention. We also propose the most effective training and inference strategies for mask diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Diffusion Duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10892v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude.

| **[Fine-Tuning Masked Diffusion for Provable Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01384v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality, limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM. Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales: Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authorship statement: Jaeyeon Kim and Seunggeun Kim contributed equally, and Taekyun Lee is also a co first author</p></details> |
| **[Masked Diffusion for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Corrective Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15596v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance.

| **[Error Bounds and Optimal Schedules for Masked Diffusions with Factorized Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25544v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Language Models: Balancing Training Efficiency and Overfitting Resilience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14549v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13586v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Unmasking Policies for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09106v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion (Large) Language Models (dLLMs) now match the downstream performance of their autoregressive counterparts on many tasks, while holding the promise of being more efficient during inference. One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: F...</summary><p>V2: Fixed typo in author list.

| **[Attention Sinks in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15731v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAM-Diff: A Masked Diffusion VLA Framework with MoE and Online Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11872v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture'), but lack editing functionality, are limited to rectangular layouts, or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that enables asset-agnostic deployment and frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a voxelization-based evaluation capturing fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on addition and achieve superior human-perceived quality on full scene synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures (incl. appendix)</p></details> |

In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

They resist knowledge injection via fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training. However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs, evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal gains. Inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing its performance gap with dLLMs. We further show that the masked fine-tuning paradigm of arLLMs can be extended to the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of mathematical capability. Across two models and two datasets, our masked SFT outperforms regular SFT.</p></details> |  |

To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24% tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy, and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems innovations in diffusion decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, NeurIPS 2025 Efficient Reasoning Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Masked Diffusion Models as Energy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13866v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition. This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masks Can Be Distracting: On Context Comprehension in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21338v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Diffusion Objectives: Reweighted Losses are Better Variational Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19664v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a new theoretical interpretation of the reweighted losses that are widely used for training diffusion models. Our method is based on constructing a cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on the data log-likelihood, that provably improves upon the standard evidence lower bound and results in reduced data-model KL-divergences. Combining such bounds gives rise to reweighted objectives that can be applied to any generative diffusion model including both continuous Gaussian diffusion and masked (discrete) diffusion models. Then, we showcase this framework in masked diffusion and report significant improvements over previous training losses in pixel-space image modeling, approaching sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models. Our results also provide a theoretical justification for the simple weighting scheme widely used in masked image models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Learned-Order Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19152v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for generative modeling over discrete domains. It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS 2025 Workshop on Principles of Generative Modeling (PriGM)</p></details> |
| **[Breaking the Bottleneck with DiffuApriel: High-Throughput Diffusion LMs with Mamba Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15927v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Bringing Stability to Diffusion: Decomposing and Reducing Variance of Training Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18159v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs), but they suffer from inherently much higher training variance. High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindRec: A Diffusion-driven Coarse-to-Fine Paradigm for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12597v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model-based recommendation systems often represent items as text or semantic IDs and generate recommendations in an auto-regressive manner. However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance. The implementation is available via https://github.com/Mr-Peach0301/MindRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Powerful Ways to Generate: Autoregression, Diffusion, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06190v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to autoregressive language models. Beyond next-token generation, they are more efficient and flexible by enabling parallel and any-order token generation. However, despite empirical successes, their computational power and fundamental limitations remain poorly understood. In this paper, we formally study whether non-autoregressive generation in Masked Diffusion Models (MDM) enables solving problems beyond the reach of Auto-Regressive Models (ARM). Our results show that MDM with sufficiently large context length is computationally universal with decoding steps matching the optimal parallel time complexity in PRAM. However, when controlling for other factors, MDM's flexibility to generate in any-order does not expand what ARM can already solve. To address this, we propose a new form of generation called any-process generation, which extends MDM with capabilities to remask, insert and delete tokens, allowing self-correction, length-variable editing, and adaptive parallelism. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate these capabilities enable scalability to significantly harder reasoning problems that are otherwise intractable for ARM and vanilla MDM. Additionally, they prove essential for generation tasks where objects naturally evolve through non-sequential processes, crucial for extending current LLMs beyond natural language to domains such as coding and science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However, there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory of univariate function approximation. By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely, its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Physics-informed DeepCT: Sinogram Wavelet Decomposition Meets Masked Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09935v3)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model shows remarkable potential on sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction. However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</p></details> |  |

We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.

However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers. We further validate KLASS across diverse domains, including text, image, and molecular generation, showing its effectiveness as a broadly applicable sampler across different models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight.

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework.

| **[Remasking Discrete Diffusion Models with Inference-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00307v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion.

| **[Reinforcing the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought with Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10446v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT), a reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, fixed cleveref-related issue</p></details> |

During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings).

| **[CANDI: Hybrid Discrete-Continuous Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22510v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE) relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators.

However, a key limitation of standard masked diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational inference into masked diffusion.

However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models (USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings where training involves repeated passes over limited data and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. Finally, we explain why diffusion models excel in this regime: their randomized masking objective implicitly trains over a rich distribution of token orderings, acting as an implicit data augmentation that AR's fixed left-to-right factorization lacks. Our results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

This means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates. We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing. Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to 16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation (one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters, mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement, suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong alignment performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+7 appendix), 7 figures.

| **[No Compute Left Behind: Rethinking Reasoning and Sampling with Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19990v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models. Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2) multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks, any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance. At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces. Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second, we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Masked and Unmasked: Discrete Diffusion Models via Partial Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18495v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence. Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps; consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM (21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58), without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable to leading continuous generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025.

At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields (MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule, generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft-Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17206v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.</p></details> |  |

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report. 40 pages, Inference speedup analysis added</p></details> |

We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are provided on https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DiSTAR_demo.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13117v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Masked Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11462v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the significant benefits of our unified approach.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaDA 1.5: Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization for Large Language Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19223v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO), a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA, and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code (HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard +4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-1.5-Demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partition Generative Modeling: Masked Modeling Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18883v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked generative models (MGMs) are widely used to capture complex data and enable faster generation than autoregressive models (AR) through parallel decoding. However, MGMs typically operate on fixed-length inputs, which can be inefficient: early in sampling, most tokens are masked and carry no information, leading to wasted computation. In contrast, AR models process only tokens generated previously, making early iterations faster. In this work, we introduce the Partition Generative Model (PGM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of AR and MGMs. Rather than masking, PGM partitions tokens into two groups and employs sparse attention to block information flow between them. Since there is no information flow between partitions, the model can process the previously-generated tokens only during sampling, while retaining the ability to generate tokens in parallel and in any order. On OpenWebText, PGMs offer at least $5\times$ improvements in sampling latency and throughput, while producing samples with superior Generative Perplexity, compared to Masked Diffusion Language Models. On ImageNet, PGMs achieve a $7.5\times$ higher throughput than MaskGIT, with only a slight increase in FID (5.54 vs. 5.35). With twice as many sampling steps, the FID reduces to 4.56 while while being $3.9\times$ faster than MaskGIT. Finally, PGMs integrate seamlessly with MGM distillation, providing further inference speedups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Star-Shaped Masked Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08369v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost, particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios. In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit Reference Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05725v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules (e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically, we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically, across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Self-Speculative Masked Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03929v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present self-speculative masked diffusions, a new class of masked diffusion generative models for discrete data that require significantly fewer function evaluations to generate samples. Standard masked diffusion models predict factorized logits over currently masked positions. A number of masked positions are then sampled, however, the factorization approximation means that sampling too many positions in one go leads to poor sample quality. As a result, many simulation steps and therefore neural network function evaluations are required to generate high-quality data. We reduce the computational burden by generating non-factorized predictions over masked positions. This is achieved by modifying the final transformer attention mask from non-causal to causal, enabling draft token generation and parallel validation via a novel, model-integrated speculative sampling mechanism. This results in a non-factorized predictive distribution over masked positions in a single forward pass. We apply our method to GPT2 scale text modelling and protein sequences generation, finding that we can achieve a ~2x reduction in the required number of network forward passes relative to standard masked diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Additionally, by integrating a shortcut loss into our training process, we achieve rapid generation of high-quality audio samples in as few as eight sampling steps, paving the way for near-real-time applications without requiring dedicated fine-tuning or retraining. We demonstrate that SALSA-V significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both audiovisual alignment and synchronization with video content in quantitative evaluation and a human listening study. Furthermore, our use of random masking during training enables our model to match spectral characteristics of reference audio samples, broadening its applicability to professional audio synthesis tasks such as Foley generation and sound design.</p></details> |  |

Existing block-wise training methods offer means to alleviate this problem, but they rely on ad-hoc local objectives and remain largely unexplored beyond classification tasks. We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a principled framework for transforming transformer-based networks into genuinely independent trainable blocks that maintain competitive performance with end-to-end training. Our key insight leverages the fact that residual connections naturally correspond to updates in a dynamical system. With minimal modifications to this system, we can convert the updates to those of a denoising process, where each block can be learned independently by leveraging the score matching objective. This independence enables training with gradients for only one block at a time, thereby reducing memory requirements in proportion to the number of blocks. Our experiments on a range of transformer architectures (vision, diffusion, autoregressive, recurrent-depth, and masked diffusion) demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks training matches the performance of end-to-end training while enabling scalable block-wise training on practical tasks beyond small-scale classification. DiffusionBlocks provides a theoretically grounded approach that successfully scales to modern generative tasks across diverse architectures.</p></details> | Under review |

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.</p></details> | Preprint |

We first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

However, these models are unable to correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training, where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and remask them. This alternating ($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$) process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Masking Diffusion Works: Condition on the Jump Schedule for Improved Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08316v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice, however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is, surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that outperform masking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Neurips 2025.

| **[Tree Reward-Aligned Search for TReASURe in Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23146v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges: (i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration, and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i) UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs (number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution. Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21912v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However, such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model, leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks. The code is available through https://github.com/WanZhengyan/Discrete-Guidance-Matching/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity Theory of Masked Discrete Diffusion: From $\mathrm{poly}(1/ε)$ to Nearly $ε$-Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21835v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1) overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler samplers can achieve $ε$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with $\tilde{O}(d^{2}ε^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU) approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $ε$-free complexity of $O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-ε^2))$. This result surpasses existing uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the $\ln(1/ε)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based language models developed under masking paradigm.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only (Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of 0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.</p></details> | 31 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Paper (Long)</p></details> |

Prior methods combining autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts, which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine, jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and multi-objective molecular generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inpainting-Guided Policy Optimization for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10396v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as promising alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, offering competitive performance while supporting unique generation capabilities such as inpainting. We explore how inpainting can inform RL algorithm design for dLLMs. Aligning LLMs with reinforcement learning faces an exploration challenge: sparse reward signals and sample waste when models fail to discover correct solutions. While this inefficiency affects LLMs broadly, dLLMs offer a distinctive opportunity--their inpainting ability can guide exploration. We introduce IGPO (Inpainting Guided Policy Optimization), an RL framework that strategically inserts partial ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling. Unlike providing full solutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces while preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such as GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO restores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also propose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that better align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques including entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains across three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new state-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs.</p></details> | preprint; 21 pages |

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Any-Order Flexible Length Masked Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01025v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations. To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference. Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve $\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance ($52\% \to 65\%$).</p></details> | Preprint |

We evaluate our method on the BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05755v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.

In this work, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial detection and purification framework based on a \textit{text-conditioned masked diffusion model}. During training, MDD applies partial masking to Mel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion process, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process then reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input transcription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial examples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD achieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, including both diffusion-based and neural codec-based approaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated speech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those observed under clean conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based masking strategies for secure and reliable speaker verification systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by APSIPA ASC 2025</p></details> |

Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling (PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with state-of-the-art autoregressive models.

This can be attributed to its scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative to autoregressive language models.

The sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD) framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift. ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task, confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures |

Existing approaches typically follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas; second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning, a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods. Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion modeling.</p></details> |  |

LLaDA-MedV achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks: 84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the interplay between sampling steps and response repetition.

| **[Plan for Speed: Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-AD: Masked Diffusion for Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16943v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying injuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies. The code is available at hhttps://github.com/farzad-bz/MAD-AD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model for Imaging Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16579v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

| **[ReDiSC: A Reparameterized Masked Diffusion Model for Scalable Node Classification with Structured Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14484v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved unprecedented successes in node classification tasks. Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06203v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

| **[DiffuCoder: Understanding and Improving Masked Diffusion Models for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20639v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR bias during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.</p></details> | minor update |
| **[Any-Order GPT as Masked Diffusion Model: Decoupling Formulation and Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19935v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR) approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space, decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for future model design.

| **[Quality-aware Masked Diffusion Transformer for Enhanced Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15863v4)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-music (TTM) generation, which converts textual descriptions into audio, opens up innovative avenues for multimedia creation. Achieving high quality and diversity in this process demands extensive, high-quality data, which are often scarce in available datasets. Most open-source datasets frequently suffer from issues like low-quality waveforms and low text-audio consistency, hindering the advancement of music generation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel quality-aware training paradigm for generating high-quality, high-musicality music from large-scale, quality-imbalanced datasets. Additionally, by leveraging unique properties in the latent space of musical signals, we adapt and implement a masked diffusion transformer (MDT) model for the TTM task, showcasing its capacity for quality control and enhanced musicality. Furthermore, we introduce a three-stage caption refinement approach to address low-quality captions' issue. Experiments show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets including MusicCaps and the Song-Describer Dataset with both objective and subjective metrics. Demo audio samples are available at https://qa-mdt.github.io/, code and pretrained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/ivcylc/OpenMusic.</p></details> | IJCAI |

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In other words, this approach samples from non-convex spaces defined as convex sets with convex holes. This defines a novel and challenging problem in constrained sampling. To do so, the sampler incorporates a combination of a spatially adaptive temperature and a repulsive drift to ensure that samples remain within the feasible region. Experiments on a 2D Gaussian mixture and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbol detection showcase the advantages of the proposed shielded LMC in contrast to unconstrained cases.</p></details> |  |

At the moment, there is only one test suggested that relies upon random projections. We propose a novel test termed α-Energy Based Test (α-EBT) to compare the multivariate distributions of two (or more) compositional data sets. Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measurement-Constrained Sampling for Text-Prompted Blind Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14213v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoveOD: Synthesizing Origin-Destination Commute Distribution from U.S. Census Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18858v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution origin-destination (OD) tables are essential for a wide spectrum of transportation applications, from modeling traffic and signal timing optimization to congestion pricing and vehicle routing. However, outside a handful of data rich cities, such data is rarely available. We introduce MOVEOD, an open-source pipeline that synthesizes public data into commuter OD flows with fine-grained spatial and temporal departure times for any county in the United States. MOVEOD combines five open data sources: American Community Survey (ACS) departure time and travel time distributions, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES) residence-to-workplace flows, county geometries, road network information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), and building footprints from OSM and Microsoft, into a single OD dataset. We use a constrained sampling and integer-programming method to reconcile the OD dataset with data from ACS and LODES. Our approach involves: (1) matching commuter totals per origin zone, (2) aligning workplace destinations with employment distributions, and (3) calibrating travel durations to ACS-reported commute times. This ensures the OD data accurately reflects commuting patterns. We demonstrate the framework on Hamilton County, Tennessee, where we generate roughly 150,000 synthetic trips in minutes, which we feed into a benchmark suite of classical and learning-based vehicle-routing algorithms. The MOVEOD pipeline is an end-to-end automated system, enabling users to easily apply it across the United States by giving only a county and a year; and it can be adapted to other countries with comparable census datasets. The source code and a lightweight browser interface are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures (including 3 validation charts and 1 map visualization).

| **[SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample-then-Filter in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Dikin-Langevin diffusion for polyhedra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04582v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interior-point geometry offers a straightforward approach to constrained sampling and optimization on polyhedra, eliminating reflections and ad hoc projections. We exploit the Dikin log-barrier to define a Dikin--Langevin diffusion whose drift and noise are modulated by the inverse barrier Hessian. In continuous time, we establish a boundary no-flux property; trajectories started in the interior remain in $U$ almost surely, so feasibility is maintained by construction. For computation, we adopt a discretize-then-correct design: an Euler--Maruyama proposal with state-dependent covariance, followed by a Metropolis--Hastings correction that targets the exact constrained law and reduces to a Dikin random walk when $f$ is constant. Numerically, the unadjusted diffusion exhibits the expected first-order step size bias, while the MH-adjusted variant delivers strong convergence diagnostics on anisotropic, box-constrained Gaussians (rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ concentrated near $1$) and higher inter-well transition counts on a bimodal target, indicating superior cross-well mobility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that coupling calibrated stochasticity with interior-point preconditioning provides a practical, reflection-free approach to sampling and optimization over polyhedral domains, offering clear advantages near faces, corners, and in nonconvex landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |

However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |

However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Non-Reversible Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11743v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution on a constrained domain. We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |
| **[A Novel Constrained Sampling Method for Efficient Exploration in Materials and Chemical Mixture Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient exploration of multicomponent material composition spaces is often limited by time and financial constraints, particularly when mixture and synthesis constraints exist. Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>feedb...</summary><p>feedback welcome, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the Rényi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

| **[Quantum Algorithms for Weighted Constrained Sampling and Weighted Model Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12816v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problems of weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, where we are given a propositional formula and a weight for each world. The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $Ω(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $Θ(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $Θ(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |

This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

| **[Unbiased constrained sampling with Self-Concordant Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11925v3)** | 2023-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $π$ on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $π$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |
| **[Black-box optimization on hyper-rectangle using Recursive Modified Pattern Search and application to ROC-based Classification Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08616v4)** | 2023-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In statistics, it is common to encounter multi-modal and non-smooth likelihood (or objective function) maximization problems, where the parameters have known upper and lower bounds. This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Constrained Sampling from Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12558v2)** | 2022-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained language models generate fluent text but are notoriously hard to controllably sample from. In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01581v4)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |

However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $ε$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $ε^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points.

How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

Conditional generators are one of the successful implementations of such models wherein the created samples are constrained to a specific class. In this work, the application of these networks is extended to regression problems wherein the conditional generator is restrained to any continuous aspect of the data. A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

| **[Skim-Aware Contrastive Learning for Efficient Document Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24373v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[RainFusion2.0: Temporal-Spatial Awareness and Hardware-Efficient Block-wise Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24086v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2026 |

We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |

Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Computers.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.</p></details> | Under submission |

To address the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals, this paper proposes a multi-branch parallel architecture, where each temporal scale is equipped with an independent spatial feature extraction module. To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet. In the future, we hope that EEG-CSANet could serve as a promising baseline model in the field of EEG signal decoding.

| **[Efficient Low Rank Attention for Long-Context Inference in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23649v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the length of input text increases, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning, reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal retention of key-value pairs. In this work, Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK) is introduced, a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and then employs these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism where only missing full-precision KV pairs are transferred, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings, while delivering significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.

| **[Taming the Memory Footprint Crisis: System Design for Production Diffusion LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17077v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs), utilizing parallel decoding to overcome sequential bottlenecks. However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical "memory footprint crisis" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound "Refresh" phases and bandwidth-bound "Reuse" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\times$-1.81$\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\times$-1.74$\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trainable Log-linear Sparse Attention for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16615v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently.

We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables and 1 algorithm</p></details> |

This paper presents SMMT, a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture designed to improve efficiency and robustness. Building upon a cascaded multi-modal transformer framework, SMMT introduces cluster-based sparse attention to achieve near linear computational complexity and modality-wise masking to enhance robustness against incomplete inputs. The architecture is evaluated using Alzheimer's Disease classification on the ADNI dataset as a representative multi-modal case study. Experimental results show that SMMT maintains competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing training time, memory usage, and energy consumption compared to dense attention baselines, demonstrating its suitability as a resource-aware architectural component for scalable intelligent systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14322v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency. This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria. We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by HPCA 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Sparse Attention via Multi-Granularity Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14082v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.</p></details> |  |

It introduces a differential attention mechanism that calculates the difference between two independently generated attention distributions, effectively reducing noise and promoting sparse attention patterns. However, the independent signal generation in DIFF Transformer results in parameter redundancy and suboptimal utilization of information. In this work, we propose Shared DIFF Transformer, which draws on the idea of a differential amplifier by introducing a shared base matrix to model global patterns and incorporating low-rank updates to enhance task-specific flexibility. This design significantly reduces parameter redundancy, improves efficiency, and retains strong noise suppression capabilities. Experimental results show that, compared to DIFF Transformer, our method achieves better performance in tasks such as long-sequence modeling, key information retrieval, and in-context learning. Our work provides a novel and efficient approach to optimizing differential attention mechanisms and advancing robust Transformer architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2501.17486</p></details> |
| **[BlossomRec: Block-level Fused Sparse Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13368v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer structures have been widely used in sequential recommender systems (SRS). However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/ronineume/BlossomRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[TwinFormer: A Dual-Level Transformer for Long-Sequence Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12301v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TwinFormer is a hierarchical Transformer for long-sequence time-series forecasting. It divides the input into non-overlapping temporal patches and processes them in two stages: (1) a Local Informer with top-$k$ Sparse Attention models intra-patch dynamics, followed by mean pooling; (2) a Global Informer captures long-range inter-patch dependencies using the same top-$k$ attention. A lightweight GRU aggregates the globally contextualized patch tokens for direct multi-horizon prediction. The resulting architecture achieves linear $O(kLd)$ time and memory complexity. On eight real-world benchmarking datasets from six different domains, including weather, stock price, temperature, power consumption, electricity, and disease, and forecasting horizons $96-720$, TwinFormer secures $27$ positions in the top two out of $34$. Out of the $27$, it achieves the best performance on MAE and RMSE at $17$ places and $10$ at the second-best place on MAE and RMSE. This consistently outperforms PatchTST, iTransformer, FEDformer, Informer, and vanilla Transformers. Ablations confirm the superiority of top-$k$ Sparse Attention over ProbSparse and the effectiveness of GRU-based aggregation.

To address this challenge, we introduce BLASST, a drop-in sparse attention method that dynamically prunes the attention matrix without any pre-computation or proxy scores. Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs. Furthermore, we explore sparsity-aware training as a natural extension, showing that models can be trained to be inherently more robust to sparse attention patterns, pushing the accuracy-sparsity frontier even further.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multipole Attention for Efficient Long Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13059v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput. To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings. Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.</p></details> |  |
| **[The emergence of sparse attention: impact of data distribution and benefits of repetition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17863v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind one form of emergence.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.</p></details> |  |

However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> |

Autoregressive mesh generators serialize faces into sequences and train on truncated segments with sliding-window inference to cope with memory limits. However, this mismatch breaks long-range geometric dependencies, producing holes and fragmented components. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MeshRipple, which expands a mesh outward from an active generation frontier, akin to a ripple on a surface. MeshRipple rests on three key innovations: a frontier-aware BFS tokenization that aligns the generation order with surface topology; an expansive prediction strategy that maintains coherent, connected surface growth; and a sparse-attention global memory that provides an effectively unbounded receptive field to resolve long-range topological dependencies. This integrated design enables MeshRipple to generate meshes with high surface fidelity and topological completeness, outperforming strong recent baselines.</p></details> |  |

For a single attention distribution $P$ and its Top-$k$ truncation $\hat P$, we show that the total-variation distance coincides with the discarded softmax tail mass and satisfies $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)=1-e^{-\mathrm{KL}(\hat P\Vert P)}$, yielding sharp Top-$k$-specific bounds in place of generic inequalities. From this we derive non-asymptotic deterministic bounds -- from a single boundary gap through multi-gap and blockwise variants -- that control $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)$ using only the ordered logits. Using an exact head-tail decomposition, we prove that the output error factorizes as $\|\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\|_2=τ\|μ_{\mathrm{tail}}-μ_{\mathrm{head}}\|_2$ with $τ=\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)$, yielding a new head-tail diameter bound $\|\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\|_2\leτ\,\mathrm{diam}_{H,T}$ and refinements linking the error to $\mathrm{Var}_P(V)$. Under an i.i.d. Gaussian score model $s_i\sim\mathcal N(μ,σ^2)$ we derive closed-form tail masses and an asymptotic rule for the minimal $k_\varepsilon$ ensuring $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)\le\varepsilon$, namely $k_\varepsilon/n\approxΦ_c(σ+Φ^{-1}(\varepsilon))$. Experiments on bert-base-uncased and synthetic logits confirm the predicted scaling of $k_\varepsilon/n$ and show that certified Top-$k$ can reduce scored keys by 2-4$\times$ on average while meeting the prescribed total-variation budget.</p></details> |  |

However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[DFIR-DETR: Frequency Domain Enhancement and Dynamic Feature Aggregation for Cross-Scene Small Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07078v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting small objects in UAV remote sensing images and identifying surface defects in industrial inspection remain difficult tasks. These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily. We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency. We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Block Sparse Flash Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07011v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models increasingly require long contexts for reasoning and multi-document tasks, but attention's quadratic complexity creates a severe computational bottleneck. We present Block-Sparse FlashAttention (BSFA), a drop-in replacement that accelerates long-context inference while preserving model quality. Unlike methods that predict importance before computing scores, BSFA computes exact query-key similarities to select the top-k most important value blocks for each query. By comparing per-block maximum scores against calibrated thresholds, we skip approximately 50% of the computation and memory transfers for pruned blocks. Our training-free approach requires only a one-time threshold calibration on a small dataset to learn the per-layer and per-head attention score distributions. We provide a CUDA kernel implementation that can be used as a drop-in replacement for FlashAttention. On Llama-3.1-8B, BSFA achieves up to 1.10x speedup on real-world reasoning benchmarks and up to 1.24x for needle-in-a-haystack retrieval tasks while maintaining above 99% baseline accuracy, with certain configurations even improving accuracy by focusing on the most relevant content, substantially outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

| **[Radial Attention: $O(n\log n)$ Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19852v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

| **[Sparse Attention Post-Training for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05865v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.3 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.</p></details> |  |
| **[USV: Unified Sparsification for Accelerating Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05754v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of high-fidelity video diffusion models (VDMs) is constrained by two key sources of redundancy: the quadratic complexity of global spatio-temporal attention and the computational overhead of long iterative denoising trajectories. Existing accelerators -- such as sparse attention and step-distilled samplers -- typically target a single dimension in isolation and quickly encounter diminishing returns, as the remaining bottlenecks become dominant. In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Our results highlight unified, dynamic sparsification as a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSA: Pyramid Sparse Attention for Efficient Video Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04025v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/PSA</p></details> | Tech report |

This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.neural4d.com/research-page/textrix</p></details> |

The key technical breakthroughs of DeepSeek-V3.2 are as follows: (1) DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA): We introduce DSA, an efficient attention mechanism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance in long-context scenarios. (2) Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework: By implementing a robust reinforcement learning protocol and scaling post-training compute, DeepSeek-V3.2 performs comparably to GPT-5.

(3) Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline: To integrate reasoning into tool-use scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This methodology facilitates scalable agentic post-training, yielding substantial improvements in generalization and instruction-following robustness within complex, interactive environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVGGT: Rethinking Global Attention for Accelerating VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02541v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we significantly reduce this efficiency gap by proving that any $(t(n),s(n))$-bounded multi-tape TM can be simulated by a constant bit-size Transformer with an optimal $O(s(n))$-long context window and only $O(s(n)^c)$ CoT steps per TM step, where $c>0$ can be made arbitrarily small by letting the Transformers' head-layer product sufficiently large. In addition, our construction shows that sparse attention with fixed geometric offsets suffices for efficient universal computation. Our proof leverages multi-queue TMs as a bridge. The main technical novelty is a more efficient simulation of multi-tape TMs by synchronous multi-queue TMs, improving both time and space complexity under stricter model assumptions.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Accelerating Large-Scale Reasoning Model Inference with Sparse Self-Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01278v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth. To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism.

Consequently, existing remote sensing image super-resolution methods often face a trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery, named HIMOSA. Specifically, HIMOSA leverages the inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery and introduces a content-aware sparse attention mechanism, enabling the model to achieve fast inference while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Furthermore, to effectively leverage the multi-scale repetitive patterns found in remote sensing imagery, we introduce a hierarchical window expansion and reduce the computational complexity by adjusting the sparsity of the attention. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We argue that this requires three key properties: \textbf{sparsity}, \textbf{random-access flexibility}, and \textbf{length generalization}. To address ultra-long-context modeling, we leverage Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA), a novel attention mechanism that satisfies all three properties. We integrate HSA into Transformers to build HSA-UltraLong, which is an 8B-parameter MoE model trained on over 8 trillion tokens and is rigorously evaluated on different tasks with in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths to demonstrate its capability in handling ultra-long contexts. Results show that our model performs comparably to full-attention baselines on in-domain lengths while achieving over 90\% accuracy on most in-context retrieval tasks with contexts up to 16M. This report outlines our experimental insights and open problems, contributing a foundation for future research in ultra-long context modeling.</p></details> |  |

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

| **[Making Every Head Count: Sparse Attention Without the Speed-Performance Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09596v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of O(H N^2) that grows quadratically with the context size (N) and linearly with the number of heads (H). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from H independent O(N^2) computations into a single, collaborative O(N^2) computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of H. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Our work demonstrates that thoughtfully designed structural sparsity can serve as an effective inductive bias that simultaneously improves both computational efficiency and model performance, opening a new avenue for the architectural design of next-generation, high-performance LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20102v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.</p></details> | 28 pages |

We introduce a hybrid implicit-explicit representation that fuses neural fields with Gaussian primitives to jointly capture global structural priors and locally observed details. Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement. The planning module formulates next-best-view selection as an Expected Hybrid Information Gain problem and incorporates a risk-sensitive path planner to ensure efficient and safe exploration. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and rendering quality, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world active reconstruction and robotic perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn</p></details> |

However, attention matrices are mostly sparse, which implies that many entries may be omitted from computation for efficient inference. Sparse attention inference methods aim to reduce this computational burden; however, they also come with a troublesome performance degradation. We discover that one reason for this degradation is that the sparse calculation induces a distributional shift in the attention outputs. The distributional shift causes decoding-time queries to fail to align well with the appropriate keys from the prefill stage, leading to a drop in performance. We propose a simple, novel, and effective procedure for correcting this distributional shift, bringing the distribution of sparse attention outputs closer to that of quadratic attention. Our method can be applied on top of any sparse attention method, and results in an average 36%pt performance increase, recovering 88% of quadratic attention accuracy on the 131K RULER benchmark when applied on top of sliding window attention with sink tokens while only adding a small overhead. Our method can maintain approximately 98.5% sparsity over full quadratic attention, making our model 32 times faster than Flash Attention 2 when processing 1M token prefills.</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

| **[OmniSparse: Training-Aware Fine-Grained Sparse Attention for Long-Video MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12201v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing sparse attention methods primarily target inference-time acceleration by selecting critical tokens under predefined sparsity patterns. However, they often fail to bridge the training-inference gap and lack the capacity for fine-grained token selection across multiple dimensions such as queries, key-values (KV), and heads, leading to suboptimal performance and limited acceleration gains. In this paper, we introduce OmniSparse, a training-aware fine-grained sparse attention framework for long-video MLLMs, which operates in both training and inference with dynamic token budget allocation. Specifically, OmniSparse contains three adaptive and complementary mechanisms: (1) query selection via lazy-active classification, retaining active queries that capture broad semantic similarity while discarding most lazy ones that focus on limited local context and exhibit high functional redundancy; (2) KV selection with head-level dynamic budget allocation, where a shared budget is determined based on the flattest head and applied uniformly across all heads to ensure attention recall; and (3) KV cache slimming to reduce head-level redundancy by selectively fetching visual KV cache according to the head-level decoding query pattern. Experimental results show that OmniSparse matches the performance of full attention while achieving up to 2.7x speedup during prefill and 2.4x memory reduction during decoding.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |

To address this issue, we propose a High-Frequency Guided Diffusion Network based on Wavelet Decomposition (HDW-SR), which replaces the conventional U-Net backbone in diffusion frameworks. Specifically, we perform diffusion only on the residual map, allowing the network to focus more effectively on high-frequency information restoration. We then introduce wavelet-based downsampling in place of standard CNN downsampling to achieve multi-scale frequency decomposition, enabling sparse cross-attention between the high-frequency subbands of the pre-super-resolved image and the low-frequency subbands of the diffused image for explicit high-frequency guidance. Moreover, a Dynamic Thresholding Block (DTB) is designed to refine high-frequency selection during the sparse attention process. During upsampling, the invertibility of the wavelet transform ensures low-loss feature reconstruction. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that HDW-SR achieves competitive super-resolution performance, excelling particularly in recovering fine-grained image details. The code will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02124v6)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. The community has proposed sparse attention to mitigate this issue. However, position-aware sparse attention methods rely on static sparse structures that lack adaptability to diverse query contexts, while content-aware sparse attention methods depend on heuristic key-value selection, hindering full differentiability. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, a method that merges the advantages of both position-aware and content-aware approaches. Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) achieves this through three key innovations: First, it leverages value vector representations to generate content-aware dynamic masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and attend to critical information. Second, it computes position-aware sparse weights in a hardware-friendly manner, efficiently skipping unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduced dynamic mask and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, supporting end-to-end training. We have validated the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. A large body of experimental evidence shows that DMA consistently holds a Pareto advantage over state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines in tasks including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, standard benchmarks, and needle in a haystack tests, while also delivering up to a 10x overall speedup. These results highlight its ability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling capabilities. Our computational kernel code is now open-source at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to encourage further research and application by the community.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, existing methods are limited by Fa}lse Negatives (FaNe) induced by semantically similar texts and insufficient fine-grained cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose FaNe, a semantic-enhanced VLP framework. To mitigate false negatives, we introduce a semantic-aware positive pair mining strategy based on text-text similarity with adaptive normalization. Furthermore, we design a text-conditioned sparse attention pooling module to enable fine-grained image-text alignment through localized visual representations guided by textual cues. To strengthen intra-modal discrimination, we develop a hard-negative aware contrastive loss that adaptively reweights semantically similar negatives. Extensive experiments on five downstream medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FaNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, validating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[LiteAttention: A Temporal Sparse Attention for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11062v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems 2025 (ICPADS 2025 Oral)</p></details> |

This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication at IEEE Computer Architecture Letters (IEEE CAL), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02818v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However, current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by 12.0 points on AIME 24, 8.6 on GPQA, and 9.7 on LiveCodeBench on average for an equivalent number of memory reads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[An End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05265v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover, compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the total training time required while achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in training efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We propose FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mustafar: Promoting Unstructured Sparsity for KV Cache Pruning in LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22913v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference.

Traditional beamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under adverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an alternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel environments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their ability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However, their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids. Recent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns that disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for wireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware Sparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that incorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure is configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is theoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the number of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel conditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a fixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional beamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios, while maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys per query.</p></details> |  |

Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $<10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(ε\in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes. This architecture provides a scalable scenario of 500 UAVs with a collision rate of $< 2.0\%$ and the Byzantine fault tolerance of $f < n/3$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and scheduled for conference presentation</p></details> |

However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention (FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local self-attention over their own token representations while periodically exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

A key insight is that alternating between local (sliding-window) and global (compression, selective) attention across layers, rather than using fixed patterns, enables more effective propagation of long-range dependencies and substantially boosts performance on long-sequence tasks. Meanwhile, we further refine NSA's branches with Latent Attention that the sliding-window branch is enhanced with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) while compression and selective branches adopt Group-head Latent Attention (GLA). These changes reduce KV-cache memory by 50\% versus NSA while improving the model's common-sense reasoning and long-text understanding capabilities. Experiments on models from 340M to 1.3B parameters (trained on 15B and 100B tokens) show our method matches or exceeds full attention and native sparse attention in both common-sense reasoning and long-context understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, RNNs are fundamentally unable to randomly access historical context, and simply integrating attention mechanisms may undermine their efficiency advantages. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA), a novel attention mechanism that enhances RNNs with long-range random access flexibility while preserving their merits in efficiency and length generalization. HSA divides inputs into chunks, selects the top-$k$ chunks and hierarchically aggregates information. The core innovation lies in learning token-to-chunk relevance based on fine-grained token-level information inside each chunk. This approach enhances the precision of chunk selection across both in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths. To make HSA efficient, we further introduce a hardware-aligned kernel design. By combining HSA with Mamba, we introduce RAMba, which achieves perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval across 64 million contexts despite pre-training on only 4K-length contexts, and significant improvements on various downstream tasks, with nearly constant memory footprint.

We introduce SpecAttn, a novel training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Structured Probabilistic Inference & Generative Modeling</p></details> |

The quadratic complexity in attention and autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV) cache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts have attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less important tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to estimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly compute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse attention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information structure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream KV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a plug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache compression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully compatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower layer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache, enabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have designed a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically tailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines spatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency of KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal redundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the prefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2, Qwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and 3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.</p></details> |  |

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.</p></details> | <details><summary>autho...</summary><p>author comment: This version was previously removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission.

| **[Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for On-Device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24606v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

| **[SALS: Sparse Attention in Latent Space for KV cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24273v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSA: Faster Video Diffusion with Trainable Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13389v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.

However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration.

| **[Alleviating Forgetfulness of Linear Attention by Hybrid Sparse Attention and Contextualized Learnable Token Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20787v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks. To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly, we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Sparser Block-Sparse Attention via Token Permutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21270v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area.

| **[Spark Transformer: Reactivating Sparsity in FFN and Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06644v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where the vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive for each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for enhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in translating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved away from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing efforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality, increase parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention, the application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces similar challenges. This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that achieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention mechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard training procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for explicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical top-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that avoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard top-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN parameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for identifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from enforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the Gemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN neurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This sparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time speedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000 tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning 97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput while preserving model accuracy.

Our work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

Since attention is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps, with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

However, such extended contexts exacerbate the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value (KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections. Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to 8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences. Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Xihe: Scalable Zero-Shot Time Series Learner Via Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21795v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of HIBA.</p></details> |  |

While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions: (1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training.</p></details> | 56 pages |

While key-value (KV) cache eviction and sparse attention algorithms have been proposed for efficient LLM inference in plaintext, they are not designed for MPC and cannot benefit private LLM inference directly. In this paper, we propose an accurate and MPC-friendly KV cache eviction framework, dubbed MPCache, building on the observation that historical tokens in a long sequence may have different effects on the downstream decoding. Hence, MPCache combines a look-once static eviction algorithm to discard unimportant KV cache and a query-aware dynamic selection algorithm to activate only a small subset of KV cache for attention computation. MPCache further incorporates a series of optimizations for efficient dynamic KV cache selection, including MPC-friendly similarity approximation, hierarchical KV cache clustering, and cross-layer index-sharing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPCache consistently outperforms prior-art KV cache eviction baselines across different generation tasks and achieves 1.8 ~ 2.01x and 3.39 ~ 8.37x decoding latency and communication reduction on different sequence lengths, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).</p></details> | Preprint |

Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models.
