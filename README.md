| **[A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |

By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making. Our method offers concrete evidence that neural networks can directly capture and exploit combinatorial structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing for Minimum Bisection Problem: A Machine Learning-based Approach for Penalty Parameter Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19005v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Minimum Bisection Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, with practical applications in areas such as parallel computing, network design, and machine learning. In this paper, we examine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to solve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation lies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the problem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter. Specifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict suitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input graph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the penalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem instance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of minimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions. We test our approach on a large dataset of randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with up to 4,000 nodes, and we compare the results with classical partitioning algorithms, Metis and Kernighan-Lin. Experimental findings demonstrate that our adaptive tuning strategy significantly improves the performance of the quantum annealing hybrid solver and consistently outperforms the classical methods used, indicating its potential as an alternative for the graph partitioning problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Network Slice Placement with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18545v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities, with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within 7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network slice placement in heterogeneous infrastructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic coherence-driven inference on arguments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18523v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inconsistencies are ubiquitous in law, administration, and jurisprudence. Though a cure is too much to hope for, we propose a technological remedy. Large language models (LLMs) can accurately extract propositions from arguments and compile them into natural data structures that enable coherence-driven inference (CDI) via combinatorial optimization. This neurosymbolic architecture naturally separates concerns and enables meaningful judgments about the coherence of arguments that can inform legislative and policy analysis and legal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Data Mining and AI for Law (https://dmail-workshop.github.io/DMAIL2025/)</p></details> |
| **[Gödel Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18383v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Coordination for Evolving Multi-agent Systems: A Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18088v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06253v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: f...</summary><p>v2: fixed spelling Bhattacharya->Bhattacharyya on title page</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as End-to-end Combinatorial Optimization Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16865v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to decision-making scenarios like logistics and manufacturing, are traditionally solved using problem-specific algorithms requiring significant domain expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating CO problem solving, existing approaches rely on intermediate steps such as code generation or solver invocation, limiting their generality and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that empowers LLMs to serve as end-to-end CO solvers by directly mapping natural language problem descriptions to solutions. We propose a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) imparts LLMs with solution generation patterns from domain-specific solvers, while a feasibility-and-optimality-aware reinforcement learning (FOARL) process explicitly mitigates constraint violations and refines solution quality. Evaluation across seven NP-hard CO problems shows that our method achieves a high feasibility rate and reduces the average optimality gap to 1.03-8.20% by tuning a 7B-parameter LLM, surpassing both general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and domain-specific heuristics. Our method establishes a unified language-based pipeline for CO without extensive code execution or manual architectural adjustments for different problems, offering a general and language-driven alternative to traditional solver design while maintaining relative feasibility guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06126v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. In many applications, one has to repeatedly solve VRP instances drawn from the same distribution, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce an optimization framework where a reinforcement learning agent is trained on prior instances and quickly generates initial solutions, which are then further optimized by a genetic algorithm. This framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time budgets. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within one second, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling real-time and interactive routing at scale. EARLI can generalize to new data, as we demonstrate on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. By combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, our hybrid framework takes a step forward to closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem. In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block Encoding of Sparse Matrices via Coherent Permutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21667v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variables Ordering Optimization in Boolean Characteristic Set Method Using Simulated Annealing and Machine Learning-based Time Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14754v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving systems of Boolean equations is a fundamental task in symbolic computation and algebraic cryptanalysis, with wide-ranging applications in cryptography, coding theory, and formal verification. Among existing approaches, the Boolean Characteristic Set (BCS) method[1] has emerged as one of the most efficient algorithms for tackling such problems. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the ordering of variables, with solving times varying drastically under different orderings for fixed variable counts n and equations size m. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel optimization framework that synergistically integrates machine learning (ML)-based time prediction with simulated annealing (SA) to efficiently identify high-performance variables orderings. Weconstruct a dataset comprising variable frequency spectrum X and corresponding BCS solving time t for benchmark systems(e.g., n = m = 28). Utilizing this data, we train an accurate ML predictor ft(X) to estimate solving time for any given variables ordering. For each target system, ft serves as the cost function within an SA algorithm, enabling rapid discovery of low-latency orderings that significantly expedite subsequent BCS execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms the standard BCS algorithm[1], Gr\"obner basis method [2] and SAT solver[3], particularly for larger-scale systems(e.g., n = 32). Furthermore, we derive probabilistic time complexity bounds for the overall algorithm using stochastic process theory, establishing a quantitative relationship between predictor accuracy and expected solving complexity. This work provides both a practical acceleration tool for algebraic cryptanalysis and a theoretical foundation for ML-enhanced combinatorial optimization in symbolic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00364v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in quantum computing have spurred substantial research into the application of quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) emerges as a classic and critical paradigm in the field. For a graph G(V, E), TDP entails finding a minimal subset D subset of V that contains no isolated vertices, where every vertex not in D has at least one neighbor in D. TDP finds extensive applications across domains such as computer networks, social networks, and communications. Since the latter half of the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing solution algorithms, which have become foundational to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to TDP remains largely underexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse set of parameters. This paper proves that the upper bound on the number of qubits required to solve TDP is 2|V| + |V| log_2( (2|E|)/|V| - 1 ). Our experimental findings demonstrate that QAOA is effective in addressing TDP: under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes a valid total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for solving TDP and lays a solid groundwork for future investigations in this area.</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.</p></details> | 36 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Learn to Relax with Large Language Models: Solving Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems via Bidirectional Coevolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12643v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability. While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated \textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We wish to withdraw this manuscript as we have identified several technical details that require further optimization and refinement.

| **[JoPA:Explaining Large Language Model's Generation via Joint Prompt Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20404v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models in Many-to-One Matching Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13131v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Location and allocation problem of high-speed train maintenance bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13383v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintenance bases are crucial for the safe and stable operation of high-speed trains, necessitating significant financial investment for their construction and operation. Planning the location and task allocation of these bases in the vast high-speed railway network is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This paper explored the strategic planning of identifying optimal locations for maintenance bases, introducing a bi-level programming model. The upper-level objective was to minimize the annualized total cost, including investment for new or expanding bases and total maintenance costs, while the lower-level focused on dispatching high-speed trains to the most suitable base for maintenance tasks, thereby reducing maintenance operation dispatch costs under various investment scenarios. A case study of the Northwest China high-speed rail network demonstrated the application of this model, and included the sensitivity analysis reflecting maintenance policy reforms. The results showed that establishing a new base in Hami and expanding Xi'an base could minimize the total annualized cost during the planning period, amounting to a total of 2,278.15 million RMB. This paper offers an optimization method for selecting maintenance base locations that ensures reliability and efficiency in maintenance work as the number of trains increases in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Branch-and-Bound Algorithms as Polynomial-time Approximation Schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15885v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Branch-and-bound algorithms (B&B) and polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) are two seemingly distant areas of combinatorial optimization. We intend to (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of theoretical knowledge on the B\&B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms typically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we show that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack and scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly better solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by computational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods. This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at ICALP 2025</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Boolean Function Learnability on Deep Neural Networks: PAC Learning Meets Neurosymbolic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05908v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational learning theory states that many classes of boolean formulas are learnable in polynomial time. This paper addresses the understudied subject of how, in practice, such formulas can be learned by deep neural networks. Specifically, we analyze boolean formulas associated with model-sampling benchmarks, combinatorial optimization problems, and random 3-CNFs with varying degrees of constrainedness. Our experiments indicate that: (i) neural learning generalizes better than pure rule-based systems and pure symbolic approach; (ii) relatively small and shallow neural networks are very good approximators of formulas associated with combinatorial optimization problems; (iii) smaller formulas seem harder to learn, possibly due to the fewer positive (satisfying) examples available; and (iv) interestingly, underconstrained 3-CNF formulas are more challenging to learn than overconstrained ones. Such findings pave the way for a better understanding, construction, and use of interpretable neurosymbolic AI methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted for NeSy 2025</p></details> |

Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed. In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers. Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</p></details> |  |

The model targets combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order and addresses fundamental limitations of previous OIM models through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance. This work strengthens both the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of oscillator-based Ising machines for complex optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

| **[REMS: a unified solution representation, problem modeling and metaheuristic algorithm design for general combinatorial optimization problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17108v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn for substantial modifications in the method and the experiment</p></details> |

This work introduces a novel class of classical probabilistic circuits designed for generating approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems constructed using two-bit stochastic matrices. Through a numerical study, we investigate the performance of our proposed variational circuits in solving the Max-Cut problem on various graphs of increasing sizes. Our classical algorithm demonstrates improved performance for several graph types to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Our findings suggest that evaluating the performance of quantum variational circuits against variational circuits with sub-universal gate sets is a valuable benchmark for identifying areas where quantum variational circuits can excel.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Generalizing Beyond Suboptimality: Offline Reinforcement Learning Learns Effective Scheduling through Random Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10303v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), are canonical combinatorial optimization problems with wide-ranging applications in industrial operations. In recent years, many online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20 training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority dispatching rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Robust Anti-jamming Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10280v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS), deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), could enhance anti-jamming communication performance by dynamically configuring channel conditions and establishing reliable air-ground links. However, large-scale ARIS faces critical deployment challenges due to the prohibitive computational complexity of conventional discrete optimization methods and sophisticated jamming threats. In this paper, we introduce a mean field modeling approach to design the spatial configuration of ARIS by a continuous density function, thus bypassing high-dimensional combinatorial optimization. We consider an adaptive jammer which adjusts its position and beamforming to minimize the sum-rate. A key finding reveals that the jammer's optimal strategy is governed by a proximity-directivity trade-off between reducing path loss and enhancing spatial focusing. To combat the jamming, we propose a robust anti-jamming transmission framework that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, the ARIS reflection, and the ARIS spatial distribution to maximize the worst-case sum-rate. By leveraging variational optimization and Riemannian manifold methods, we efficiently solve the functional optimization problems. Our analysis further unveils that the optimal ARIS deployment follows a spatial water-filling principle, concentrating resources in high-gain regions while avoiding interference-prone areas. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably improves the sum-rate. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of UAVs, validating its effectiveness for scalable ARIS-assisted anti-jamming communications.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Toward Minimum Graphic Parity Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10070v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits composed of CNOT and $R_z$ are fundamental building blocks of many quantum algorithms, so optimizing the synthesis of such quantum circuits is crucial. We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to $m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m + O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class. Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Play Combinatorial Semi-Bandit Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09933v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the combinatorial semi-bandit (CSB) problem, a player selects an action from a combinatorial action set and observes feedback from the base arms included in the action. While CSB is widely applicable to combinatorial optimization problems, its restriction to binary decision spaces excludes important cases involving non-negative integer flows or allocations, such as the optimal transport and knapsack problems.To overcome this limitation, we propose the multi-play combinatorial semi-bandit (MP-CSB), where a player can select a non-negative integer action and observe multiple feedbacks from a single arm in each round. We propose two algorithms for the MP-CSB. One is a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that is computationally feasible even when the action space is exponentially large with respect to the number of arms, and attains $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret in the stochastic regime, where $T$ is the time horizon. The other is a best-of-both-worlds algorithm, which achieves $O(\log T)$ variance-dependent regret in the stochastic regime and the worst-case $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ regret in the adversarial regime. Moreover, its regret in adversarial one is data-dependent, adapting to the cumulative loss of the optimal action, the total quadratic variation, and the path-length of the loss sequence. Finally, we numerically show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods in the CSB literature.</p></details> |  |

Generally, combinatorial problems are transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form, but this transformation often complicates the solution landscape, degrading performance, especially for multi-state problems. To address this challenge, we model spin interactions as generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce the exploration space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on graph coloring problem using probabilistic Ising solvers, achieving similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine learning algorithms. It also shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO-based Ising solvers, including probabilistic Ising and simulated bifurcation machines. We also design 1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator on FPGA with the proposed approach that shows ~10000x performance acceleration compared to GPU-based Tabucol heuristics and reducing physical neurons by 1.5-4x over baseline Ising frameworks.

| **[Tight Lieb-Robinson Bound for approximation ratio in Quantum Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12732v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) holds promise for optimization problems in quantum computing, especially for combinatorial optimization. This analog framework attracts attention for its potential to address complex problems. Its gate-based homologous, QAOA with proven performance, has brought lots of attention to the NISQ era. Several numerical benchmarks try to classify these two metaheuristics however, classical computational power highly limits the performance insights. In this work, we introduce a new parametrized version of QA enabling a precise 1-local analysis of the algorithm. We develop a tight Lieb-Robinson bound for regular graphs, achieving the best-known numerical value to analyze QA locally. Studying MaxCut over cubic graph as a benchmark optimization problem, we show that a linear-schedule QA with a 1-local analysis achieves an approximation ratio over 0.7020, outperforming any known 1-local algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Assisted Vehicle Routing: Realizing QAOA-based Approach on Gate-Based Quantum Computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01614v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge with broad applications in logistics and transportation. In this work, we present a quantum-assisted framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a link-based formulation of VRP. Our approach encodes flow conservation and subtour elimination directly into the cost Hamiltonian, preserving graph structure while avoiding ancillary qubits. We design and implement the full pipeline on a gate-based quantum computer, including problem encoding, circuit synthesis, and execution on IBM Quantum System One. Experimental results on small VRP instances highlight the effects of penalty scaling, coefficient normalization, and circuit depth on solution feasibility under hardware noise. While scalability remains constrained by circuit complexity and decoherence, the study demonstrates a practical pathway for implementing VRP on quantum hardware and identifies methodological directions for advancing near-term quantum optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Matroid Intersection is in Catalytic Logspace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06435v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear matroid intersection is an important problem in combinatorial optimization. Given two linear matroids over the same ground set, the linear matroid intersection problem asks you to find a common independent set of maximum size. The deep interest in linear matroid intersection is due to the fact that it generalises many classical problems in theoretical computer science, such as bipartite matching, edge disjoint spanning trees, rainbow spanning tree, and many more. We study this problem in the model of catalytic computation: space-bounded machines are granted access to \textit{catalytic space}, which is additional working memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the end of its computation. Although linear matroid intersection has had a polynomial time algorithm for over 50 years, it remains an important open problem to show that linear matroid intersection belongs to any well studied subclass of $\mathsf{P}$. We address this problem for the class catalytic logspace ($\mathsf{CL}$) with a polynomial time bound ($\mathsf{CLP}$). Recently, Agarwala and Mertz (2025) showed that bipartite maximum matching can be computed in the class $\mathsf{CLP}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$. This was the first subclass of $\mathsf{P}$ shown to contain bipartite matching, and additionally the first problem outside $\mathsf{TC}^1$ shown to be contained in $\mathsf{CL}$. We significantly improve the result of Agarwala and Mertz by showing that linear matroid intersection can be computed in $\mathsf{CLP}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via Dynamic Joint-State Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07234v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance, but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems: Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*): Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method (Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning, offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient deep reinforcement learning environment for flexible job-shop scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07019v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world. In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed. However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL and PDR scheduling methods.</p></details> |  |

While most existing approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine specific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of individual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the NP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the instance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM collaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally efficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate a tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the search space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including rigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted ablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across 1,050 generated instances of varying complexity. Results show that our top-performing hybrid, BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick, achieves statistically significant improvements over the baseline, particularly on the most complex instances. Our findings confirm that leveraging an LLM to produce an a priori, instance-driven heuristic bias is a valuable approach for enhancing metaheuristics in complex optimization domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a journal for review</p></details> |

We observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small, since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of $3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem (OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to showcase the practical relevance of our findings.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |

While they have been tackled mainly via handcrafted heuristics in the past, advances in neural networks have motivated the development of general methods to learn heuristics from data. Many approaches utilize a neural network to directly construct a solution, but are limited in further improving based on already constructed solutions at inference time. Our approach, Moco, defines a lightweight solution construction procedure, guided by a single continuous vector $\theta$ (called heatmap) and learns a neural network to update $\theta$ for a single instance of a COP at inference time. The update is based on various features of the current search state. The training procedure is budget aware, targeting the overall best solution found during the entire search. Moco is a fully learnable meta optimizer not utilizing problem specific heuristics or requiring optimal solutions for training. We test Moco on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and show that it significantly improves over other heatmap based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures.

In our setting, $N$ agents on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates, thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.</p></details> |  |

MOCO problems are known to contain supported and unsupported non-dominated points, with the latter typically outnumbering the former. Supported points are, in general, easier to determine, can serve as representations, and are used in two-phase methods to generate the entire non-dominated point set. Despite their importance, several different characterizations for supported efficient solutions (and supported non-dominated points) are used in the literature. While these definitions are equivalent for multi-objective linear problems, they can yield different sets of supported non-dominated points for MOCO problems. We show by an example that these definitions are not equivalent for MOCO or general multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, we analyze the structural and computational properties of the resulting sets of supported non-dominated points. These considerations motivate us to summarize equivalent definitions and characterizations for supported efficient solutions and to introduce a distinction between supported and weakly supported efficient solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.12867</p></details> |

Most existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 24 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

This work presents a novel methodology for training Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) by reformulating the parameter optimization task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, our approach directly leverages the Hamiltonian of the chosen VQA ansatz and employs an adaptive, metaheuristic optimization scheme. This optimization strategy provides a rich set of configurable parameters which enables the adaptation to specific problem characteristics and available computational resources. The proposed framework is generalizable to arbitrary Hamiltonians and integrates a recursive refinement strategy to progressively approximate high-quality solutions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to significantly reduce computational overhead compared to classical and evolutionary optimizers, while achieving comparable or superior solution quality. These findings suggest that quantum annealers can serve as a scalable alternative to classical optimizers for VQA training, particularly in scenarios affected by barren plateaus and noisy gradient estimates, and open new possibilities for hybrid quantum gate - quantum annealing - classical optimization models in near-term quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 4 appendix, 14 images</p></details> |

A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Distance-based (and path-based) covering problems for graphs of given cyclomatic number](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00383v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a large family of graph covering problems, whose definitions rely on distances, for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number (that is, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the graph to destroy all cycles). These problems include (but are not restricted to) three families of problems: (i) variants of metric dimension, where one wants to choose a small set $S$ of vertices of the graph such that every vertex is uniquely determined by its ordered vector of distances to the vertices of $S$; (ii) variants of geodetic sets, where one wants to select a small set $S$ of vertices such that any vertex lies on some shortest path between two vertices of $S$; (iii) variants of path covers, where one wants to select a small set of paths such that every vertex or edge belongs to one of the paths. We generalize and/or improve previous results in the area which show that the optimal values for these problems can be upper-bounded by a linear function of the cyclomatic number and the degree~1-vertices of the graph. To this end, we develop and enhance a technique recently introduced in [C. Lu, Q. Ye, C. Zhu. Algorithmic aspect on the minimum (weighted) doubly resolving set problem of graphs, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 44:2029--2039, 2022] and give near-optimal bounds in several cases. This solves (in some cases fully, in some cases partially) some conjectures and open questions from the literature. The method, based on breadth-first search, is of algorithmic nature and thus, all the constructions can be computed in linear time. Our results also imply an algorithmic consequence for the computation of the optimal solutions: for some of the problems, they can be computed in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version appeared in the proceedings of the conference FCT 2023</p></details> |

To address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO, that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing, addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem. This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Elicitation for Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization with Active Learning and Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11435v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life combinatorial optimization problems often involve several conflicting objectives, such as price, product quality and sustainability. A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Fitness Landscape of Large Language Model-Assisted Automated Algorithm Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19636v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in an evolutionary or other iterative search framework have demonstrated significant potential in automated algorithm design. However, the underlying fitness landscape, which is critical for understanding its search behavior, remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly-used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. Moreover, we adopt four different methods for algorithm similarity measurement and study their correlations to algorithm performance and operator behaviour. These insights not only deepen our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical insights for designing more effective LAS methods.</p></details> |  |

The input of PCOG consists of a set of agents and a combinatorial structure (typically a graph) with a fixed optimization goal on this structure (e.g., finding a minimum dominating set on a graph) such that the structure is divided among the agents. The value of each coalition of agents is derived from the optimal solution for the part of the structure possessed by the coalition. We study two fundamental questions related to the core: Core Stability Verification and Core Stability Existence. We analyze the algorithmic complexity of both questions for four classic graph optimization tasks: minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, minimum spanning tree, and maximum matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exact Optimization for Minimum Dominating Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18256v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem is a well-established combinatorial optimization problem with numerous real-world applications. Its NP-hard nature makes it increasingly difficult to obtain exact solutions as the graph size grows. This paper introduces ParDS, an exact algorithm developed to address the MDS problem within the branch-and-bound framework. ParDS features two key innovations: an advanced linear programming technique that yields tighter lower bounds and a set of novel reduction rules that dynamically simplify instances throughout the solving process. Compared to the leading exact algorithms presented at IJCAI 2023 and 2024, ParDS demonstrates theoretically superior lower-bound quality. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets highlight several significant advantages of ParDS: it achieves fastest solving times in 70% of graph categories, especially on large, sparse graphs, delivers a speed-up of up to 3,411 times on the fastest individual instance, and successfully solves 16 out of 43 instances that other algorithms were unable to resolve within the 5-hour time limit. These findings establish ParDS as a state-of-the-art solution for exactly solving the MDS problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10811v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions by combining prior knowledge with ongoing function evaluations. BO constructs a probabilistic surrogate model of the objective function given the covariates, which is in turn used to inform the selection of future evaluation points through an acquisition function. For smooth continuous search spaces, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as the surrogate model as they offer analytical access to posterior predictive distributions, thus facilitating the computation and optimization of acquisition functions. However, in complex scenarios involving optimization over categorical or mixed covariate spaces, GPs may not be ideal. This paper introduces Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization (SBBO) as a novel approach to optimizing acquisition functions that only requires sampling-based access to posterior predictive distributions. SBBO allows the use of surrogate probabilistic models tailored for combinatorial spaces with discrete variables. Any Bayesian model in which posterior inference is carried out through Markov chain Monte Carlo can be selected as the surrogate model in SBBO. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of SBBO using various choices of surrogate models in applications involving combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Statistics and Computing</p></details> |

This advancement has focused attention on formulating combinatorial optimization problems as quadratic polynomials. To improve the performance of solving large QUBO problems, it is essential to minimize the number of binary variables used in the objective function. In this paper, we propose a QUBO formulation that offers a bit capacity advantage over conventional quadratization techniques. As a key application, this formulation significantly reduces the number of binary variables required for score-based Bayesian network structure learning. Experimental results on $16$ instances, ranging from $37$ to $223$ variables, demonstrate that our approach requires notably fewer binary variables than quadratization. Moreover, an annealing machine that implement our formulation have outperformed existing algorithms in score maximization.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures, AAAI2025</p></details> |

E-graph extraction is a challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However, traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities, guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster. Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at https://github.com/Yu-Maryland/e-boost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD 2025</p></details> |

Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems -- a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agentic frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing the strengths and limitations of existing LLM agents and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[SPL-LNS: Sampling-Enhanced Large Neighborhood Search for Solving Integer Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16171v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast globally optimal Truncated Least Squares point cloud registration with fixed rotation axis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15613v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis of the relaxations of the stable set polytope leads to bounds on the clique and stability numbers of some regular graphs reminiscent of classical bounds by Delsarte and Hoffman, as well as the notion of deeply vertex-transitive graphs -- highly symmetric graphs that we show arise naturally from some association schemes. We also study relaxations of the hypergraph matching problem, and determine exactly or provide bounds on the lift-and-project ranks of these relaxations. Our proofs for these results also inspire the study of a homogeneous coherent configuration based on hypermatchings, which is an association scheme except it is generally non-commutative. We then illustrate the usefulness of obtaining commutative subschemes from non-commutative homogeneous coherent configurations via contraction in this context.</p></details> |  |

Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.</p></details> | preprint |

In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly. In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem. Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement, especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoCut: Strengthening Integer Programs via Evolution-Guided Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11850v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i) initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57% within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at https://github.com/milad1378yz/EvoCut.</p></details> |  |

Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available (Github public repository: github.com/RKO-solver), is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It represents an interpretable continuous-time version of the discrete-time `step and turn' models widely used in analysing wildlife telemetry. In this paper, I derive a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out exact Bayesian inference for velocity-jump models by reconstructing the trajectories between observations, and illustrate its use in analysing real and simulated telemetry data. The method uses a proposal distribution for updating velocities that is constructed by approximating the movement model with a multivariate normal distribution and then conditioning that distribution on the data. The velocity-jump models considered can incorporate measurement error and Markov dependence between successive velocities.</p></details> |  |

An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, the short version is to be submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |

We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects, sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of the range of EIS estimates in the literature.</p></details> | 45 pages |

Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Novel Integrated Architecture for Intent Based Approach and Zero Touch Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21026v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition to Sixth Generation (6G) networks presents challenges in managing quality of service (QoS) of diverse applications and achieving Service Level Agreements (SLAs) under varying network conditions. Hence, network management must be automated with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve real-time requirements. Zero touch network (ZTN) is one of the frameworks to automate network management with mechanisms such as closed loop control to ensure that the goals are met perpetually. Intent- Based Networking (IBN) specifies the user intents with diverse network requirements or goals which are then translated into specific network configurations and actions. This paper presents a novel architecture for integrating IBN and ZTN to serve the intent goals. Users provides the intent in the form of natural language, e.g., English, which is then translated using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG)) into Network Intent LanguagE (Nile). The Nile intent is then passed on to the BiLSTM and Q-learning based ZTN closed loop framework as a goal which maintains the intent under varying network conditions. Thus, the proposed architecture can work autonomously to ensure the network performance goal is met by just specifying the user intent in English. The integrated architecture is also implemented on a testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI). Additionally, to evaluate the architecture, an optimization problem is formulated which evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations.

| **[Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to MCMC acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589v5)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As concrete algorithmic applications in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we provide two illustrations based on lifted MCMC and swapping algorithm respectively to demonstrate projection samplers improve mixing over the original samplers. The projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step, and we prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm. Through simple numerical experiments on a bimodal target distribution, we show that the projection samplers mix effectively, in contrast to lifted MCMC and the swapping algorithm, which mix less well.</p></details> | 41 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Modi linear failure rate distribution with application to survival time data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20831v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new lifetime model, named the Modi linear failure rate distribution, is suggested. This flexible model is capable of accommodating a wide range of hazard rate shapes, including decreasing, increasing, bathtub, upside-down bathtub, and modified bathtub forms, making it particularly suitable for modeling diverse survival and reliability data. Our proposed model contains the Modi exponential distribution and the Modi Rayleigh distribution as sub-models. Numerous mathematical and reliability properties are derived, including the $r^{th}$ moment, moment generating function, $r^{th}$ conditional moment, quantile function, order statistics, mean deviations, R\'{e}nyi entropy, and reliability function. The method of maximum likelihood is employed to estimate the model parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to examine how these estimators perform. The superior fit of our newly introduced model is proved through two real-world survival data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in Categorical Cybernetics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02688v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ACT 2024, arXiv:2509.18357</p></details> |
| **[Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.</p></details> |  |

We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the behavior of MCTS agents is difficult for developers and users due to the frequently large and complex search trees that result from the simulation of many possible futures, their evaluations, and their relationships. This paper presents our ongoing investigation into potential explanations for the decision-making and behavior of MCTS. A weakness of MCTS is that it constructs a highly selective tree and, as a result, can miss crucial moves and fall into tactical traps. Full-width minimax search constitutes the solution. We integrate shallow minimax search into the rollout phase of multi-agent MCTS and use process mining technique to explain agents' strategies in 3v3 checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, AAAI 2025 PRL</p></details> |

The proposed approach augments control barrier functions with a novel $\psi$-weighted formulation that encodes directional control alignment between agents into the safety constraints. Deterministic admissibility is combined with empirical validation via Monte Carlo rollouts, and a PAC-style guarantee is derived based on margin-aware safety violations to provide a probabilistic safety certificate. The results from the experiments conducted under different bounded stochastic disturbances validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 16 figures, reviewed version.

| **[A Quad-Step Approach to Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10302v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is vital for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, yet challenges remain due to data scarcity and limited uncertainty awareness. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification with transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. We benchmark several pre-trained feature extractors -- including CLIP variants, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, and EfficientNet-V2-Large -- combined with traditional classifiers such as SVM, XGBoost, and logistic regression. Multiple principal component analysis (PCA) settings (64, 128, 256, 512) are explored, with LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/14 at PCA-256 achieving the strongest baseline results. In the UQ phase, Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) are applied and evaluated using uncertainty-aware metrics (UAcc, USen, USpe, UPre). Ensemble methods with PCA-256 provide the best balance between accuracy and reliability. Further improvements are obtained through feature fusion of top-performing extractors at PCA-256. Finally, we propose a feature-fusion based model trained with a predictive entropy (PE) loss function, which outperforms all prior configurations across both standard and uncertainty-aware evaluations, advancing trustworthy DL-based skin cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU-accelerated FREDopt package for simultaneous dose and LETd proton radiotherapy plan optimization via superiorization methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20012v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents FREDopt, a newly developed GPU-accelerated open-source optimization software for simultaneous proton dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) optimization in IMPT treatment planning. FREDopt was implemented entirely in Python, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration and incorporating fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the FRED code. The treatment plan optimization workflow includes pre-optimization and optimization, the latter equipped with a novel superiorization of feasibility-seeking algorithms. Feasibility-seeking requires finding a point that satisfies prescribed constraints. Superiorization interlaces computational perturbations into iterative feasibility-seeking steps to steer them toward a superior feasible point, replacing the need for costly full-fledged constrained optimization. The method was validated on two treatment plans of patients treated in a clinical proton therapy center, with dose and LETd distributions compared before and after reoptimization. Simultaneous dose and LETd optimization using FREDopt led to a substantial reduction of LETd and (dose)x(LETd) in organs at risk (OARs) while preserving target dose conformity. Computational performance evaluation showed execution times of 14-50 minutes, depending on the algorithm and target volume size-satisfactory for clinical and research applications while enabling further development of the well-tested, documented open-source software.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

| **[From Samples to Scenarios: A New Paradigm for Probabilistic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19975v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we build upon existing research [Goh, H. et al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2022] by proposing a novel loss function to train variational autoencoders for Bayesian inverse problems. When the forward map is affine, we provide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the latent states of variational autoencoders to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We validate this theoretical result through numerical tests and we compare the proposed variational autoencoder with the existing one in the literature both in terms of accuracy and generalization properties. Finally, we test the proposed variational autoencoder on a Laplace equation, with comparison to the original one and Markov Chains Monte Carlo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Operator-induced Symbolic Regression Trees for Structural Learning of Scientific Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19710v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Scientific Machine Learning has heralded a transformative era in scientific discovery, driving progress across diverse domains. Central to this progress is uncovering scientific laws from experimental data through symbolic regression. However, existing approaches are dominated by heuristic algorithms or data-hungry black-box methods, which often demand low-noise settings and lack principled uncertainty quantification. Motivated by interpretable Statistical Artificial Intelligence, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for symbolic regression that represents scientific laws as ensembles of tree-structured symbolic expressions endowed with a regularized tree prior. This coherent probabilistic formulation enables full posterior inference via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, yielding a balance between predictive accuracy and structural parsimony. To guide symbolic model selection, we develop a marginal posterior-based criterion adhering to the Occam's window principle and further quantify structural fidelity to ground truth through a tailored expression-distance metric. On the theoretical front, we establish near-minimax rate of Bayesian posterior concentration, providing the first rigorous guarantee in context of symbolic regression. Empirical evaluation demonstrates robust performance of our proposed methodology against state-of-the-art competing modules on a simulated example, a suite of canonical Feynman equations, and single-atom catalysis dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

| **[Sparse Max-Affine Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02225v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Sparse Gradient Descent as a solution for variable selection in convex piecewise linear regression, where the model is given as the maximum of $k$-affine functions $ x \mapsto \max_{j \in [k]} \langle a_j^\star, x \rangle + b_j^\star$ for $j = 1,\dots,k$. Here, $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ and $\{b_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ denote the ground-truth weight vectors and intercepts. A non-asymptotic local convergence analysis is provided for Sp-GD under sub-Gaussian noise when the covariate distribution satisfies the sub-Gaussianity and anti-concentration properties. When the model order and parameters are fixed, Sp-GD provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\max(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_z^2,1)s\log(d/s))$ observations where $\sigma_z^2$ denotes the noise variance. This also implies the exact parameter recovery by Sp-GD from $\mathcal{O}(s\log(d/s))$ noise-free observations. The proposed initialization scheme uses sparse principal component analysis to estimate the subspace spanned by $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$, then applies an $r$-covering search to estimate the model parameters. A non-asymptotic analysis is presented for this initialization scheme when the covariates and noise samples follow Gaussian distributions. When the model order and parameters are fixed, this initialization scheme provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\max(\sigma_z^4,\sigma_z^2,1)s^2\log^4(d))$ observations. A new transformation named Real Maslov Dequantization (RMD) is proposed to transform sparse generalized polynomials into sparse max-affine models. The error decay rate of RMD is shown to be exponentially small in its temperature parameter. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees for Sp-GD are extended to the bounded noise model induced by RMD. Numerical Monte Carlo results corroborate theoretical findings for Sp-GD and the initialization scheme.</p></details> |  |

Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.</p></details> |  |

Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus, $\mu_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M_B(z)$, and their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe~Ia) and DES 5YR (435 SNe~Ia), we find that SNe~Ia are consistent with being standard candles within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z \sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$--$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical. Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN~Ia populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 04 Figures, Under review</p></details> |

We subsequently combine such inference by stacking these models across the range of values of the hyper-parameters.

We propose two novel methods: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT) and the conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learner, that generate full predictive distributions of both potential outcomes and ITEs. Our approaches combine weighted conformal predictive systems with either analytic convolution of potential outcome distributions or Monte Carlo sampling, addressing covariate shift through propensity score weighting. In contrast to other approaches that allow the generation of potential outcome predictive distributions, our approaches are model agnostic, universal, and come with finite-sample guarantees of probabilistic calibration under knowledge of the propensity score. Regarding estimating the ITE distribution, we formally characterize how assumptions about potential outcomes' noise dependency impact distribution validity and establish universal consistency under independence noise assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions while maintaining narrow prediction intervals and having performant continuous ranked probability scores. Besides probabilistic forecasting performance, we observe significant efficiency gains for the CCT- and CMC meta-learners compared to other conformal approaches that produce prediction intervals for ITE with coverage guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major update (rescope to distributional regression in counterfactual inference)</p></details> |

However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.</p></details> |  |

This computational cost comes from the need to resolve individual collision events in high-collisional regimes. However, in such regimes, one can approximate the high-collisional kinetic dynamics with computationally cheaper diffusion. Asymptotic-preserving schemes make use of this limit to perform simulations in these regimes, without a blow-up in computational cost as incurred by standard kinetic approaches. One such scheme is Kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo. In this paper, we present a first extension of this scheme to the two-dimensional setting and its implementation in the Eiron particle code. We then demonstrate that this implementation produces a significant speedup over kinetic simulations in high-collisional cases.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> |  |

While automated machine and deep learning-based methods provide more consistent and precise measurements compared to subjective BI-RADS assessments, they often fail to account for the longitudinal evolution of density. Many of these methods assess mammographic density in a cross-sectional manner, overlooking correlations in repeated measures, irregular visit intervals, missing data, and informative dropouts. Joint models, however, are well-suited for capturing the longitudinal relationship between biomarkers and survival outcomes. We present the DeepJoint algorithm, an open-source solution that integrates deep learning for quantitative mammographic density estimation with joint modeling to assess the longitudinal relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer risk. Our method efficiently analyzes processed mammograms from various manufacturers, estimating both dense area and percent density--established risk factors for breast cancer. We utilize a joint model to explore their association with breast cancer risk and provide individualized risk predictions. Bayesian inference and the Monte Carlo consensus algorithm make the approach reliable for large screening datasets. Our method allows for accurate analysis of processed mammograms from multiple manufacturers, offering a comprehensive view of breast cancer risk based on individual longitudinal density profiles. The complete pipeline is publicly available, promoting broader application and comparison with other methods.</p></details> |  |

First, the Glass-Box Transparency Index (GTI) quantifies the fraction of performance variance explainable by internal features and comes equipped with bounds, invariances, cross-validated estimation, and bootstrap confidence intervals. Second, Explainable Throughput Decomposition (ETD) uses Shapley values to provide an efficiency-preserving attribution of throughput, together with non-asymptotic Monte Carlo error guarantees and convexity (Jensen) gap bounds. Third, we develop an exact Markov analytic framework for branch predictors, including a closed-form misprediction rate for a two-bit saturating counter under a two-state Markov branch process and its i.i.d. corollary. Additionally, we establish an identifiability theorem for recovering event rates from aggregated hardware counters and provide stability bounds under noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, 1 pseudocode</p></details> |

The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report, marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive ASR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Least squares variational inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18475v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational inference consists in finding the best approximation of a target distribution within a certain family, where `best' means (typically) smallest Kullback-Leiber divergence. We show that, when the approximation family is exponential, the best approximation is the solution of a fixed-point equation. We introduce LSVI (Least-Squares Variational Inference), a Monte Carlo variant of the corresponding fixed-point recursion, where each iteration boils down to ordinary least squares regression and does not require computing gradients. We show that LSVI is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent; we use this insight to derive convergence guarantees. We introduce various ideas to improve LSVI further when the approximation family is Gaussian, leading to a $O(d^3)$ complexity in the dimension $d$ of the target in the full-covariance case, and a $O(d)$ complexity in the mean-field case. We show that LSVI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a range of examples, while remaining gradient-free, that is, it does not require computing gradients.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 41 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[On the Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18822v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.</p></details> |  |

For sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite quadrature, lower and upper bounds are established, with rates coinciding up to a logarithmic factor. The dominant rate is found to be only $N^{-\alpha/2}$ with $N$ function evaluations, although the optimal rate is known to be $N^{-\alpha}(\ln N)^{(d-1)/2}$. The lower bound is obtained by exploiting the structure of the Gauss--Hermite nodes and is independent of the quadrature weights; consequently, no modification of the weights can improve the rate $N^{-\alpha/2}$. In contrast, several quasi-Monte Carlo methods with a change of variables are shown to achieve the optimal rate, some up to, and one including, the logarithmic factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Sliced Wasserstein Distance Computation via Adaptive Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17405v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) reduces optimal transport on $\mathbb{R}^d$ to a sum of one-dimensional projections, and thanks to this efficiency, it is widely used in geometry, generative modeling, and registration tasks. Recent work shows that quasi-Monte Carlo constructions for computing SW (QSW) yield direction sets with excellent approximation error. This paper presents an alternate, novel approach: learning directions with Bayesian optimization (BO), particularly in settings where SW appears inside an optimization loop (e.g., gradient flows). We introduce a family of drop-in selectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit sphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds from competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and ARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during optimization. Our BO approaches can be composed with QSW and its variants (demonstrated by ABOSW/ARBOSW) and require no changes to downstream losses or gradients. We provide numerical experiments where our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, and on the experimental suite of the original QSW paper, we find that ABOSW and ARBOSW can achieve convergence comparable to the best QSW variants with modest runtime overhead.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Athena: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Data-efficient Process Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09532v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adaptive Bayesian Joint Latent Space Modeling via Cumulative Shrinkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18580v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network models are increasingly vital in psychometrics for analyzing relational data, which are often accompanied by high-dimensional node attributes. Joint latent space models (JLSM) provide an elegant framework for integrating these data sources by assuming a shared underlying latent representation; however, a persistent methodological challenge is determining the dimension of the latent space, as existing methods typically require pre-specification or rely on computationally intensive post-hoc procedures. We develop a novel Bayesian joint latent space model that incorporates a cumulative ordered spike-and-slab (COSS) prior. This approach enables the latent dimension to be inferred automatically and simultaneously with all model parameters. We develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for posterior computation. Theoretically, we establish that the posterior distribution concentrates on the true latent dimension and that parameter estimates achieve Hellinger consistency at a near-optimal rate that adapts to the unknown dimensionality. Through extensive simulations and two real-data applications, we demonstrate the method's superior performance in both dimension recovery and parameter estimation. Our work offers a principled, computationally efficient, and theoretically grounded solution for adaptive dimension selection in psychometric network models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Losing is for Cherishing: Data Valuation Based on Machine Unlearning and Shapley Value](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16147v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are theoretical mistakes in Section 3.2, where the definition of utility should be fixed.

MoCrop uses motion vectors that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6 to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment in the compressed domain.

| **[A Counterfactual Reasoning Framework for Fault Diagnosis in Robot Perception Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18460v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception systems provide a rich understanding of the environment for autonomous systems, shaping decisions in all downstream modules. Hence, accurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important. Faults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied to the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage pipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a counterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection and isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical redundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical redundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability tests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios. Counterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized faults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and active FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates, the active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find control inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as Effective Information (EI). The mentioned metric quantifies the informativeness of control inputs for FDI. We demonstrate the approach in a robot exploration scenario, where a space robot performing vision-based navigation actively adjusts its attitude to increase EI and correctly isolate faults caused by sensor damage, dynamic scenes, and perceptual degradation.</p></details> |  |

Yet convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations, but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices; manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods, yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 algorithm, 1 table of experiment cases</p></details> |
| **[Bayes Error Rate Estimation in Difficult Situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03159v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Network-Driven Direct CBCT-Based Dose Calculation for Head-and-Neck Proton Treatment Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18378v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate dose calculation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is essential for modern proton treatment planning workflows, particularly when accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes in adaptive treatment scenarios. Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality limitations, requiring complex correction workflows. This study develops and validates a deep learning approach for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT images using extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) neural networks. A retrospective dataset of 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning CT and treatment CBCT images was used to train an xLSTM-based neural network (CBCT-NN). The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and beam's-eye-view sequence modelling to capture spatial dependencies in proton dose deposition patterns. Training utilized 82,500 paired beam configurations with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses. Validation was performed on 5 independent patients using gamma analysis, mean percentage dose error assessment, and dose-volume histogram comparison. The CBCT-NN achieved gamma pass rates of 95.1 $\pm$ 2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria. Mean percentage dose errors were 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4% in high-dose regions ($>$90% of max dose) and 5.9 $\pm$ 1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent preservation of target coverage metrics (Clinical Target Volume V95% difference: -0.6 $\pm$ 1.1%) and organ-at-risk constraints (parotid mean dose difference: -0.5 $\pm$ 1.5%). Computation time is under 3 minutes without sacrificing Monte Carlo-level accuracy. This study demonstrates the proof-of-principle of direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM neural networks. The approach eliminates traditional correction workflows while achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for adaptive protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of structure-aware sample quality assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural SDE Training using Wiener-Space Cubature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12395v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and diffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for neural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network) parameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on infinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods to efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with respect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the gradient expectation. In this work we introduce a novel training technique which bypasses and improves upon this Monte-Carlo simulation; we extend results in the theory of Wiener space cubature to approximate the expected objective functional value by a weighted sum of functional evaluations of deterministic ODE solutions. Our main mathematical contribution enabling this approximation is an extension of cubature bounds to the setting of Lipschitz-nonlinear functionals acting on path-space. Our resulting constructive algorithm allows for more computationally efficient training along several lines. First, it circumvents Brownian motion simulation and enables the use of efficient parallel ODE solvers, thus decreasing the complexity of path-functional evaluation. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that the number of paths required to achieve a given (expected loss functional oracle value) approximation can be reduced in this deterministic cubature regime. Specifically, we show that under reasonable regularity assumptions we can observe a O(1/n) convergence rate, where n is the number of path evaluations; in contrast with the standard O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of naive Monte-Carlo or the O(log(n)^d /n) rate of quasi-Monte-Carlo.</p></details> |  |

The CC-WAIC accounts for temporal or structural dependence by incorporating the full posterior covariance structure of the log-likelihood contributions, in contrast to the classical WAIC that assumes conditional independence among data. We exploit the limitations of classical WAIC in the sequential data contexts and derive the CC-WAIC criterion under a theoretical framework. In addition, we propose a bias correction based on effective sample size to improve estimation from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of CC-WAIC in terms of stability and appropriateness for dependent data. This new criterion is supported by formal mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and discussion of implications for model selection in both classical and modern Bayesian applications. To evaluate the reliability of CC-WAIC under varying data regimes, we conduct simulation experiments across multiple time series lengths (small, medium, and large) and different levels of temporal dependence, enabling a comprehensive performance assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure, Preprint</p></details> |

This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills, individually or jointly deployed in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty, while automation may struggle to match the economic utility of human skills in more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that, when high level of generalization is required and the cost of errors is high, combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: in complex and critical contexts, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task may be insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resul...</summary><p>Results enriched by experiment focusing on machine skill achieving high performance across all task difficulties; results of the primary experiment unchanged; data analysis section expanded; conclusions enriched and re-organized; abstract perfected; example in section A.4.1 enhanced; corrections to Table 17 (now Table 21); minor typos corrected</p></details> |

However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |

This class of PDMPs adapts the concept of a mirror map from convex optimisation to address sampling problems. Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Clustering methods for Categorical Time Series and Sequences : A scoping review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07885v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To provide an overview of clustering methods for categorical time series (CTS), a data structure commonly found in epidemiology, sociology, biology, and marketing, and to support method selection in regards to data characteristics. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception up to November 2024 to identify articles that propose and evaluate clustering techniques for CTS. Methods were classified according to three major families -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on their ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length, multivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates, and large data volumes. Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129 methods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and epidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal Matching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based methods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data structures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant covariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average more scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to facilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics ( https://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ ) Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches offer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable. Feature-based methods favor performance over flexibility, with limited support for complex data structures. Conclusion: This review highlights methodological diversity and gaps in CTS clustering. The proposed typology aims to guide researchers in selecting methods for their specific use cases.</p></details> |  |

The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

While various machine learning algorithms have been developed to enhance performance on data-scarce tasks, their evaluation often lacks real-world scenarios. Consequently, their efficacy in challenging practical applications has not yet been profoundly assessed. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating supervised and SSL methods for crop-type classification under real-world conditions. This benchmark study relies on the EuroCropsML time-series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to supervised transfer learning and SSL methods. However, compared to simpler transfer learning, the improvement of meta-learning comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, supervised methods benefit most when pre-trained and fine-tuned on geographically close regions. In addition, while SSL generally lags behind meta-learning, it demonstrates advantages over training from scratch, particularly in capturing fine-grained features essential for real-world crop-type classification, and also surpasses standard transfer learning. This highlights its practical value when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce. Our insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational demand in selecting supervised machine learning methods for real-world crop-type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of knowledge transfer across diverse geographic regions. Furthermore, they demonstrate the practical value of SSL approaches when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |
| **[One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04208v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21002v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness.

However, most of these studies have not thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments, progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon, demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper underlying causes of the failure of embedding.</p></details> |  |

For multivariate time series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid, implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[A Deep Learning Framework for Evaluating Dynamic Network Generative Models and Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11901v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding dynamic systems like disease outbreaks, social influence, and information diffusion requires effective modeling of complex networks. Traditional evaluation methods for static networks often fall short when applied to temporal networks. This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507). These findings highlight DGSP-GCN's effectiveness in evaluating and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks, offering valuable insights for network evolution and anomaly detection research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditionally Whitened Generative Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20928v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[OLMA: One Loss for More Accurate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11567v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting faces two important but often overlooked challenges. Firstly, the inherent random noise in the time series labels sets a theoretical lower bound for the forecasting error, which is positively correlated with the entropy of the labels. Secondly, neural networks exhibit a frequency bias when modeling the state-space of time series, that is, the model performs well in learning certain frequency bands but poorly in others, thus restricting the overall forecasting performance. To address the first challenge, we prove a theorem that there exists a unitary transformation that can reduce the marginal entropy of multiple correlated Gaussian processes, thereby providing guidance for reducing the lower bound of forecasting error. Furthermore, experiments confirm that Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can reduce the entropy in the majority of scenarios. Correspondingly, to alleviate the frequency bias, we jointly introduce supervision in the frequency domain along the temporal dimension through DFT and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). This supervision-side strategy is highly general and can be seamlessly integrated into any supervised learning method. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function named OLMA, which utilizes the frequency domain transformation across both channel and temporal dimensions to enhance forecasting. Finally, the experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OLMA in addressing the above two challenges and the resulting improvement in forecasting accuracy. The results also indicate that the perspectives of entropy and frequency bias provide a new and feasible research direction for time series forecasting. The code is available at: https://github.com/Yuyun1011/OLMA-One-Loss-for-More-Accurate-Time-Series-Forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain, enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction, electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with traditional time-domain saliency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines, especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International ECML-PKDD Workshop-Tutorial on Learning on Real and Synthetic Medical Time Series Data (MED-TIME)</p></details> |
| **[Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Numeric Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20823v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 images, 4 tables in the main paper.

| **[ParallelTime: Dynamically Weighting the Balance of Short- and Long-Term Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13998v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The implementation is readily available at: \href{https://github.com/itay1551/ParallelTime}{GitHub}.</p></details> |  |
| **[IConv: Focusing on Local Variation with Channel Independent Convolution for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20783v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions, resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.</p></details> | Submitted to AAAI |

Inferring the underlying network structure from such partial observations remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under nonlinear dynamics. We uncover a robust linear relationship between the spectral strength of a node's behavioral time series under evolutionary game dynamics and its structural degree, $S \propto k$, a structural-behavioral scaling that holds across network types and scales, revealing a universal correspondence between local connectivity and dynamic energy. Leveraging this insight, we develop a deterministic, frequency-domain inference framework based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) that reconstructs network topology directly from payoff sequences-without prior knowledge of the network or internal node strategies-by selectively perturbing node dynamics. The framework simultaneously localizes individual hidden nodes or identifies all edges connected to multiple hidden nodes, and estimates tight bounds on the number of hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both topology reconstruction and hidden component detection. Moreover, it scales efficiently to large networks, offering robustness to stochastic fluctuations and overcoming the size limitations of existing techniques. Our work establishes a principled connection between local dynamic observables and global structural inference, enabling accurate topology recovery in complex systems with hidden elements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Communications Physics for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model S$^2$Transformer by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2509.18115</p></details> |

The explosion of temporally correlated streaming data from advanced seismic sensors poses analytical challenges due to its sheer volume and real-time nature. Sampling, or data reduction, is a natural yet powerful tool for handling large streaming data while balancing estimation accuracy and computational cost. Currently, data reduction methods and their statistical properties for streaming data, especially streaming autoregressive time series, are not well-studied in the literature. In this article, we propose an online leverage-based sequential data reduction algorithm for streaming autoregressive time series with application to seismic data. The proposed Sequential Leveraging Sampling (SLS) method selects only one consecutively recorded block from the data stream for inference. While the starting point of the SLS block is chosen using a random mechanism based on streaming leverage scores of data, the block size is determined by a sequential stopping rule. The SLS block offers efficient sample usage, as evidenced by our results confirming asymptotic normality for the normalized least squares estimator in both linear and nonlinear autoregressive settings. The SLS method is applied to two seismic datasets: the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake doublet data on the macroseismic scale and the Oklahoma seismic data on the microseismic scale. We demonstrate the ability of the SLS method to efficiently identify seismic events and elucidate their intricate temporal dependence structure. Simulation studies are presented to evaluate the empirical performance of the SLS method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Annals of Applied Statistics</p></details> |

A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML) techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches, our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20460v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-Informed Forecasting of Complex Thermal Dynamics in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20349v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise. Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Lagging for Time-Series Forecasting in E-Commerce Finance: Mitigating Information Loss with A Hybrid ML Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20244v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5% reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20184v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  |

We propose DiffNator, a framework for structured explanations of differences between two time series. We first design a JSON schema that captures the essential properties of such differences. Using the Time-series Observations of Real-world IoT (TORI) dataset, we generate paired sequences and train a model that combine a time-series encoder with a frozen LLM to output JSON-formatted explanations. Experimental results show that DiffNator generates accurate difference explanations and substantially outperforms both a visual question answering (VQA) baseline and a retrieval method using a pre-trained time-series encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pi-Transformer: A Physics-informed Attention Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19985v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Samples to Scenarios: A New Paradigm for Probabilistic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19975v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matrix Autoregressive Model with Vector Time Series Covariates for Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15671v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a new methodology for forecasting matrix-valued time series with historical matrix data and auxiliary vector time series data. We focus on a time series of matrices defined on a static 2-D spatial grid and an auxiliary time series of non-spatial vectors. The proposed model, Matrix AutoRegression with Auxiliary Covariates (MARAC), contains an autoregressive component for the historical matrix predictors and an additive component that maps the auxiliary vector predictors to a matrix response via tensor-vector product. The autoregressive component adopts a bi-linear transformation framework following Chen et al. (2021), significantly reducing the number of parameters. The auxiliary component posits that the tensor coefficient, which maps non-spatial predictors to a spatial response, contains slices of spatially smooth matrix coefficients that are discrete evaluations of smooth functions on a spatial grid from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose to estimate the model parameters under a penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework coupled with an alternating minimization algorithm. We establish the joint asymptotics of the autoregressive and tensor parameters under fixed and high-dimensional regimes. Extensive simulations and a geophysical application for forecasting the global Total Electron Content (TEC) are conducted to validate the performance of MARAC.</p></details> |  |

By assuming a constant transition probability matrix and allowing emission distributions to vary according to hidden states, the proposed model effectively captures dynamic dependencies between variables. Through the estimation of state-specific parameters, including location, scale, and skewness, the proposed model enables the detection of structural changes, such as shifts in the observed data distribution, while addressing challenges such as overfitting and computational inefficiencies inherent in Gaussian mixtures. Both simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the approach, highlighting its ability to accurately model asymmetric data and detect regime transitions. This methodological advancement broadens the applicability of a finite mixture of hidden Markov models across various fields, including demography, economics, finance, and environmental studies, offering a powerful tool for understanding complex temporal dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18584v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines, particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 workshop Learning from Time Series for Health (TS4H)</p></details> |

The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Integration of Spatial-Temporal Knowledge: A Lightweight Approach to Atmospheric Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09695v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF. The code is available at https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/STELLA.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of spectral methods from classical Fourier analysis to modern neural operators, systematically summarizing three open challenges in current research: (1) causal structure preservation during spectral transformations, (2) uncertainty quantification in learned frequency representations, and (3) topology-aware analysis for non-Euclidean data structures. Through rigorous reviewing of over 100 studies, we develop a unified taxonomy that bridges conventional spectral techniques with cutting-edge machine learning approaches, while establishing standardized benchmarks for performance evaluation. Our work identifies key knowledge gaps in the field, particularly in geometric deep learning and quantum-enhanced spectral analysis. The survey offers practitioners a systematic framework for method selection and implementation, while charting promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This method applies bandpass filters to extract specific PC components from datasets, effectively eliminating unwanted interference such as noise. It then bootstraps the PC components, maintaining their correlation structure while resampling and enabling a clearer analysis of the estimation of the statistical properties of periodic patterns in time series data. While its efficiency has been demonstrated in environmental and epidemiological research, the theoretical properties of VBPBB, particularly regarding its bias of the estimated sampling distributions, remain unexamined. This study investigates issues regarding biases in VBPBB, including overall mean bias and pointwise mean bias, across a range of time series models of varying complexity, all of which exhibit periodic components. Using the R programming language, we simulate various PC time series and apply VBPBB to assess its bias under different conditions. Our findings provide key insights into the validity of VBPBB for periodic time series analysis and offer practical recommendations for its implementation, as well as directions for future theoretical advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance where significant data shifting exists.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, IEEE-EMBS BSN 2025</p></details> |

Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</p></details> |

However, despite their complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines.

However, these applications commonly face two critical challenges: time misalignment and data sparsity. Traditional approaches address these issues through a two-step process of imputation followed by prediction. We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components, MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.</p></details> | 36 pages, 4 figures |

Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL, the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 long paper</p></details> |
| **[Transformer Modeling for Both Scalability and Performance in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19471v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention (DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.</p></details> |  |

Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Thirt...</summary><p>Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems {NeurIPS 2025}.

However, these methods often fail to account for the dynamic dependencies both within and across series. In this work, we propose a general framework for forecasting high-dimensional time series that integrates dynamic dimension reduction with regularization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a simulated example and a forecasting application using an economic dataset. We show that several specific methods are encompassed within this framework, including Dynamic Principal Components and Reduced Rank Autoregressive Models. Furthermore, time-domain formulations of Dynamic Canonical Correlation and Dynamic Redundancy Analysis are introduced here for the first time as particular instances of the proposed methodology. All of these techniques are analyzed as special cases of a unified procedure, enabling a coherent derivation and interpretation across methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal tail coefficient for compound extremes in multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19007v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme events are often multivariate in nature. A compound extreme occurs when a combination of variables jointly produces a significant impact, even if individual components are not necessarily marginally extreme. Compound extremes have been observed across a wide range of domains, including space weather, climate, and environmental science. For example, heavy rainfall sustained over consecutive days can impose cumulative stress on urban drainage systems, potentially resulting in flooding. However, most existing methods for detecting extremal causality focus primarily on individual extreme values and lack the flexibility to capture causal relationships between compound extremes. This work introduces a novel framework for detecting causal dependencies between extreme events, including compound extremes. We introduce the compound causal tail coefficient that captures the extremal dependance of compound events between pairs of stationary time series. Based on a consistent estimator of this coefficient, we develop a bootstrap hypothesis test to evaluate the presence and direction of causal relationships. Our method can accommodate nonlinearity and latent confounding variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by establishing theoretic properties and through simulation studies and an application to space-weather data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05036v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04488v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed time series analysis with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks under Ehrenfest constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18483v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive. While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge: forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs, a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.</p></details> |  |

The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

| **["What is Different Between These Datasets?" A Framework for Explaining Data Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05652v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the quality of input data, yet real-world applications often face significant data-related challenges. A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile framework of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities-including tabular data, text data, images, time-series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cointegration with Occasionally Binding Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09604v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the literature on nonlinear cointegration, a long-standing open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression, which provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a vector of time series, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the profound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR), which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem to a nonlinearly cointegrated setting, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated, censored and kinked Brownian motions, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ii + ...</summary><p>ii + 58 pp., 4 figures; author accepted manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP combines a quantile forecaster with split-conformal calibration on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the conformal threshold with a Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across equities (S&P500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three consistent findings emerge. First, rolling QR produces the sharpest intervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&P500: 86.3% vs. 95% target). Second, TCP and TCP-RM achieve near-nominal coverage while delivering substantially narrower intervals than Historical Simulation (e.g., S&P500: 29% reduction in width). Third, the RM update improves calibration with negligible width cost. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and contracting intervals promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with red dots marking days of miscoverage. A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution for calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budgeted Adversarial Attack against Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17987v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The CC-WAIC accounts for temporal or structural dependence by incorporating the full posterior covariance structure of the log-likelihood contributions, in contrast to the classical WAIC that assumes conditional independence among data. We exploit the limitations of classical WAIC in the sequential data contexts and derive the CC-WAIC criterion under a theoretical framework. In addition, we propose a bias correction based on effective sample size to improve estimation from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of CC-WAIC in terms of stability and appropriateness for dependent data. This new criterion is supported by formal mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and discussion of implications for model selection in both classical and modern Bayesian applications. To evaluate the reliability of CC-WAIC under varying data regimes, we conduct simulation experiments across multiple time series lengths (small, medium, and large) and different levels of temporal dependence, enabling a comprehensive performance assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure, Preprint</p></details> |

Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on three tasks and four datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based models have advanced time series tasks, they often struggle with feature redundancy and limited generalization capabilities. Drawing inspiration from classical CNN architectures' pyramidal structure, we propose a Multi-Scale Representation Learning Framework based on a Conv-like ScaleFusion Transformer. Our approach introduces a temporal convolution-like structure that combines patching operations with multi-head attention, enabling progressive temporal dimension compression and feature channel expansion. We further develop a novel cross-scale attention mechanism for effective feature fusion across different temporal scales, along with a log-space normalization method for variable-length sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior feature independence, reduced redundancy, and better performance in forecasting and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we point out that this channel-wise asynchrony can lead to poor channel-wise modeling of existing deep learning methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose MTM, a multi-scale token mixing transformer for the classification of IMTS. We find that the channel-wise asynchrony can be alleviated by down-sampling the time series to coarser timescales, and propose to incorporate a masked concat pooling in MTM that gradually down-samples IMTS to enhance the channel-wise attention modules. Meanwhile, we propose a novel channel-wise token mixing mechanism which proactively chooses important tokens from one channel and mixes them with other channels, to further boost the channel-wise learning of our model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that MTM consistently achieves the best performance on all the benchmarks, with improvements of up to 3.8% in AUPRC for classification.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Despite advances in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics, thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust, domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference of Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways.</p></details> |  |

These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted, model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17472v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures (1 figure updated), 4 tables</p></details> |

While often viewed as impairments to reliable data transmission, this work introduces a paradigm shift by reconceptualizing these intrinsic physical properties as computational resources. We frame a canonical point-to-point MC channel, comprising ligand diffusion and reversible ligand-receptor binding at a spherical receiver, as a Physical Reservoir Computer (PRC). Utilizing deterministic mean-field modeling and particle-based spatial stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the MC system's inherent capability for complex temporal information processing on standard chaotic time-series benchmarks. We comprehensively evaluate performance using both task-specific Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and the task-independent Information Processing Capacity (IPC). Our results reveal a non-monotonic dependence of computational power on key biophysical parameters (receptor kinetic rates, diffusion coefficient, and transmitter-receiver distance), identifying optimal operational regimes where memory and nonlinearity are balanced. These findings establish the MC channel as a viable computational substrate, paving the way for novel architectures in \emph{wetware} artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17235v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> |

We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets.

| **[Time Series Forecasting Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Method: A Bi-LSTM Embedding Denoising Auto Encoder Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17165v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is a prevalent form of data found in various fields. It consists of a series of measurements taken over time. Forecasting is a crucial application of time series models, where future values are predicted based on historical data. Accurate forecasting is essential for making well-informed decisions across industries. When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), precise predictions play a key role in planning infrastructure development, load balancing, and energy management. This study introduces a BI-LSTM embedding denoising autoencoder model (BDM) designed to address time series problems, focusing on short-term EV charging load prediction. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark models like Transformer, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Based on the results of the study, the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in four of the five-time steps, demonstrating its effectiveness for time series forecasting. This research makes a significant contribution to enhancing time series forecasting, thereby improving decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale clustering and source separation of InSight mission seismic data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16189v5)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</p></details> |  |

Based on a long time-series perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information, forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities. Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a machine learning-based load shedding framework for the University of Lagos, designed to optimize distribution and reduce waste. The methodology followed three main stages. First, a dataset of 3,648 hourly records from 55 buildings was compiled to develop building-level consumption models. Second, Principal Component Analysis was applied for dimensionality reduction, and clustering validation techniques were used to determine the optimal number of demand groups. Mini-Batch K-Means was then employed to classify buildings into high-, medium-, and low-demand clusters. Finally, short-term load forecasting was performed at the cluster level using multiple statistical and deep learning models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and GRU. Results showed Prophet offered the most reliable forecasts, while Mini-Batch K-Means achieved stable clustering performance. By integrating clustering with forecasting, the framework enabled a fairer, data-driven load shedding strategy that reduces inefficiencies and supports climate change mitigation through sustainable energy management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for the NeurIPS 2025 Climata Change AI Workshop in San Diego, USA</p></details> |

However, much of the current research in MTSF tends to evaluate models from a holistic perspective, which obscures the individual contributions and leaves critical issues unaddressed. Adhering to the current modeling paradigms, this work bridges these gaps by systematically decomposing deep MTSF methods into their core, fine-grained components like series-patching tokenization, channel-independent strategy, attention modules, or even Large Language Models and Time-series Foundation Models. Through extensive experiments and component-level analysis, our work offers more profound insights than previous benchmarks that typically discuss models as a whole. Furthermore, we propose a novel automated solution called TSGym for MTSF tasks. Unlike traditional hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture searching or fixed model selection, TSGym performs fine-grained component selection and automated model construction, which enables the creation of more effective solutions tailored to diverse time series data, therefore enhancing model transferability across different data sources and robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments indicate that TSGym significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art MTSF and AutoML methods.

Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios.

Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images, landscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series, graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Inductive Biases for fMRI Time Series Classification during Resting-state and Movie-watching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16973v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced fMRI analysis, yet it remains unclear which architectural inductive biases are most effective at capturing functional patterns in human brain activity. This issue is particularly important in small-sample settings, as most datasets fall into this category. We compare models with three major inductive biases in deep learning including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers for the task of biological sex classification. These models are evaluated within a unified pipeline using parcellated multivariate fMRI time series from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7-Tesla cohort, which includes four resting-state runs and four movie-watching task runs. We assess performance on Whole-brain, subcortex, and 12 functional networks. CNNs consistently achieved the highest discrimination for sex classification in both resting-state and movie-watching, while LSTM and Transformer models underperformed. Network-resolved analyses indicated that the Whole-brain, Default Mode, Cingulo-Opercular, Dorsal Attention, and Frontoparietal networks were the most discriminative. These results were largely similar between resting-state and movie-watching. Our findings indicate that, at this dataset size, discriminative information is carried by local spatial patterns and inter-regional dependencies, favoring convolutional inductive bias. Our study provides insights for selecting deep learning architectures for fMRI time series classification.</p></details> |  |

QASA constructs quantum queries/keys/values via variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and applies standard softmax attention over Pauli-$Z$ expectation vectors, yielding a drop-in attention module for financial time-series decision making. Using daily data for \textbf{BTCUSDC} over \textbf{Jan-2024--Jan-2025} with a 70/15/15 time-series split, we compare QASA against classical ensembles, a transformer, and pure quantum baselines under Return, Sharpe, and Max Drawdown. The \textbf{QASA-Sequence} variant attains the \emph{best single-model risk-adjusted performance} (\textbf{13.99\%} return; \textbf{Sharpe 1.76}), while hybrid models average \textbf{11.2\%} return (vs.\ 9.8\% classical; 4.4\% pure quantum), indicating a favorable performance--stability--cost trade-off.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to some technical issues</p></details> |

Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |

These factors introduce substantial variability and noise into outage data, making reliable prediction challenging. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly effective for modeling nonlinear and dynamic time-series data, with proven applications in stock price forecasting [2], energy demand prediction, demand response [3], and traffic flow management [4]. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning framework, termed PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM component enhances temporal feature learning through efficient gradient optimization and long-term dependency capture. The framework is evaluated using real-world outage records from Michigan, and results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS |

Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This prune-then-finetune paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

Trained on massive corpora of data, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, summarization, and reasoning, transforming how intelligent systems process and interact with human language. Although LLMs may still seem like a recent breakthrough, the field is already witnessing the rise of a new and more general category: multi-modal, multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs). These models go beyond language and can process heterogeneous data types/modalities, such as time-series measurements, audio, imagery, tabular records, and unstructured logs, while supporting a broad range of downstream tasks spanning forecasting, classification, control, and retrieval. When combined with federated learning (FL), they give rise to M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs): a highly recent and largely unexplored class of models that enable scalable, privacy-preserving model training/fine-tuning across distributed data sources. In this paper, we take one of the first steps toward introducing these models to the power systems research community by offering a bidirectional perspective: (i) M3T FedFMs for smart grids and (ii) smart grids for FedFMs. In the former, we explore how M3T FedFMs can enhance key grid functions, such as load/demand forecasting and fault detection, by learning from distributed, heterogeneous data available at the grid edge in a privacy-preserving manner. In the latter, we investigate how the constraints and structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory dimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs.</p></details> |  |

Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Symbolic Computation vis Hash Consing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20534v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation, simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster, function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100 times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in AI-driven pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as a synthesis between symbolic and distributed approaches to language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11856v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the middle of the 20th century, a fierce battle is being fought between symbolic and distributed approaches to language and cognition. The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the distributed camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. In this position paper, I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both distributed/continuous/fuzzy and symbolic/discrete/categorical-like representations and processing; 2) models trained on language make use of this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it makes them particularly interesting for the study of language.

At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scalable and Approximation-free Symbolic Control for Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19859v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Generalization in Pre-Trained Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19849v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Formal Theory on the Logical Limits of Symbol Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Operator-induced Symbolic Regression Trees for Structural Learning of Scientific Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19710v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Scientific Machine Learning has heralded a transformative era in scientific discovery, driving progress across diverse domains. Central to this progress is uncovering scientific laws from experimental data through symbolic regression. However, existing approaches are dominated by heuristic algorithms or data-hungry black-box methods, which often demand low-noise settings and lack principled uncertainty quantification. Motivated by interpretable Statistical Artificial Intelligence, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for symbolic regression that represents scientific laws as ensembles of tree-structured symbolic expressions endowed with a regularized tree prior. This coherent probabilistic formulation enables full posterior inference via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, yielding a balance between predictive accuracy and structural parsimony. To guide symbolic model selection, we develop a marginal posterior-based criterion adhering to the Occam's window principle and further quantify structural fidelity to ground truth through a tailored expression-distance metric. On the theoretical front, we establish near-minimax rate of Bayesian posterior concentration, providing the first rigorous guarantee in context of symbolic regression. Empirical evaluation demonstrates robust performance of our proposed methodology against state-of-the-art competing modules on a simulated example, a suite of canonical Feynman equations, and single-atom catalysis dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

| **[Symbol-Temporal Consistency Self-supervised Learning for Robust Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19654v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance where significant data shifting exists.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, IEEE-EMBS BSN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic Feedforward Networks for Probabilistic Finite Automata: Exact Simulation and Learnability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10034v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction, $\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation, and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and deep learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18041v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches, which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling, hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However, these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%, especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step compositional reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymRTLO: Enhancing RTL Code Optimization with LLMs and Neuron-Inspired Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10369v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Symbol Detection in Inter-Symbol Interference Channels using Expectation Propagation with Channel Shortening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17735v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative message passing detection based on expectation propagation(EP) has demonstrated near-optimum performance in many signal processing and communication scenarios. The method remains feasible even for channel impulse responses (CIRs), where the optimal Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) detector is infeasible. However, significant performance degradation occurs for channels with strong inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the initial linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimate is inaccurate. We propose an EP-based detector that operates in a transformed signal space obtained by channel shortening. Specifically, instead of the conventional approach that iterates between an LMMSE estimator and a non-linear symbol-wise demapper, the proposed method iterates between a linear channel shortening filter-based estimator and a nonlinear BCJR detector with reduced memory compared to the actual channel. Additionally, we propose a deliberate mismatch between the initialized messages and the initialized covariance used in the linear estimator in the first iteration for faster convergence. The proposed approach is evaluated for the well-known Proakis-C ISI channel and for CIRs from a wireless measurement campaign. We demonstrate improvements of up to 6dB at 2 bits per channel use and an improved performance-complexity trade-off over conventional EP-based detection.</p></details> | Submitted to ICASSP |

However, generating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving performance nuances. The proposed model has been evaluated using the Maestro dataset and has demonstrated improvements in generating coherent and diverse music, characterized by both structural consistency and expressive variation. The project demos and the generated music samples can be accessed through the link: https://perceivers.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barwise Section Boundary Detection in Symbolic Music Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16566v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for Music Structure Analysis (MSA) focus primarily on audio data. While symbolic music can be synthesized into audio and analyzed using existing MSA techniques, such an approach does not exploit symbolic music's rich explicit representation of pitch, timing, and instrumentation. A key subproblem of MSA is section boundary detection-determining whether a given point in time marks the transition between musical sections. In this paper, we study automatic section boundary detection for symbolic music. First, we introduce a human-annotated MIDI dataset for section boundary detection, consisting of metadata from 6134 MIDI files that we manually curated from the Lakh MIDI dataset. Second, we train a deep learning model to classify the presence of section boundaries within a fixed-length musical window. Our data representation involves a novel encoding scheme based on synthesized overtones to encode arbitrary MIDI instrumentations into 3-channel piano rolls. Our model achieves an F1 score of 0.77, improving over the analogous audio-based supervised learning approach and the unsupervised block-matching segmentation (CBM) audio approach by 0.22 and 0.31, respectively. We release our dataset, code, and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Powered Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13452v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, offering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem provers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently approximate by nature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy and scale of analysis in real-world applications. Such issues often necessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token limits, but this requires enterprise-grade hardware (GPUs) and thus limits accessibility for many users. In this paper, we propose LLM-based symbolic execution -- a novel approach that enhances LLM inference via a path-based decomposition of the program analysis tasks into smaller (more tractable) subtasks. The core idea is to generalize path constraints using a generic code-based representation that the LLM can directly reason over, and without translation into another (less-expressive) formal language. We implement our approach in the form of AutoBug, an LLM-based symbolic execution engine that is lightweight and language-agnostic, making it a practical tool for analyzing code that is challenging for traditional approaches. We show that AutoBug can improve both the accuracy and scale of LLM-based program analysis, especially for smaller LLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, published in "Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications" (OOPSLA), 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs, and typically rely on additional features (e.g., primitive types or graphical layers) to improve performance. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with only coordinate attributes, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique that combines weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale dataset comprising 45 finely annotated floorplans, each covering approximately 1,000 $m^2$, significantly larger than prior benchmarks. LS-CAD will be publicly released to support future research. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD demonstrate that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also showcase its practical value by enabling automated parametric 3D interior reconstruction directly from raw CAD inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16pag...</summary><p>16pages, 14 figures, Project web-page: https://dgeneai.github.io/cadspotting-pages/</p></details> |

Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning. Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across five real-world conditions.

Each of these two features has been addressed separately in prior work. Combining these two features poses a challenge in learning the outputs corresponding to potentially infinite sets of input characters at each state. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of essential input characters, a finite set of input characters that is sufficient for learning the output function of a symbolic Mealy automaton. $\Lambda^*_M$ maintains an underapproximation of the essential input characters and refines this set during learning. We prove that $\Lambda^*_M$ terminates under certain assumptions. Moreover, we provide upper and lower bounds for the query complexity. Their similarity suggests the tightness of the bounds. We empirically demonstrate that $\Lambda^*_M$ is i) efficient regarding the number of queries on practical benchmarks and ii) scalable according to evaluations with randomly generated benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICTAC 2025</p></details> |

In current 5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for communication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In this paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly switches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each beamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while maintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement Chameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments in open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with a sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon employs a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\mu}s, therefore producing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine learning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of 0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\deg} (angle), and material classification with 99.0% accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main), 9+6 pages</p></details> |

However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. In this study, we propose a vector symbolic architecture-based OGM system (VSA-OGM) that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while reducing latency by approximately 45x and memory by 400x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 5.5x. Moreover, we achieve up to 6x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training. This work demonstrates the potential of vector symbolic architectures as a practical foundation for real-time probabilistic mapping in autonomous systems operating under strict computational and latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and automated smart contract auditing.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FROM 2025, arXiv:2509.11877</p></details> |

We introduce the task of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis, which requires inferring the symbolic constraints that characterise worst-case program executions; these constraints can be solved to obtain inputs that expose performance bottlenecks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities in software systems. We show that even state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) struggle when applied directly on this task. To address this challenge, we propose WARP, an innovative neurosymbolic approach that computes worst-case constraints on smaller concrete input sizes using existing program analysis tools, and then leverages LLMs to generalise these constraints to larger input sizes. Concretely, WARP comprises: (1) an incremental strategy for LLM-based worst-case reasoning, (2) a solver-aligned neurosymbolic framework that integrates reinforcement learning with SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving, and (3) a curated dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that WARP consistently improves performance on worst-case constraint reasoning. Leveraging the curated constraint dataset, we use reinforcement learning to fine-tune a model, WARP-1.0-3B, which significantly outperforms size-matched and even larger baselines. These results demonstrate that incremental constraint reasoning enhances LLMs' ability to handle symbolic reasoning and highlight the potential for deeper integration between neural learning and formal methods in rigorous program analysis.</p></details> |  |

The error-correcting capability of the symbol-pair code is determined by its minimum symbol-pair distance. For such codes, the larger the minimum symbol-pair distance, the better. It is a challenging task to construct symbol-pair codes with optimal parameters, especially, maximum-distance-separable (MDS) symbol-pair codes. In this paper, the permutation equivalence codes of matrix-product codes with underlying matrices of orders $3$ and $4$ are used to extend the minimum symbol-pair distance, four new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes and a new class of AMDS symbol-pair codes are derived.</p></details> | 24 pages,1 table |

We argue that a key ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding true causal inference.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Vision Language Models and Symbolic Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11862v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[A unit-based symbolic execution method for detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04258v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory corruption is a serious class of software vulnerabilities, which requires careful attention to be detected and removed from applications before getting exploited and harming the system users. Symbolic execution is a well-known method for analyzing programs and detecting various vulnerabilities, e.g., memory corruption. Although this method is sound and complete in theory, it faces some challenges, such as path explosion, when applied to real-world complex programs. In this paper, we present a method for improving the efficiency of symbolic execution and detecting four classes of memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes, i.e., heap-based buffer overflow, stack-based buffer overflow, use-after-free, and double-free. We perform symbolic execution only on test units rather than the whole program to lower the chance of path explosion. In our method, test units are considered parts of the program's code, which might contain vulnerable statements and are statically identified based on the specifications of memory corruption vulnerabilities. Then, each test unit is symbolically executed to calculate path and vulnerability constraints of each statement of the unit, which determine the conditions on unit input data for executing that statement or activating vulnerabilities in it, respectively. Solving these constraints gives us input values for the test unit, which execute the desired statements and reveal vulnerabilities in them. Finally, we use machine learning to approximate the correlation between system and unit input data. Thereby, we generate system inputs that enter the program, reach vulnerable instructions in the desired test unit, and reveal vulnerabilities in them. This method is implemented as a plugin for angr framework and evaluated using a group of benchmark programs. The experiments show its superiority over similar tools in accuracy and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Small, Plan Smart: Minimalist Symbolic Abstraction and Heuristic Subspace Search for LLM-Guided Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15214v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable task planning is pivotal for achieving long-horizon autonomy in real-world robotic systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising interface for translating complex and ambiguous natural language instructions into actionable plans. However, their probabilistic and opaque nature often leads to logically inconsistent or infeasible outputs. To address these limitations, recent frameworks combine LLMs with symbolic planners by first generating action models (Planning Domain Definition Language) and then applying heuristic search. Although promising, such systems still suffer from representation redundancy and exponential search complexity, often resulting in inefficient or overly long plans. To improve planning efficiency and effectiveness, we propose PLAHX (Planning from Language using Abstraction and Heuristic eXploration), a two-stage LLM-symbolic planning framework that integrates abstract symbolic representations with meta-heuristic subspace search in a parallel and iterative fashion. Rather than relying on verbose LLM-generated domain models, we introduce a minimalist symbolic abstraction pipeline that preserves semantic fidelity while eliminating redundancy. Our approach redefines LLM-symbolic planning not by making LLMs smarter, but by reducing the symbolic search space adaptively. Empirical results across four challenging domains, including block stacking and robotic mobile grasping, show that our approach improves the success rate by 21.47% on average, while reducing token consumption by 13% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Intelligence in Disassembly: Multimodal Perception Cross-validation and Continual Learning in Neuro-Symbolic TAMP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11270v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, the efficient disassembly and recycling of power batteries have become a critical challenge for the circular economy. In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harmful Prompt Laundering: Jailbreaking LLMs with Abductive Styles and Symbolic Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10931v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[From Grounding to Skolemization: A Logic-Constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture for Complex Query Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10837v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs), typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Symbolic Finite Transducers: Formalization and Applications to String Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07203v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite Automata (FAs) are fundamental components in the domains of programming languages. For instance, regular expressions, which are pivotal in languages such as JavaScript and Python, are frequently implemented using FAs. Finite Transducers (FTs) extend the capabilities of FAs by enabling the transformation of input strings into output strings, thereby providing a more expressive framework for operations that encompass both recognition and transformation. Despite the various formalizations of FAs in proof assistants such as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, these formalizations often fall short in terms of applicability to real-world scenarios. A more pragmatic approach involves the formalization of symbolic FAs and FTs, where transition labels are symbolic and potentially infinite. While the formalization of symbolic FAs has been explored in the work of CertiStr, the formalization of symbolic FTs in interactive proof assistants remains largely unexplored due to the increased complexity challenges. In this paper, we aim to formalize symbolic FTs within the Isabelle/HOL framework. This formalization is refinement-based and is designed to be extensible with various symbolic representations of transition labels. To assess its performance, we applied the formalized symbolic FTs to an SMT string solver for modeling replacement operations. The experimental results indicate that the formalized symbolic transducer can efficiently and effectively solve string constraints with replacement operations.</p></details> | Conference |

Symbolic regression searches for mathematical equations that best fit a given dataset and is commonly solved with genetic programming approaches. We show that by using deep learning techniques, more specific KANs, and combining them with simplification strategies such as translational symmetries and separabilities, we are able to recover ground-truth equations of the Feynman Symbolic Regression for Scientific Discovery (SRSD) dataset. Additionally, we show that by combining the proposed framework with neural controlled differential equations, we are able to model the dynamics of an in-silico bioprocess system precisely, opening the door for the dynamic modeling of other engineering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering physical laws with parallel symbolic enumeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04405v4)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression plays a crucial role in modern scientific research thanks to its capability of discovering concise and interpretable mathematical expressions from data. A key challenge lies in the search for parsimonious and generalizable mathematical formulas, in an infinite search space, while intending to fit the training data. Existing algorithms have faced a critical bottleneck of accuracy and efficiency over a decade when handling problems of complexity, which essentially hinders the pace of applying symbolic regression for scientific exploration across interdisciplinary domains. To this end, we introduce parallel symbolic enumeration (PSE) to efficiently distill generic mathematical expressions from limited data. Experiments show that PSE achieves higher accuracy and faster computation compared to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms across over 200 synthetic and experimental problem sets (e.g., improving the recovery accuracy by up to 99% and reducing runtime by an order of magnitude). PSE represents an advance in accurate and efficient data-driven discovery of symbolic, interpretable models (e.g., underlying physical laws), and improves the scalability of symbolic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoStub: Genetic Programming-Based Stub Creation for Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08524v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.</p></details> | 2025 HUMIES finalist |
| **[Symbolic regression via MDLformer-guided search: from minimizing prediction error to minimizing description length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03753v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression, a task discovering the formula best fitting the given data, is typically based on the heuristical search. These methods usually update candidate formulas to obtain new ones with lower prediction errors iteratively. However, since formulas with similar function shapes may have completely different symbolic forms, the prediction error does not decrease monotonously as the search approaches the target formula, causing the low recovery rate of existing methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel search objective based on the minimum description length, which reflects the distance from the target and decreases monotonically as the search approaches the correct form of the target formula. To estimate the minimum description length of any input data, we design a neural network, MDLformer, which enables robust and scalable estimation through large-scale training. With the MDLformer's output as the search objective, we implement a symbolic regression method, SR4MDL, that can effectively recover the correct mathematical form of the formula. Extensive experiments illustrate its excellent performance in recovering formulas from data. Our method successfully recovers around 50 formulas across two benchmark datasets comprising 133 problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 43.92%. Experiments on 122 unseen black-box problems further demonstrate its generalization performance. We release our code at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SR4MDL .</p></details> |  |

The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges for internally decomposed polyhedra with the minimal number of added internal edges. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Symbolic Triggers of Hallucination in Gemma Models Across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09715v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem. However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B, reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities (ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets. These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models, pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such inputs--regardless of their scale.</p></details> |  |

Investigating the internal reasoning mechanisms of these models can help us design better model architectures and training strategies, ultimately enhancing their reasoning capability. In this study, we constructed a symbolic multi-step reasoning task to investigate the information propagation mechanisms in Transformer models when solving the task through direct answering and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We introduced the concept of buffer mechanism: the model stores various information in distinct buffers and selectively extracts it through the query-key matrix. We proposed a random matrix-based algorithm to enhance the model's reasoning ability. This algorithm introduces only 132 trainable parameters, yet leads to significant performance improvements on 7 multi-step reasoning datasets, including PrOntoQA, LogicAsker, and LogicInference. These findings provide new insights into understanding the large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v6)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Combining the reasoning capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve, lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper, we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog}, \textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this problem in novel ways.</p></details> |  |

Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning 2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps, computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging graph signal processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment, adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures, while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Methods for the Cross-Level Verification of SystemC Peripherals with Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05504v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Prototypes (VPs) are important tools in modern hardware development. At high abstractions, they are often implemented in SystemC and offer early analysis of increasingly complex designs. These complex designs often combine one or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in hardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a well-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction levels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be seamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in the SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the SystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely, and would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems like peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a versatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC kernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our extensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different levels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated for (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In comparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel and peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level Modelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling cross-level verification with symbolic execution.</p></details> |  |

MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |

We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (32 pages, 12 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/SGP-Gen/)</p></details> |

However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |

At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. We next investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme. The results are evaluated on a simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scale model vessel.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Integration for Physics-informed Symbolic Regression Using Pre-trained Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03036v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve performance.</p></details> |  |

This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve these improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single Domain Generalization in Diabetic Retinopathy: A Neuro-Symbolic Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02918v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings, thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably, our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios. Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy) substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ANSyA 2025: 1st International Workshop on Advanced Neuro-Symbolic Applications</p></details> |

To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[ViSymRe: Vision-guided Multimodal Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11139v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting simple mathematical expression from an observational dataset to describe complex natural phenomena is one of the core objectives of artificial intelligence (AI). This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). Traditional SR models are based on genetic programming (GP) or reinforcement learning (RL), facing well-known challenges, such as low efficiency and overfitting. Recent studies have integrated SR with large language models (LLMs), enabling fast zero-shot inference by learning mappings from millions of dataset-expression pairs. However, since the input and output are inherently different modalities, such models often struggle to converge effectively. In this paper, we introduce ViSymRe, a vision-guided multimodal SR model that incorporates the third resource, expression graph, to bridge the modality gap. Different from traditional multimodal models, ViSymRe is trained to extract vision, termed virtual vision, from datasets, without relying on the global availability of expression graphs, which addresses the essential challenge of visual SR, i.e., expression graphs are not available during inference. Evaluation results on multiple mainstream benchmarks show that ViSymRe achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art dataset-only baselines. The expressions predicted by ViSymRe not only fit the dataset well but are also simple and structurally accurate, goals that SR models strive to achieve.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed research direction combines symbolic and subsymbolic artificial intelligence, leveraging both knowledge graphs and rule learning.

It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression (MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models. We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

Building on SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), the approach addresses key limitations through four enhancements. First, symbolic parameterisation enables physical parameters to vary within unified regression. Second, the Dimensional Similarity Filter enforces unit consistency while reducing candidate libraries. Third, memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enables batch processing of large datasets. Fourth, ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis ensures robust model identification. Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates consistent discovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered Burgers datasets, the framework autonomously discovers the SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} = 0.1604\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$ with the SINDy-discovered Smagorinsky constant $C_s^{\text{SINDy}} \approx 0.4005$ without predefined closure assumptions, recovering Smagorinsky-type structure directly from data. The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.885$ across filter scales and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical SGS closures. The ability of the framework to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling methods, contributing to the broader field of data-driven turbulence closure discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training. We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors. Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often focus on short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph, discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and interpretable decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CoRL 2025; to appear in PMLR</p></details> |

We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Learning of Constraints and Objective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20978v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with. Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems. Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy. Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amadeus: Autoregressive Model with Bidirectional Attribute Modelling for Symbolic Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20665v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework. Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up. Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and fine-tuning.</p></details> | Under review |

As several methods are available in the literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third, whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also based on standard definitions).</p></details> |  |

Previous detection methods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often struggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel framework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which implements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning optimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces a paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the detection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws for detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial interactions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using agent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts, and simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural language representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average. SALF also refines detectors, improving detection of refined content by up to 7.7%. We hope our work inspires further exploration into more robust, adaptable fake news detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic Equation Modeling of Composite Loads: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network based Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19612v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing penetration of distributed energy resources installed behind the meter, there is a growing need for adequate modelling of composite loads to enable accurate power system simulation analysis. Existing measurement based load modeling methods either fit fixed-structure physical models, which limits adaptability to evolving load mixes, or employ flexible machine learning methods which are however black boxes and offer limited interpretability. This paper presents a new learning based load modelling method based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks towards modelling flexibility and interpretability. By actively learning activation functions on edges, KANs automatically derive free form symbolic equations that capture nonlinear relationships among measured variables without prior assumptions about load structure. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other methods in both accuracy and generalization ability, while uniquely representing composite loads into transparent, interpretable mathematical equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Symbolic Regression via Foundation Model Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19487v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering interpretable mathematical equations from observed data (a.k.a. equation discovery or symbolic regression) is a cornerstone of scientific discovery, enabling transparent modeling of physical, biological, and economic systems. While foundation models pre-trained on large-scale equation datasets offer a promising starting point, they often suffer from negative transfer and poor generalization when applied to small, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we introduce EQUATE (Equation Generation via QUality-Aligned Transfer Embeddings), a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts foundation models for symbolic equation discovery in low-data regimes via distillation. EQUATE combines symbolic-numeric alignment with evaluator-guided embedding optimization, enabling a principled embedding-search-generation paradigm. Our approach reformulates discrete equation search as a continuous optimization task in a shared embedding space, guided by data-equation fitness and simplicity. Experiments across three standard public benchmarks (Feynman, Strogatz, and black-box datasets) demonstrate that EQUATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while preserving low complexity and fast inference. These results highlight EQUATE as a practical and generalizable solution for data-efficient symbolic regression in foundation model distillation settings.</p></details> |  |

Unlike post-hoc explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition, and symbolic reasoning in neural models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Toward Generalized Autonomous Agents: A Neuro-Symbolic AI Framework for Integrating Social and Technical Support in Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18406v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems, meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer' agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[modelSolver: A Symbolic Model-Driven Solver for Power Network Simulation and Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17882v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of advanced software tools for power system analysis requires extensive programming expertise. Even when using open-source tools, programming skills are essential to modify built-in models. This can be particularly challenging for domain experts who lack coding proficiency. This paper introduces modelSolver, a software solution with a new framework centered around symbolic mathematical modeling. The proposed paradigm facilitates defining models through intuitive mathematical expressions, thus eliminating the need for traditional programming constructs such as arrays, loops, and sparse matrix computations. The modelSolver focuses on power flow and state estimation using an open-box approach, which allows users to specify custom models using either real or complex variables. Unlike existing tools that rely on hard-coded models, modelSolver enables the representation of a wide range of advanced functionalities, including power flow with voltage regulators and load tap changers, continuation power flow, and Gauss-Newton state estimation with equality constraints. Compatibility with MATPOWER is ensured via a converter that automates importing data files. The framework prioritizes model-driven development and empowers domain experts to focus on power system modeling without programming barriers. It aims to simplify power system computations, making them more accessible to students, scientists, and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[DivLogicEval: A Framework for Benchmarking Logical Reasoning Evaluation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15587v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025.

However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second, an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the crucial dimension of explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can GRPO Boost Complex Multimodal Table Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16889v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment.

Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.

The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>We in...</summary><p>We intend to substantially revise the problem statement and scope; therefore we withdraw the current version</p></details> |

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach that involves a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive solution for audio logical reasoning (ALR) tasks: we introduce SoundMind, a dataset of 6,446 audio-text annotated samples specifically curated to support complex reasoning. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to equip audio-language models with robust audio-text reasoning capabilities. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the proposed SoundMind dataset using SoundMind-RL, we achieve strong and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SoundMind benchmark.

While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption across and within different collaborative and social contexts.

Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer.</p></details> |  |

The data format, named cognitive-logs, enables rigour and flexible logical reasoning. Cognitive-logs consist of a set of relational and graph databases. Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of "actions" represented by verbs in natural languages and "participants" who perform the actions. These objects are connected by arrows (morphisms) that bind each action to its participant and bind causes and effects. The design principle of cognitive-logs refers cognitive sciences especially in cognitive linguistics. Logical reasoning is the processes of comparing causal chains in episodic memories with known rules which are also recorded in the cognitive-logs. Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories. The goal of this study is to develop a database-driven artificial intelligence that thinks like a human but possesses the accuracy and rigour of a machine. The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences. Cognitive-logs also serve as a model of human cognition mind activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71.

In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main), 9+6 pages</p></details> |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages |

We measured the accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June 2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025. We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15 billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3, an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted as a main track paper for publication in the proceedings of the Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025 held in Canberra, Australia</p></details> |
| **[LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14089v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Traffic-MLLM: A Spatio-Temporal MLLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Causal Inference in Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11165v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[NIRS: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies as alternatives to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal is to develop NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences. Results: The ontology has 129 classes, 11 object properties, and 17 data properties across 886 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 361 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes: for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation. Conclusion: We developed an ontology that captures NIRS modalities in a unified framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies, which may need to be expanded to encompass a broader scope.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Effects of Argumentation Theory, Audio Modality and Data Enrichment on LLM-Based Fallacy Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11127v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S. presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall, basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy classification in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side. The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Constraint LLM Agents for Text-to-Model Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08970v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reasoning Quality in Large Language Models through Enhanced Chain-of-Thought via RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06024v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer. Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.</p></details> |  |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings. 23 pages, 23 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Sensitivity and Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language (NL) statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text, often go unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based metrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding ground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of FOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator and text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric sensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics against LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation affects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL metric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between BertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 19th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning, 2025</p></details> |

This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).</p></details> |  |

Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATQuest: A Verifier for Logical Reasoning Evaluation and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00930v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional, systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, many complex real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |

However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models (LLMs) for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20030v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to simplify and even automate the entire workflow.

| **[GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR camera ready + additional discussion in the appendix</p></details> |
| **[Logical Reasoning with Outcome Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19903v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

In this paper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule interactions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs, they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and their interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication at the IEEE Transactions on Games 2024, Special Issue on Large Language Models and Games (10 pages excluding appendix, 3 figures)</p></details> |

A Multi-Dimensional Truthfulness Evaluation of Quantized LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19432v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025 main conference (poster)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model-Driven Closed-Loop UAV Operation with Semantic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01930v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop LLM-driven UAV operation code generation framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into semantic trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLP 2025, part of ECPTS</p></details> |
| **[From Indirect Object Identification to Syllogisms: Exploring Binary Mechanisms in Transformer Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16109v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks, and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g., "Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient RL Training for Reasoning Models via Length-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12284v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</p></details> | Under review |

In this work, we investigate their capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity. Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification, outperforming Mathematica in various cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think in Blocks: Adaptive Reasoning from Direct Response to Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15507v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Inference for Datalog with Correlated Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15166v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog, integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving, static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis, demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers tight probability bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at OOPSLA 2025 (R2)</p></details> |
| **[Deliberate Reasoning in Language Models as Structure-Aware Planning with an Accurate World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03136v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.</p></details> | ACL25 (main) |
| **[LLM4VV: Evaluating Cutting-Edge LLMs for Generation and Evaluation of Directive-Based Parallel Programming Model Compiler Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet. Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.</p></details> |  |
| **[PC-Sampler: Position-Aware Calibration of Decoding Bias in Masked Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13021v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless, our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling (PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/PC-Sampler.</p></details> | 17 pages,13 figures |

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore, EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted problems.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing reasoning datasets often either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book), containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus, and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-4B models.</p></details> |  |

As a result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface, medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks, outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yuh-zha/Vision-G1.</p></details> |  |

The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> |  |

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and computational operations via executable code. This approach not only facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations, all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation, followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20 benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains, particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thyme-vl.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines.

In the first stage, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.</p></details> |  |
| **[URO-Bench: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation for End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17810v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in end-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs). In contrast to text-based LLMs, the evaluation framework for SDMs should encompass both cognitive dimensions (e.g., logical reasoning, knowledge) and speech-related aspects (e.g., paralinguistic cues, audio quality). However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To address this gap, we propose URO-Bench, an extensive benchmark for SDMs. Notably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is divided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, each comprising 20 test sets, evaluating the spoken dialogue model's abilities in Understanding, Reasoning, and Oral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed benchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA tasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in advanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding remains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. We hope that URO-Bench can facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models by providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track progress in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models using Confidence Disparities in Coreference Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07111v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns. Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly, coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers, indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social harm.</p></details> |  |

But how can these advances be directed toward empowering junior researchers and designers who often require additional help to build and express their professional and personal identities? We introduce Frontend Diffusion, a multi-agent coding system transforming user-drawn layouts and textual prompts into refined website code, thereby supporting self-representation goals. A user study with 13 junior researchers and designers shows AI as a human capability enhancer rather than a replacement, and highlights the importance of bidirectional human-AI alignment. We then discuss future work such as leveraging AI for career development and fostering bidirectional human-AI alignment of multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GreenMind: A Next-Generation Vietnamese Large Language Model for Structured and Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16832v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a robust approach for tackling LLM tasks that require intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating a final answer. In this paper, we present GreenMind-Medium-14B-R1, the Vietnamese reasoning model inspired by the finetuning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. We also leverage a high-quality Vietnamese synthesized reasoning dataset and design two reward functions to tackle the main limitations of this technique: (i) language mixing, where we explicitly detect the presence of biased language characters during the process of sampling tokens, and (ii) we leverage Sentence Transformer-based models to ensure that the generated reasoning content maintains factual correctness and does not distort the final output. Experimental results on the Vietnamese dataset from the VLSP 2023 Challenge demonstrate that our model outperforms prior works and enhances linguistic consistency in its responses. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation to SeaExam-a multilingual multiple-choice dataset, showing the effectiveness of our reasoning method compared to few-shot prompting techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextGuard-LVLM: Enhancing News Veracity through Fine-grained Cross-modal Contextual Consistency Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06623v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem, which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this, we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.</p></details> |  |

A model modified through this framework demonstrated improved perplexity scores, greater lexical variability, and enhanced consistency in logical reasoning, suggesting that structured parameter distribution contributes to more efficient language representation. Statistical analyses of generated text highlighted a wider range of sentence structures and reduced redundancy in token selection, indicating that encapsulation fosters more adaptable language generation. A detailed evaluation of attention weight distributions revealed that the experimental model exhibited greater divergence in cross-layer activations, supporting the hypothesis that encapsulated neurons assume specialized processing roles. Logical consistency assessments further demonstrated that modular architectures mitigate contradictory outputs, reducing internal conflicts in inferred relationships between linguistic constructs. Computational trade-offs were analyzed, with results showing a minor increase in processing overhead, though improvements in parameter efficiency and structured decision-making compensated for the additional complexity. The mathematical formulation of the encapsulation mechanism confirmed that modular aggregation maintains stable convergence properties while promoting distinct functional roles for different neuron clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[SABER: Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10026v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning (LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4% and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoLaux: A Benchmark for Evaluating MLLMs' Geometry Performance on Long-Step Problems Requiring Auxiliary Lines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06226v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation, and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs' long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51 reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13 leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop). Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in supplementary materials and will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Method-Based Reasoning for Large Language Models: Extraction, Reuse, and Continuous Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04289v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of language tasks. However, their reasoning process is primarily guided by statistical patterns in training data, which limits their ability to handle novel problems and perform consistent logical reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method-based model that enhances LLMs with explicit, reusable procedures extracted from training content, generated responses, and user interactions. Each method is represented as a pair consisting of a problem and its corresponding solution, stored externally and ranked based on feedback. When a new query is received, the system retrieves and applies the most relevant methods to guide the LLM's response. Our model enables continual learning, method reuse, and logical consistency beyond next-token prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the system improves factual verification and generalization in complex prompts, and that newly learned methods can outperform earlier ones through user-driven refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI for Object-Oriented Programming: Writing the Right Code and Reasoning the Right Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05005v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine, and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately enhancing the programming experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization, particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective strategy for strengthening SLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Recommendation with Simulated Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14147v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in explainable recommendation have greatly bolstered user experience by elucidating the decision-making rationale. However, the existing methods actually fail to provide effective feedback signals for potentially better or worse generated explanations due to their reliance on traditional supervised learning paradigms in sparse interaction data. To address these issues, we propose a novel human-like feedback-driven optimization framework. This framework employs a dynamic interactive optimization mechanism for achieving human-centered explainable requirements without incurring high labor costs. Specifically, we propose to utilize large language models (LLMs) as human simulators to predict human-like feedback for guiding the learning process. To enable the LLMs to deeply understand the task essence and meet user's diverse personalized requirements, we introduce a human-induced customized reward scoring method, which helps stimulate the language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, considering the potential conflicts between different perspectives of explanation quality, we introduce a principled Pareto optimization that transforms the multi-perspective quality enhancement task into a multi-objective optimization problem for improving explanation performance. At last, to achieve efficient model training, we design an off-policy optimization pipeline. By incorporating a replay buffer and addressing the data distribution biases, we can effectively improve data utilization and enhance model generality. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15787v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04339v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research.

| **[A Comparative Study of Neurosymbolic AI Approaches to Interpretable Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03366v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeSy 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IJCAI 2025 (CCF A)</p></details> |
| **[Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23541v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Categorical Construction of Logically Verifiable Neural Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11647v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with reliable logical reasoning, often violating basic logical principles during inference. We address this limitation by developing a categorical framework that systematically constructs neural architectures with provable logical guarantees. Our approach treats logical theories as algebraic structures called Lawvere theories, which we transform into neural networks using categorical algebra in the 2-category of parametric maps. Unlike existing methods that impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints, enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop Invariant Generation: A Hybrid Framework of Reasoning optimised LLMs and SMT Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00419v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100% coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133, while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be generalizable to other imperative languages.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EVINET: Towards Open-World Graph Learning via Evidential Reasoning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07288v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX.

| **[A Survey on Large Language Model Acceleration based on KV Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19442v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

| **[On the Limits of Hierarchically Embedded Logic in Classical Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness. This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination, repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in future development of language models.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning through Visual and Textual Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Mathematical Proof Generation Using Large Language Model Agents and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11657v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning capabilities, such as automated theorem proving. However, challenges persist within theorem proving, such as the identification of key mathematical concepts, understanding their interrelationships, and formalizing proofs correctly within natural language. We present KG-prover, a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs mined from reputable mathematical texts to augment general-purpose LLMs to construct and formalize mathematical proofs. We also study the effects of scaling graph-based, test-time compute using KG-Prover, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines across multiple datasets. General-purpose LLMs improve up to 21\% on miniF2F-test when combined with KG-Prover, with consistent improvements ranging from 2-11\% on the ProofNet, miniF2F-test, and MUSTARD datasets without additional scaling. Furthermore, KG-Prover with o4-mini achieves over 50% miniF2F-test. This work provides a promising approach for augmenting natural language proof reasoning with knowledge graphs without the need for additional finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML AI4Math Workshop 2025, NAACL SRW 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Solve ASP Problems? Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks: ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and \emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively.

| **[Augmented Vision-Language Models: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22933v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining. Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can One Domain Help Others? A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 24 figures |
| **[MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17476v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning for Robust Instruction Following in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22074v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVA-CoT: Let Vision Language Models Reason Step-by-Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10440v6)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct. The code, dataset, and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/LLaVA-CoT.</p></details> | 17 pages, ICCV 2025 |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 (Survey Track)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09567v5)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper list and Github tutorial are available at https://github.com/LightChen233/Awesome-Long-Chain-of-Thought-Reasoning.
