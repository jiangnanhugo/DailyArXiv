| **[Long-term prediction of El Niño-Southern Oscillation using reservoir computing with data-driven realtime filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17781v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the application of machine learning approaches to time-series forecasting of climate dynamical phenomena has become increasingly active. It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile toolbox of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities -- including tabular data, text data, images, time series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamentals of non-parametric statistical inference for integrated quantiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17722v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a general non-parametric statistical inference theory for integrals of quantiles without assuming any specific sampling design or dependence structure. Technical considerations are accompanied by examples and discussions, including those pertaining to the bias of empirical estimators. To illustrate how the general results can be adapted to specific situations, we derive - at a stroke and under minimal conditions - consistency and asymptotic normality of the empirical tail-value-at-risk, Lorenz and Gini curves at any probability level in the case of the simple random sampling, thus facilitating a comparison of our results with what is already known in the literature. Notes and references concerning underlying technicalities in the case of dependent (i.e., time series) data are offered. As a by-product, our general results provide new and unified proofs of large-sample properties of a number of classical statistical estimators, such as trimmed means, and give additional insights into the origins of, and the reasons for, various necessary and sufficient conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>66 pa...</summary><p>66 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-free training of recurrent neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23467v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks are a successful neural architecture for many time-dependent problems, including time series analysis, forecasting, and modeling of dynamical systems. Training such networks with backpropagation through time is a notoriously difficult problem because their loss gradients tend to explode or vanish. In this contribution, we introduce a computational approach to construct all weights and biases of a recurrent neural network without using gradient-based methods. The approach is based on a combination of random feature networks and Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems. The hidden parameters of a single recurrent block are sampled at random, while the outer weights are constructed using extended dynamic mode decomposition. This approach alleviates all problems with backpropagation commonly related to recurrent networks. The connection to Koopman operator theory also allows us to start using results in this area to analyze recurrent neural networks. In computational experiments on time series, forecasting for chaotic dynamical systems, and control problems, as well as on weather data, we observe that the training time and forecasting accuracy of the recurrent neural networks we construct are improved when compared to commonly used gradient-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Gap Between Synthetic and Ground Truth Time Series Distributions via Neural Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17553v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce Neural Mapper for Vector Quantized Time Series Generator (NM-VQTSG), a novel method aimed at addressing fidelity challenges in vector quantized (VQ) time series generation. VQ-based methods, such as TimeVQVAE, have demonstrated success in generating time series but are hindered by two critical bottlenecks: information loss during compression into discrete latent spaces and deviations in the learned prior distribution from the ground truth distribution. These challenges result in synthetic time series with compromised fidelity and distributional accuracy. To overcome these limitations, NM-VQTSG leverages a U-Net-based neural mapping model to bridge the distributional gap between synthetic and ground truth time series. To be more specific, the model refines synthetic data by addressing artifacts introduced during generation, effectively aligning the distributions of synthetic and real data. Importantly, NM-VQTSG can be used for synthetic time series generated by any VQ-based generative method. We evaluate NM-VQTSG across diverse datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification archive, demonstrating its capability to consistently enhance fidelity in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. The improvements are evidenced by significant improvements in FID, IS, and conditional FID, additionally backed up by visual inspection in a data space and a latent space. Our findings establish NM-VQTSG as a new method to improve the quality of synthetic time series. Our implementation is available on \url{https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Single-Step and Multi-Step Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17459v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory prediction is a critical time series task in aviation. While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[NF-MKV Net: A Constraint-Preserving Neural Network Approach to Solving Mean-Field Games Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17450v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based methods for solving Mean-Field Games (MFGs) equilibria have garnered significant attention for their effectiveness in high-dimensional problems. However, many algorithms struggle with ensuring that the evolution of the density distribution adheres to the required mathematical constraints. This paper investigates a neural network approach to solving MFGs equilibria through a stochastic process perspective. It integrates process-regularized Normalizing Flow (NF) frameworks with state-policy-connected time-series neural networks to address McKean-Vlasov-type Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (MKV FBSDE) fixed-point problems, equivalent to MFGs equilibria.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to multivariate time series data as a vector autoregression model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17446v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction, but its application to time series data remains limited. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates NMF with a vector autoregression (VAR) model to capture both latent structure and temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data. By representing the NMF coefficient matrix as a VAR model, the framework leverages the interpretability of NMF while incorporating the dynamic characteristics of time series data. This approach allows for the extraction of meaningful features and accurate predictions in time series data.</p></details> | 7 figures |
| **[A large synthetic dataset for machine learning applications in power transmission grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03365v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ongoing energy transition, power grids are evolving fast. They operate more and more often close to their technical limit, under more and more volatile conditions. Fast, essentially real-time computational approaches to evaluate their operational safety, stability and reliability are therefore highly desirable. Machine Learning methods have been advocated to solve this challenge, however they are heavy consumers of training and testing data, while historical operational data for real-world power grids are hard if not impossible to access. This manuscript presents a large synthetic dataset of power injections in an electric transmission grid model of continental Europe, and describes the algorithm developed for its generation. The method allows one to generate arbitrarily large time series from the knowledge of the grid -- the admittance of its lines as well as the location, type and capacity of its power generators -- and aggregated power consumption data, such as the national load data given by ENTSO-E. The obtained datasets are statistically validated against real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Gaze Prediction as a Function of Eye Movement Type and Individual Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00597v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement prediction is a promising area of research with the potential to improve performance and the user experience of systems based on eye-tracking technology. In this study, we analyze individual differences in gaze prediction performance. We use three fundamentally different models within the analysis: the lightweight Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), the transformer-based network for multivariate time series representation learning (TST), and the Oculomotor Plant Mathematical Model wrapped in the Kalman Filter framework (OPKF). Each solution was assessed on different eye-movement types. We show important subject-to-subject variation for all models and eye-movement types. We found that fixation noise is associated with poorer gaze prediction in fixation. For saccades, higher velocities are associated with poorer gaze prediction performance. We think these individual differences are important and propose that future research should report statistics related to inter-subject variation. We also propose that future models should be designed to reduce subject-to-subject variation.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[A 1-D CNN inference engine for constrained platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17269v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1D-CNNs are used for time series classification in various domains with a high degree of accuracy. Most implementations collect the incoming data samples in a buffer before performing inference on it. On edge devices, which are typically constrained and single-threaded, such an implementation may interfere with time-critical tasks. One such task is that of sample acquisition. In this work, we propose an inference scheme that interleaves the convolution operations between sample intervals, which allows us to reduce the inference latency. Furthermore, our scheme is well-suited for storing data in ring buffers, yielding a small memory footprint. We demonstrate these improvements by comparing our approach to TFLite's inference method, giving a 10% reduction in the inference delay while almost halving the memory usage. Our approach is feasible on common consumer devices, which we show using an AVR-based Arduino board and an ARM-based Arduino board.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amplifier: Bringing Attention to Neglected Low-Energy Components in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17216v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an energy amplification technique to address the issue that existing models easily overlook low-energy components in time series forecasting. This technique comprises an energy amplification block and an energy restoration block. The energy amplification block enhances the energy of low-energy components to improve the model's learning efficiency for these components, while the energy restoration block returns the energy to its original level. Moreover, considering that the energy-amplified data typically displays two distinct energy peaks in the frequency spectrum, we integrate the energy amplification technique with a seasonal-trend forecaster to model the temporal relationships of these two peaks independently, serving as the backbone for our proposed model, Amplifier. Additionally, we propose a semi-channel interaction temporal relationship enhancement block for Amplifier, which enhances the model's ability to capture temporal relationships from the perspective of the commonality and specificity of each channel in the data. Extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks consistently demonstrate our model's superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08099v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Benchmarking Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Signal Classification in Simulated Gamma-Ray Burst Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17041v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets, successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into their potential and limitations. This work sets the stage for future investigations to fully realize the advantages of QCNNs in astrophysical data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Accepted for publication in 33rd Euromicro/IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Stack Overflow Meets Replication: Security Research Amid Evolving Code Snippets (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16948v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the impact of Stack Overflow code evolution on the stability of prior research findings derived from Stack Overflow data and provide recommendations for future studies. We systematically reviewed papers published between 2005--2023 to identify key aspects of Stack Overflow that can affect study results, such as the language or context of code snippets. Our analysis reveals that certain aspects are non-stationary over time, which could lead to different conclusions if experiments are repeated at different times. We replicated six studies using a more recent dataset to demonstrate this risk. Our findings show that four papers produced significantly different results than the original findings, preventing the same conclusions from being drawn with a newer dataset version. Consequently, we recommend treating Stack Overflow as a time series data source to provide context for interpreting cross-sectional research conclusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CENTS: Generating synthetic electricity consumption time series for rare and unseen scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14426v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large-scale generative modeling have demonstrated the potential of foundation models in domains such as natural language, computer vision, and protein structure prediction. However, their application in the energy and smart grid sector remains limited due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of high-quality data. In this work, we propose a method for creating high-fidelity electricity consumption time series data for rare and unseen context variables (e.g. location, building type, photovoltaics). Our approach, Context Encoding and Normalizing Time Series Generation, or CENTS, includes three key innovations: (i) A context normalization approach that enables inverse transformation for time series context variables unseen during training, (ii) a novel context encoder to condition any state-of-the-art time-series generator on arbitrary numbers and combinations of context variables, (iii) a framework for training this context encoder jointly with a time-series generator using an auxiliary context classification loss designed to increase expressivity of context embeddings and improve model performance. We further provide a comprehensive overview of different evaluation metrics for generative time series models. Our results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in generating realistic household-level electricity consumption data, paving the way for training larger foundation models in the energy domain on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven vs Traditional Approaches to Power Transformer's Top-Oil Temperature Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16831v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power transformers are subjected to electrical currents and temperature fluctuations that, if not properly controlled, can lead to major deterioration of their insulation system. Therefore, monitoring the temperature of a power transformer is fundamental to ensure a long-term operational life. Models presented in the IEC 60076-7 and IEEE standards, for example, monitor the temperature by calculating the top-oil and the hot-spot temperatures. However, these models are not very accurate and rely on the power transformers' properties. This paper focuses on finding an alternative method to predict the top-oil temperatures given previous measurements. Given the large quantities of data available, machine learning methods for time series forecasting are analyzed and compared to the real measurements and the corresponding prediction of the IEC standard. The methods tested are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) using different combinations of historical measurements. Each of these methods outperformed the IEC 60076-7 model and they are extended to estimate the temperature rise over ambient. To enhance prediction reliability, we explore the application of quantile regression to construct prediction intervals for the expected top-oil temperature ranges. The best-performing model successfully estimates conditional quantiles that provide sufficient coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Relative Positional Encoding in Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16745v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that model how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (Spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks such as sequential modeling and image classifications. However, integrating positional information, which is essential for capturing sequential relationships in data, remains a challenge in Spiking Transformers. In this paper, we introduce an approximate method for relative positional encoding (RPE) in Spiking Transformers, leveraging Gray Code as the foundation for our approach. We provide comprehensive proof of the method's effectiveness in partially capturing relative positional information for sequential tasks. Additionally, we extend our RPE approach by adapting it to a two-dimensional form suitable for image patch processing. We evaluate the proposed RPE methods on several tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that the incorporation of RPE significantly enhances performance by effectively capturing relative positional information.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Assisted Anomaly Detection Service for Site Reliability Engineers: Enhancing Cloud Infrastructure Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16744v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a scalable Anomaly Detection Service with a generalizable API tailored for industrial time-series data, designed to assist Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in managing cloud infrastructure. The service enables efficient anomaly detection in complex data streams, supporting proactive identification and resolution of issues. Furthermore, it presents an innovative approach to anomaly modeling in cloud infrastructure by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand key components, their failure modes, and behaviors. A suite of algorithms for detecting anomalies is offered in univariate and multivariate time series data, including regression-based, mixture-model-based, and semi-supervised approaches. We provide insights into the usage patterns of the service, with over 500 users and 200,000 API calls in a year. The service has been successfully applied in various industrial settings, including IoT-based AI applications. We have also evaluated our system on public anomaly benchmarks to show its effectiveness. By leveraging it, SREs can proactively identify potential issues before they escalate, reducing downtime and improving response times to incidents, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience. We plan to extend the system to include time series foundation models, enabling zero-shot anomaly detection capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI-2025 Deployable AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Explainability and AI Confidence in Clinical Decision Support Systems: Effects on Trust, Diagnostic Performance, and Cognitive Load in Breast Cancer Care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16693v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated potential in healthcare, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and decision-making through Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). However, the successful implementation of these systems relies on user trust and reliance, which can be influenced by explainable AI. This study explores the impact of varying explainability levels on clinicians trust, cognitive load, and diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection. Utilizing an interrupted time series design, we conducted a web-based experiment involving 28 healthcare professionals. The results revealed that high confidence scores substantially increased trust but also led to overreliance, reducing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, low confidence scores decreased trust and agreement while increasing diagnosis duration, reflecting more cautious behavior. Some explainability features influenced cognitive load by increasing stress levels. Additionally, demographic factors such as age, gender, and professional role shaped participants' perceptions and interactions with the system. This study provides valuable insights into how explainability impact clinicians' behavior and decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of designing AI-driven CDSSs that balance transparency, usability, and cognitive demands to foster trust and improve integration into clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Schrödinger Momentum Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16675v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The momentum Schr\"odinger Bridge (mSB) has emerged as a leading method for accelerating generative diffusion processes and reducing transport costs. However, the lack of simulation-free properties inevitably results in high training costs and affects scalability. To obtain a trade-off between transport properties and scalability, we introduce variational Schr\"odinger momentum diffusion (VSMD), which employs linearized forward score functions (variational scores) to eliminate the dependence on simulated forward trajectories. Our approach leverages a multivariate diffusion process with adaptively transport-optimized variational scores. Additionally, we apply a critical-damping transform to stabilize training by removing the need for score estimations for both velocity and samples. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of samples generated with optimal variational scores and momentum diffusion. Empirical results demonstrate that VSMD efficiently generates anisotropic shapes while maintaining transport efficacy, outperforming overdamped alternatives, and avoiding complex denoising processes. Our approach also scales effectively to real-world data, achieving competitive results in time series and image generation.</p></details> | AISTATS 25 |
| **[Bubble Modeling and Tagging: A Stochastic Nonlinear Autoregression Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07038v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economic and financial time series can feature locally explosive behavior when a bubble is formed. The economic or financial bubble, especially its dynamics, is an intriguing topic that has been attracting longstanding attention. To illustrate the dynamics of the local explosion itself, the paper presents a novel, simple, yet useful time series model, called the stochastic nonlinear autoregressive model, which is always strictly stationary and geometrically ergodic and can create long swings or persistence observed in many macroeconomic variables. When a nonlinear autoregressive coefficient is outside of a certain range, the model has periodically explosive behaviors and can then be used to portray the bubble dynamics. Further, the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) of our model is considered, and its strong consistency and asymptotic normality are established under minimal assumptions on innovation. A new model diagnostic checking statistic is developed for model fitting adequacy. In addition, two methods for bubble tagging are proposed, one from the residual perspective and the other from the null-state perspective. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to assess the performances of the QMLE and the two bubble tagging methods in finite samples. Finally, the usefulness of the model is illustrated by an empirical application to the monthly Hang Seng Index.</p></details> | 41 pages, 6 figures |

The WPF problem remains unresolved due to numerous influencing variables, such as wind speed, temperature, latitude, and longitude. Furthermore, achieving high prediction accuracy is crucial for maintaining electric grid stability and ensuring supply security. In this paper, we model all wind turbines within a wind farm as graph nodes in a graph built by their geographical locations. Accordingly, we propose an ensemble model based on graph neural networks and reinforcement learning (EMGRL) for WPF. Our approach includes: (1) applying graph neural networks to capture the time-series data from neighboring wind farms relevant to the target wind farm; (2) establishing a general state embedding that integrates the target wind farm's data with the historical performance of base models on the target wind farm; (3) ensembling and leveraging the advantages of all base models through an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework for WPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models can be effective for forecasting the dynamics of unknown systems from time-series data, but they often require large amounts of data and struggle to generalize across systems with varying dynamics. Combined, these issues make forecasting from short time series particularly challenging. To address this problem, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting from Related Time Series (METAFORS), which uses related systems with longer time-series data to supplement limited data from the system of interest. By leveraging a library of models trained on related systems, METAFORS builds tailored models to forecast system evolution with limited data. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate METAFORS' ability to predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics, even when test and related systems exhibit significantly different behaviors and the available data are scarce, highlighting its robustness and versatility in data-limited scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction.

We present a systematic framework for cross-institutional knowledge transfer in clinical time series, demonstrated through pediatric ventilation management between a general pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a cardiac-focused unit. Using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning, we investigate how different data regimes and fine-tuning strategies affect knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Our results show that while direct model transfer performs poorly, CPC with appropriate fine-tuning enables effective knowledge sharing between institutions, with benefits particularly evident in limited data scenarios. Analysis of transfer patterns reveals an important asymmetry: temporal progression patterns transfer more readily than point-of-care decisions, suggesting practical pathways for cross-institutional deployment. Through a systematic evaluation of fine-tuning approaches and transfer patterns, our work provides insights for developing more generalizable clinical decision support systems while enabling smaller specialized units to leverage knowledge from larger centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'25 |

Inspired by large language models, there is interest in developing large time series models (LTM) to address these issues. However, current methods struggle with training complexity, adapting human feedback, and achieving high predictive accuracy. We introduce TimeHF, a novel pipeline for creating LTMs with 6 billion parameters, incorporating human feedback. We use patch convolutional embedding to capture long time series information and design a human feedback mechanism called time-series policy optimization. Deployed in JD.com's supply chain, TimeHF handles automated replenishment for over 20,000 products, improving prediction accuracy by 33.21% over existing methods.

However, its complex spatial dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics can be challenging for traditional techniques. Existing methods tackle these challenges by learning the two dimensions separately. Here, we introduce Temporal Graphormer (T-Graphormer), a Transformer-based approach capable of modelling spatiotemporal correlations simultaneously. By incorporating temporal dynamics in the Graphormer architecture, each node attends to all other nodes within the graph sequence. Our design enables the model to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns with minimal reliance on predefined spacetime inductive biases. We validate the effectiveness of T-Graphormer on real-world traffic prediction benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, T-Graphormer reduces root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by up to 10%.</p></details> |  |

Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

| **[Guaranteed Multidimensional Time Series Prediction via Deterministic Tensor Completion Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15388v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the prediction of multidimensional time series data has become increasingly important due to its wide-ranging applications. Tensor-based prediction methods have gained attention for their ability to preserve the inherent structure of such data. However, existing approaches, such as tensor autoregression and tensor decomposition, often have consistently failed to provide clear assertions regarding the number of samples that can be exactly predicted. While matrix-based methods using nuclear norms address this limitation, their reliance on matrices limits accuracy and increases computational costs when handling multidimensional data. To overcome these challenges, we reformulate multidimensional time series prediction as a deterministic tensor completion problem and propose a novel theoretical framework. Specifically, we develop a deterministic tensor completion theory and introduce the Temporal Convolutional Tensor Nuclear Norm (TCTNN) model. By convolving the multidimensional time series along the temporal dimension and applying the tensor nuclear norm, our approach identifies the maximum forecast horizon for exact predictions. Additionally, TCTNN achieves superior performance in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods across diverse real-world datasets, including climate temperature, network flow, and traffic ride data. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/TCTNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Transfer Learning Framework for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Traffic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15365v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, rapid technological advancements and expanded Internet access have led to a significant rise in anomalies within network traffic and time-series data. Prompt detection of these irregularities is crucial for ensuring service quality, preventing financial losses, and maintaining robust security standards. While machine learning algorithms have shown promise in achieving high accuracy for anomaly detection, their performance is often constrained by the specific conditions of their training data. A persistent challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled data for anomaly detection in time-series datasets. This limitation hampers the training efficacy of both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models. To address this, unsupervised transfer learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging unlabeled data from a source domain to identify anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, many existing approaches still depend on a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. To overcome these constraints, we propose a transfer learning-based model for anomaly detection in multivariate time-series datasets. Unlike conventional methods, our approach does not require labeled data in either the source or target domains. Empirical evaluations on novel intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing techniques in accurately identifying anomalies within an entirely unlabeled target domain.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Stochastic Volatility under Informative Missingness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15297v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic volatility models that treat the variance of a time series as a stochastic process have proven to be important tools for analyzing dynamic variability. Current methods for fitting and conducting inference on stochastic volatility models are limited by the assumption that any missing data are missing at random. With a recent explosion in technology to facilitate the collection of dynamic self-response data for which mechanisms underlying missing data are inherently scientifically informative, this limitation in statistical methodology also limits scientific advancement. The goal of this article is to develop the first statistical methodology for modeling, fitting, and conducting inference on stochastic volatility with data that are missing not at random. The approach is based upon a novel imputation method derived using Tukey's representation, which utilizes the Markovian nature of stochastic volatility models to overcome unidentifiable components often faced when modeling informative missingness in other settings. This imputation method is combined with a new conditional particle filtering with ancestor sampling procedure that accounts for variability in imputation to formulate a complete particle Gibbs sampling scheme. The use of the method is illustrated through the analysis of mobile phone self-reported mood from individuals being monitored after unsuccessful suicide attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 to...</summary><p>41 total pages, 1 cover page, 27 pages main text, 4 pages references, 9 pages appendices, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages. Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed. Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models face challenges in identifying critical components for prediction, leading to limited interpretability and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose the Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting. Ister decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, further modeling multi-periodicity and inter-series dependencies using a Dual Transformer architecture. We introduce a novel Dot-attention mechanism that improves interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ister outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 10% improvement in MSE. Moreover, Ister enables intuitive visualization of component contributions, shedding lights on model's decision process and enhancing transparency in prediction results.</p></details> |  |

To estimate the number of factors in this two-way factor model, we decompose the series into two parts: one being a non-weakly correlated series and the other being a weakly correlated noise. By comparing the difference between two series, we can construct white-noise based signal statistics to determine the number of factors in row loading matrix (column loading matrix). Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact on the accuracy of the estimation, which is caused by the interaction between the row loading matrix and the column loading matrix, we propose a transformation so that the transformed model only contains the row loading matrix (column loading matrix). We define sequences of ratios of two test statistics as signal statistics to determine the number of factors and derive the consistence of the estimation. We implement the numerical studies to examine the performance of the new methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field.

Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain, many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Mixture of Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics 2025</p></details> |

Shapley values are widely used to evaluate the contribution of different time-steps and features in a test sample, and are commonly generated through repeatedly inferring on each sample with different parts of information removed. Therefore, it requires expensive inference-time computations that occur at every request for model explanations. In contrast, our framework unifies the explanation and prediction in training through a novel Shapley-based pre-training design, which eliminates the undesirable test-time computation and replaces it with a single-time pre-training. Moreover, this specialized pre-training benefits the prediction performance by making the transformer model more effectively weigh different features and time-steps in the time-series, particularly improving the robustness against data noise that is common to raw time-series data. We experimentally validated our approach on eight public datasets, where our time-series model achieved competitive results in both classification and regression tasks, while providing Shapley-based explanations similar to those obtained with post-hoc computation. Our work offers an efficient and explainable solution for time-series analysis tasks in the safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted to 21st IEEE CSPA 2025</p></details> |

Smart homes is one such domain where bulk of data is being generated and anomaly detection is one of the many challenges addressed by researchers in recent years. Contextual anomaly is a kind of anomaly that may show deviation from the normal pattern like point or sequence anomalies, but it also requires prior knowledge about the data domain and the actions that caused the deviation. Recent studies based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have demonstrated strong performance in anomaly detection. This study explores the impact of automatically tuned hyperparamteres on Unsupervised Online Contextual Anomaly Detection (UoCAD) approach by proposing UoCAD with Optimised Hyperparamnters (UoCAD-OH). UoCAD-OH conducts hyperparameter optimisation on Bi-LSTM model in an offline phase and uses the fine-tuned hyperparameters to detect anomalies during the online phase. The experiments involve evaluating the proposed framework on two smart home air quality datasets containing contextual anomalies. The evaluation metrics used are Precision, Recall, and F1 score.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

While contrastive learning has gained momentum in the time series domain for its prowess in extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, its straightforward application to anomaly detection is not without hurdles. Firstly, contrastive learning typically requires negative sampling to avoid the representation collapse issue, where the encoder converges to a constant solution. However, drawing from the same dataset for dissimilar samples is ill-suited for TSAD as most samples are ``normal'' in the training dataset. Secondly, conventional contrastive learning focuses on instance discrimination, which may overlook anomalies that are detectable when compared to their temporal context. In this study, we propose a novel approach, CNT, that incorporates a window-based contrastive learning strategy fortified with learnable transformations. This dual configuration focuses on capturing temporal anomalies in local regions while simultaneously mitigating the representation collapse issue. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of CNT in circumventing constant encoder solutions. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world industrial datasets, we show the superiority of our framework by outperforming various baselines and model variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates.

While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first-cut multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data.

While most time series databases and systems rely on lossless compression, lossy techniques offer even greater space-saving with a small loss in precision. However, the unknown impact on downstream analytics applications requires a semi-manual trial-and-error exploration. We initiate work on lossy compression that provides guarantees on complex statistical features (which are strongly correlated with the accuracy of the downstream analytics). Specifically, we propose a new lossy compression method that provides guarantees on the autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF) of a time series. Our method leverages line simplification techniques as well as incremental maintenance of aggregates, blocking, and parallelization strategies for effective and efficient compression. The results show that our method improves compression ratios by 2x on average and up to 54x on selected datasets, compared to previous lossy and lossless compression methods. Moreover, we maintain -- and sometimes even improve -- the forecasting accuracy by preserving the autocorrelation properties of the time series. Our framework is extensible to multivariate time series and other statistical features of the time series.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look Into the LITE in Deep Learning for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02869v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have been shown to be a powerful solution for Time Series Classification (TSC). State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 2 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reconstructing ecological community dynamics from limited observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03820v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ecosystems tend to fluctuate around stable equilibria in response to internal dynamics and environmental factors. Occasionally, they enter an unstable tipping region and collapse into an alternative stable state. Our understanding of how ecological communities vary over time and respond to perturbations depends on our ability to quantify and predict these dynamics. However, the scarcity of long, dense time series data poses a severe bottleneck for characterising community dynamics using existing methods. We overcome this limitation by combining information across multiple short time series using Bayesian inference. By decomposing dynamics into deterministic and stochastic components using Gaussian process priors, we predict stable and tipping regions along the community landscape and quantify resilience while addressing uncertainty. After validation with simulated and real ecological time series, we use the model to question common assumptions underlying classical potential analysis and re-evaluate the stability of previously proposed "tipping elements" in the human gut microbiota.</p></details> |  |

However, theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signals. In this contribution, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm and show that, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCAD: Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series from the Perspective of Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13493v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications and is being extensively studied. Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[FreEformer: Frequency Enhanced Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13989v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents \textbf{FreEformer}, a simple yet effective model that leverages a \textbf{Fre}quency \textbf{E}nhanced Trans\textbf{former} for multivariate time series forecasting. Our work is based on the assumption that the frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of series across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust representation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the complex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Transformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture cross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed independently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a low-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be attributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the strong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this, we enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional learnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1 normalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention mechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity, traffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention mechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art Transformer-based forecasters.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it stands to benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, certain critical architectural decisions have not received systematic exploration. In this study, we meticulously investigate these design choices within the broad category of encoder-predictor architectures. We identify robust architectures applicable to both time series and spectrogram input representations. These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine, code available at https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/s4sleep</p></details> |

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Embedding Methods for Classification Tasks: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13392v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis has become crucial in various fields, from engineering and finance to healthcare and social sciences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and evaluation of time series embedding methods for effective representations in machine learning and deep learning models. We introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their theoretical foundations and application contexts. Unlike previous surveys, our work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific applications, including engineering systems. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we provide an open-source code repository implementing these embedding methods. This study contributes to the field by offering a systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications, and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dynamic Triple Gamma Prior as a Shrinkage Process Prior for Time-Varying Parameter Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10487v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing shrinkage approaches for time-varying parameter (TVP) models assume constant innovation variances across time points, inducing sparsity by shrinking these variances toward zero. However, this assumption falls short when states exhibit large jumps or structural changes, as often seen in empirical time series analysis. To address this, we propose the dynamic triple gamma prior -- a stochastic process that induces time-dependent shrinkage by modeling dependence among innovations while retaining a well-known triple gamma marginal distribution. This framework encompasses various special and limiting cases, including the horseshoe shrinkage prior, making it highly flexible. We derive key properties of the dynamic triple gamma that highlight its dynamic shrinkage behavior and develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling. The proposed approach is evaluated through sparse covariance modeling and forecasting of the returns of the EURO STOXX 50 index, demonstrating favorable forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines two trend estimation methods: the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter and the l1 filter. A major challenge in these methods is selecting the tuning parameter lambda, which we address by introducing two selection techniques. For the HP based change point detection, we propose a probability-based threshold to select lambda under the assumption of an exponential distribution. For the l1 based method, we suggest a selection strategy assuming normality. Additionally, we introduce a technique to estimate the maximum number of change points in time segments using the l1 based method. We validate our methods by comparing them to similar techniques, such as PELT, using simulated data. We also demonstrate the practical application of our approach to real-world SNP stock data, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting change points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Multi-Modal Subcomponent-Level Measurements for Trustworthy System Monitoring and Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13081v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasingly sophisticated cyber-adversaries able to access a wider repertoire of mechanisms to implant malware such as ransomware, CPU/GPU keyloggers, and stealthy kernel rootkits, there is an urgent need for techniques to detect and mitigate such attacks. While state of the art relies on digital and analog side channel measurements assuming trustworthiness of measurements obtained on the main processor, such an approach has limitations since processor-based side channel measurements are potentially untrustworthy. Sophisticated adversaries (especially in late stage cyber attacks when they have breached the computer and network security systems such as firewalls and antivirus and penetrated the computer's OS) can compromise user-space and kernel-space measurements. To address this key limitation of state of the art, we propose a "subcomponent-level" approach to collect side channel measurements so as to enable robust anomaly detection in a modern computer even when the main processor is compromised. Our proposed approach leverages the fact that modern computers are complex systems with multiple interacting subcomponents and measurements from subcomponents can be used to detect anomalies even when the main processor is no longer trustworthy. We develop mechanisms to obtain time series measurements of activity of several subcomponents and methodologies to process and fuse these measurements for anomaly detection. The subcomponents include network interface controller, GPU, CPU Hardware Performance Counters, CPU power, and keyboard. Our main hypothesis is that subcomponent measurements can enable detection of security threats without requiring a trustworthy main processor. By enabling real-time measurements from multiple subcomponents, the goal is to provide a deeper visibility into system operation, thereby yielding a powerful tool to track system operation and detect anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 29 figures |

The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

| **[TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13041v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current time series forecasting methods can be broadly classified into two categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies, both aiming to capture the complex dependencies within time series data. However, the CI strategy fails to exploit highly correlated covariate information, while the CD strategy integrates all dependencies, including irrelevant or noisy ones, thus compromising generalization. To mitigate these issues, recent works have introduced the Channel Clustering (CC) strategy by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying different modeling techniques to each cluster. However, coarse-grained clustering cannot flexibly capture complex, time-varying interactions. Addressing the above challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a graph-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. Specifically, after constructing the graph with the input sequence, TimeFilter filters out irrelevant correlations and preserves the most critical ones through patch-specific filtering. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeFilter.</p></details> |  |

So far, causal research has been focused mostly on the i.i.d. setting. However, many are the situations where there exists a non-trivial dependence structure between sequential observations. Motivated by this fact, the main purpose of this work is to study causal properties of time series under the structural assumption of a VARMA model with instantaneous effects. First, the global Markov property is studied, building on existing work for VAR processes without instantaneous effects. Infinite graphs which represent the dependencies of the process are defined so that separation statements translate to conditional independencies in the stationary distribution of the process. Second, faithfulness is examined as a counterpart of this Markov property. Conditions are given so that the stationary distribution of the process is almost surely faithful to said infinite graphs. In addition, an instrumental variable regression framework is developed for VARMA models with instantaneous effects. This allows to identify and consistently estimate total causal effects.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 figures |

Punctuation marks at the end of sentences are of particular importance as their distribution can determine various complexity features of written natural language. Here, the sentence length variability (SLV) time series representing "Hopscotch" by Julio Cortazar are subjected to quantitative analysis with an attempt to identify their distribution type, long-memory effects, and potential multiscale patterns. The analyzed novel is an important and innovative piece of literature whose essential property is freedom of movement between its building blocks given to a reader by the author. The statistical consequences of this freedom are closely investigated in both the original, Spanish version of the novel, and its translations into English and Polish. Clear evidence of rich multifractality in the SLV dynamics, with a left-sided asymmetry, however, is observed in all three language versions as well as in the versions with differently ordered chapters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget-constrained Collaborative Renewable Energy Forecasting Market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12367v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate power forecasting from renewable energy sources (RES) is crucial for integrating additional RES capacity into the power system and realizing sustainability goals. This work emphasizes the importance of integrating decentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However, decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success of such spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharing need to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis of the forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSO regression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics market to ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers and sellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporating price constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation. Results show significant accuracy improvements and potential monetary gains for data sellers. For wind power data, an average root mean squared error improvement of over 10% was achieved by comparing forecasts generated by the proposal with locally generated ones.</p></details> |  |

The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of future predictions of tumor masks and multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MRI) of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our approach is based on cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We included sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning inputs to guide the generative diffusion process as well as a joint segmentation process. This allows for tumor growth estimates and realistic MRI generation at any given treatment and time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model demonstrates promising performance across various tasks, including generating high-quality multi-parametric MRI with tumor masks, performing time-series tumor segmentations, and providing uncertainty estimates. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRI, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprints in IEEE-TMI, 14 pages</p></details> |

With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</p></details> |  |

However, implementing such models in the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes presents hurdles due to computational constraints and intricacies. In this work, for the first time, we propose a near-sensor neuro-symbolic AI computing accelerator named Neuro-Photonix for vision applications. Neuro-photonix processes neural dynamic computations on analog data while inherently supporting granularity-controllable convolution operations through the efficient use of photonic devices. Additionally, the creation of an innovative, low-cost ADC that works seamlessly with photonic technology removes the necessity for costly ADCs. Moreover, Neuro-Photonix facilitates the generation of HyperDimensional (HD) vectors for HD-based symbolic AI computing. This approach allows the proposed design to substantially diminish the energy consumption and latency of conversion, transmission, and processing within the established cloud-centric architecture and recently designed accelerators. Our device-to-architecture results show that Neuro-Photonix achieves 30 GOPS/W and reduces power consumption by a factor of 20.8 and 4.1 on average on neural dynamics compared to ASIC baselines and photonic accelerators while preserving accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Semantic Framework for Neuro-Symbolic Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12050v5)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of neuro-symbolic AI aims to benefit from the combination of neural networks and symbolic systems. A cornerstone of the field is the translation or encoding of symbolic knowledge into neural networks. Although many neuro-symbolic methods and approaches have been proposed, and with a large increase in recent years, no common definition of encoding exists that can enable a precise, theoretical comparison of neuro-symbolic methods. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a semantic framework for neuro-symbolic AI. We start by providing a formal definition of semantic encoding, specifying the components and conditions under which a knowledge-base can be encoded correctly by a neural network. We then show that many neuro-symbolic approaches are accounted for by this definition. We provide a number of examples and correspondence proofs applying the proposed framework to the neural encoding of various forms of knowledge representation. Many, at first sight disparate, neuro-symbolic methods, are shown to fall within the proposed formalization. This is expected to provide guidance to future neuro-symbolic encodings by placing them in the broader context of semantic encodings of entire families of existing neuro-symbolic systems. The paper hopes to help initiate a discussion around the provision of a theory for neuro-symbolic AI and a semantics for deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Generalisation Between Humans and Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15626v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI -- including generative approaches -- have resulted in technology that can support humans in scientific discovery and decision support but may also disrupt democracies and target individuals. The responsible use of AI increasingly shows the need for human-AI teaming, necessitating effective interaction between humans and machines. A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of these interactions is the different ways in which humans and machines generalise. In cognitive science, human generalisation commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. In contrast, AI generalisation encompasses out-of-domain generalisation in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neuro-symbolic AI. In this perspective paper, we combine insights from AI and cognitive science to identify key commonalities and differences across three dimensions: notions of generalisation, methods for generalisation, and evaluation of generalisation. We map the different conceptualisations of generalisation in AI and cognitive science along these three dimensions and consider their role in human-AI teaming. This results in interdisciplinary challenges across AI and cognitive science that must be tackled to provide a foundation for effective and cognitively supported alignment in human-AI teaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks, were not designed to capture more than a few of these aspects. Whereas deep learning datasets focus on visually complex data but simple visual reasoning tasks, inductive logic datasets involve complex logical learning tasks, however, lack the visual component. To address this, we propose the diagnostic visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Train, - a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL-Train provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even SOTA AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations of each methodology. Overall, V-LoL opens up new avenues for understanding and enhancing current abilities in visual logical learning for AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap: Representation Spaces in Neuro-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04393v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic AI is an effective method for improving the overall performance of AI models by combining the advantages of neural networks and symbolic learning. However, there are differences between the two in terms of how they process data, primarily because they often use different data representation methods, which is often an important factor limiting the overall performance of the two. From this perspective, we analyzed 191 studies from 2013 by constructing a four-level classification framework. The first level defines five types of representation spaces, and the second level focuses on five types of information modalities that the representation space can represent. Then, the third level describes four symbolic logic methods. Finally, the fourth-level categories propose three collaboration strategies between neural networks and symbolic learning. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of 46 research based on their representation space.</p></details> |  |

Although neuro-symbolic AI hopes to enhance the overall explainability by leveraging the transparency of symbolic learning, the results are less evident than imagined. This article proposes a classification for explainability by considering both model design and behavior of 191 studies from 2013, focusing on neuro-symbolic AI, hoping to inspire scholars who want to understand the explainability of neuro-symbolic AI. Precisely, we classify them into five categories by considering whether the form of bridging the representation differences is readable as their design factor, if there are representation differences between neural networks and symbolic logic learning, and whether a model decision or prediction process is understandable as their behavior factor: implicit intermediate representations and implicit prediction, partially explicit intermediate representations and partially explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representations or explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representation and explicit prediction, unified representation and explicit prediction. We also analyzed the research trends and three significant challenges: unified representations, explainability and transparency, and sufficient cooperation from neural networks and symbolic learning. Finally, we put forward suggestions for future research in three aspects: unified representations, enhancing model explainability, ethical considerations, and social impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00773v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI. All the code and data are open-sourced at our website.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

The motivation is that the strengths of either area match the weaknesses of the other, and $\unicode{x2013}$ by combining the two $\unicode{x2013}$ the weaknesses of either method can be limited. Neuro-symbolic AI focuses on this integration where the statistical methods are in particular neural networks. In recent years, there has been significant progress in this research field, where neuro-symbolic systems outperformed logical or neural models alone. Yet, neuro-symbolic AI is, comparatively speaking, still in its infancy and has not been widely adopted by machine learning practitioners. In this survey, we present the first mapping of neuro-symbolic techniques into families of frameworks based on their architectures, with several benefits: Firstly, it allows us to link different strengths of frameworks to their respective architectures. Secondly, it allows us to illustrate how engineers can augment their neural networks while treating the symbolic methods as black-boxes. Thirdly, it allows us to map most of the field so that future researchers can identify closely related frameworks.</p></details> | 57 pages |

The growing need to produce and maintain increasingly complex multi-architecture applications makes it crucial to effectively accelerate and automate software engineering processes. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are expected to work hand-in-hand with human developers. Therefore, it becomes critical to model the software accurately, so that the AI and humans can share a common understanding of the problem. In this contribution, firstly, an in-depth overview of these interconnected challenges faced by modern software engineering is presented. Secondly, to tackle them, a novel architecture based on the emerging WebAssembly technology and the latest advancements in neuro-symbolic AI, autonomy, and knowledge graphs is proposed. The presented system architecture is based on the concept of dynamic, knowledge graph-based WebAssembly Twins, which model the software throughout all stages of its lifecycle. The resulting systems are to possess advanced autonomous capabilities, with full transparency and controllability by the end user. The concept takes a leap beyond the current software engineering approaches, addressing some of the most urgent issues in the field.

Comprising a 'neuro' component for feature extraction and a 'symbolic' component for decision-making, neuro-symbolic AI has yet to fully benefit from efficient hardware accelerators. Additionally, current hardware struggles to accommodate applications requiring dynamic resource allocation between these two components. To address these challenges-and mitigate the typical data-transfer bottleneck of classical Von Neumann architectures-we propose a ferroelectric charge-domain compute-in-memory (CiM) array as the foundational processing element for neuro-symbolic AI. This array seamlessly handles both the critical multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations of the 'neuro' workload and the parallel associative search operations of the 'symbolic' workload. To enable this approach, we introduce an innovative 1FeFET-1C cell, combining a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with a capacitor. This design, overcomes the destructive sensing limitations of DRAM in CiM applications, while capable of capitalizing decades of DRAM expertise with a similar cell structure as DRAM, achieves high immunity against FeFET variation-crucial for neuro-symbolic AI-and demonstrates superior energy efficiency. The functionalities of our design have been successfully validated through SPICE simulations and prototype fabrication and testing. Our hardware platform has been benchmarked in executing typical neuro-symbolic AI reasoning tasks, showing over 2x improvement in latency and 1000x improvement in energy efficiency compared to GPU-based implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Explanations for Neuro-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14219v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the practical success of Artificial Intelligence (AI), current neural AI algorithms face two significant issues. First, the decisions made by neural architectures are often prone to bias and brittleness. Second, when a chain of reasoning is required, neural systems often perform poorly. Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is a promising approach that tackles these (and other) weaknesses by combining the power of neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Meanwhile, the success of AI has made it critical to understand its behaviour, leading to the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While neuro-symbolic AI systems have important advantages over purely neural AI, we still need to explain their actions, which are obscured by the interactions of the neural and symbolic components. To address the issue, this paper proposes a formal approach to explaining the decisions of neuro-symbolic systems. The approach hinges on the use of formal abductive explanations and on solving the neuro-symbolic explainability problem hierarchically. Namely, it first computes a formal explanation for the symbolic component of the system, which serves to identify a subset of the individual parts of neural information that needs to be explained. This is followed by explaining only those individual neural inputs, independently of each other, which facilitates succinctness of hierarchical formal explanations and helps to increase the overall performance of the approach. Experimental results for a few complex reasoning tasks demonstrate practical efficiency of the proposed approach, in comparison to purely neural systems, from the perspective of explanation size, explanation time, training time, model sizes, and the quality of explanations reported.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI focuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation, LAAs integrate neuro-symbolic AI principles, showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human-like reasoning processes, scaling effectively with large datasets, and leveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training. The research underscores promising avenues in neuro-vector-symbolic integration, instructional encoding, and implicit reasoning, aimed at further enhancing LAA capabilities.

To develop next-generation cognitive AI systems, neuro-symbolic AI emerges as a promising paradigm, fusing neural and symbolic approaches to enhance interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness, while facilitating learning from much less data. Recent neuro-symbolic systems have demonstrated great potential in collaborative human-AI scenarios with reasoning and cognitive capabilities. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics and potential architectures for neuro-symbolic AI. We first systematically categorize neuro-symbolic AI algorithms, and then experimentally evaluate and analyze them in terms of runtime, memory, computational operators, sparsity, and system characteristics on CPUs, GPUs, and edge SoCs. Our studies reveal that neuro-symbolic models suffer from inefficiencies on off-the-shelf hardware, due to the memory-bound nature of vector-symbolic and logical operations, complex flow control, data dependencies, sparsity variations, and limited scalability. Based on profiling insights, we suggest cross-layer optimization solutions and present a hardware acceleration case study for vector-symbolic architecture to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of neuro-symbolic computing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions of neuro-symbolic AI from both system and architectural perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables; IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Artificial Intelligence (TCASAI), 2024</p></details> |

However, high-stakes decision-making tasks in fields such as medical, legal and finance require a level of precision, comprehensiveness, and logical consistency that pure LLM or Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) approaches often fail to deliver. At Elemental Cognition (EC), we have developed a neuro-symbolic AI platform to tackle these problems. The platform integrates fine-tuned LLMs for knowledge extraction and alignment with a robust symbolic reasoning engine for logical inference, planning and interactive constraint solving. We describe Cora, a Collaborative Research Assistant built on this platform, that is designed to perform complex research and discovery tasks in high-stakes domains. This paper discusses the multi-step inference challenges inherent in such domains, critiques the limitations of existing LLM-based methods, and demonstrates how Cora's neuro-symbolic approach effectively addresses these issues. We provide an overview of the system architecture, key algorithms for knowledge extraction and formal reasoning, and present preliminary evaluation results that highlight Cora's superior performance compared to well-known LLM and RAG baselines.</p></details> |  |

An elegant approach to represent this intricate factorization is via high-dimensional holographic vectors drawing on brain-inspired vector symbolic architectures.

However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise. An extensive evaluation carried out on two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.</p></details> |  |

This requires combining heterogeneous data sources such as knowledge graphs, neural model predictions, structured databases, crowd-sourced data, and many more. To allow for such reasoning, we generalise the standard rule-based language Datalog with existential rules (commonly referred to as tuple-generating dependencies) to the fuzzy setting, by allowing for arbitrary t-norms in the place of classical conjunctions in rule bodies. The resulting formalism allows us to perform reasoning about data associated with degrees of uncertainty while preserving computational complexity results and the applicability of reasoning techniques established for the standard Datalog setting. In particular, we provide fuzzy extensions of Datalog chases which produce fuzzy universal models and we exploit them to show that in important fragments of the language, reasoning has the same complexity as in the classical setting.</p></details> |  |

However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems.</p></details> |  |

The challenge is how to effectively integrate neural and symbolic computation, to enable learning and reasoning from raw data. Existing pipelines that train the neural and symbolic components sequentially require extensive labelling, whereas end-to-end approaches are limited in terms of scalability, due to the combinatorial explosion in the symbol grounding problem. In this paper, we leverage the implicit knowledge within foundation models to enhance the performance in NeSy tasks, whilst reducing the amount of data labelling and manual engineering. We introduce a new architecture, called NeSyGPT, which fine-tunes a vision-language foundation model to extract symbolic features from raw data, before learning a highly expressive answer set program to solve a downstream task. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that NeSyGPT has superior accuracy over various baselines, and can scale to complex NeSy tasks. Finally, we highlight the effective use of a large language model to generate the programmatic interface between the neural and symbolic components, significantly reducing the amount of manual engineering required.</p></details> | Pre-print |

A promising direction for achieving this goal is Neuro-Symbolic AI, which aims to combine the interpretability of symbolic techniques with the ability of deep learning to learn from raw data. However, most current approaches require manually engineered symbolic knowledge, and where end-to-end training is considered, such approaches are either restricted to learning definite programs, or are restricted to training binary neural networks. In this paper, we introduce Neuro-Symbolic Inductive Learner (NSIL), an approach that trains a general neural network to extract latent concepts from raw data, whilst learning symbolic knowledge that maps latent concepts to target labels. The novelty of our approach is a method for biasing the learning of symbolic knowledge, based on the in-training performance of both neural and symbolic components. We evaluate NSIL on three problem domains of different complexity, including an NP-complete problem.

This often requires maximizing the likelihood of a symbolic constraint w.r.t the neural network's output distribution. Such output distributions are typically assumed to be fully-factorized. This limits the applicability of neuro-symbolic learning to the more expressive autoregressive distributions, e.g., transformers. Under such distributions, computing the likelihood of even simple constraints is #P-hard. Instead of attempting to enforce the constraint on the entire output distribution, we propose to do so on a random, local approximation thereof. More precisely, we optimize the likelihood of the constraint under a pseudolikelihood-based approximation centered around a model sample. Our approximation is factorized, allowing the reuse of solutions to sub-problems, a main tenet for efficiently computing neuro-symbolic losses. Moreover, it is a local, high-fidelity approximation of the likelihood, exhibiting low entropy and KL-divergence around the model sample. We evaluate our approach on Sudoku and shortest-path prediction cast as autoregressive generation, and observe that we greatly improve upon the base model's ability to predict logically-consistent outputs. We also evaluate on the task of detoxifying large language models. Using a simple constraint disallowing a list of toxic words, we are able to steer the model's outputs away from toxic generations, achieving SoTA detoxification compared to previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated detoxification experiments; moved example toxic generations to Github and added link</p></details> |

The integration of KGs with neuronal learning (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) is currently a topic of active research, commonly named neuro-symbolic AI. Despite the numerous benefits that can be accomplished with KG-based AI, its growing ubiquity within online services may result in the loss of self-determination for citizens as a fundamental societal issue. The more we rely on these technologies, which are often centralised, the less citizens will be able to determine their own destinies. To counter this threat, AI regulation, such as the European Union (EU) AI Act, is being proposed in certain regions. The regulation sets what technologists need to do, leading to questions concerning: How can the output of AI systems be trusted? What is needed to ensure that the data fuelling and the inner workings of these artefacts are transparent? How can AI be made accountable for its decision-making? This paper conceptualises the foundational topics and research pillars to support KG-based AI for self-determination. Drawing upon this conceptual framework, challenges and opportunities for citizen self-determination are illustrated and analysed in a real-world scenario. As a result, we propose a research agenda aimed at accomplishing the recommended objectives.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we delve into the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dealing with progressively complex analogies expressed in unstructured text. We discuss analogies at four distinct levels of complexity: lexical analogies, syntactic analogies, semantic analogies, and pragmatic analogies. As the analogies become more complex, they require increasingly extensive, diverse knowledge beyond the textual content, unlikely to be found in the lexical co-occurrence statistics that power LLMs. To address this, we discuss the necessity of employing Neuro-symbolic AI techniques that combine statistical and symbolic AI, informing the representation of unstructured text to highlight and augment relevant content, provide abstraction and guide the mapping process. Our knowledge-informed approach maintains the efficiency of LLMs while preserving the ability to explain analogies for pedagogical applications.</p></details> | 12 pages 3 figures |

In this paper we consider the intensional First Order Logic (IFOL) as a symbolic architecture of modern robots, able to use natural languages to communicate with humans and to reason about their own knowledge with self-reference and abstraction language property. We intend to obtain the grounding of robot's language by experience of how it uses its neuronal architectures and hence by associating this experience with the mining (sense) of non-defined language concepts (particulars/individuals and universals) in PRP (Properties/Relations/Propositions) theory of IFOL.\\ We consider the robot's four-levels knowledge structure: The syntax level of particular natural language (Italian, French, etc..), two universal language levels: its semantic logic structure (based on virtual predicates of FOL and logic connectives), and its corresponding conceptual PRP structure level which universally represents the composite mining of FOL formulae grounded on the last robot's neuro-system level. Finally, we provide the general method how to implement in IFOL (by using the abstracted terms) different kinds of modal logic operators and their deductive axioms: we present a particular example of robots autoepistemic deduction capabilities by introduction of the special temporal $Konow$ predicate and deductive axioms for it: reflexive, positive introspection and distributive axiom.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |

Metadata provides a brief overview of the paper while the Full-body text contains key-insights that can be valuable to fellow researchers. To retrieve metadata and key-insights from scientific papers, knowledge acquisition is a central activity. It consists of gathering, analyzing and organizing knowledge embedded in scientific papers in such a way that it can be used and reused whenever needed. Given the wealth of scientific literature, manual knowledge acquisition is a cumbersome task. Thus, computer-assisted and (semi-)automatic strategies are generally adopted. Our purpose in this research was two fold: curate Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) with papers related to ontology learning and define an approach using ORKG as a computer-assisted tool to organize key-insights extracted from research papers. This approach was used to document the "epidemiological surveillance systems design and implementation" research problem and to prepare the related work of this paper. It is currently used to document "food information engineering", "Tabular data to Knowledge Graph Matching" and "Question Answering" research problems and "Neuro-symbolic AI" domain.</p></details> |  |

This approach addresses a key criticism of current generation systems, namely their inability to generate human-understandable explanations for their outcomes and ensure safe behaviors, especially in scenarios with \textit{unknown unknowns} (e.g. cybersecurity, privacy). The integration of neural networks, which excel at exploring complex data spaces, and symbolic knowledge graphs, which represent domain knowledge, allows AI systems to reason, learn, and generalize in a manner understandable to experts. This article describes how applications in cybersecurity and privacy, two most demanding domains in terms of the need for AI to be explainable while being highly accurate in complex environments, can benefit from Neuro-Symbolic AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure (To Appear in IEEE Internet Computing)</p></details> |

We find that a straight-through-estimator, a method introduced to train binary neural networks, could effectively be applied to incorporate logical constraints into neural network learning. More specifically, we design a systematic way to represent discrete logical constraints as a loss function; minimizing this loss using gradient descent via a straight-through-estimator updates the neural network's weights in the direction that the binarized outputs satisfy the logical constraints. The experimental results show that by leveraging GPUs and batch training, this method scales significantly better than existing neuro-symbolic methods that require heavy symbolic computation for computing gradients. Also, we demonstrate that our method applies to different types of neural networks, such as MLP, CNN, and GNN, making them learn with no or fewer labeled data by learning directly from known constraints.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Though results have been impressive, explainability and interpretability of deep learning models are still a challenge. A third wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which includes logic and reasoning, has been described as a way to address these issues. Neuro-symbolic AI is a key component of this integration of logic and reasoning with deep learning. In this work we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called Neuro-Symbolic Question-Answer Program Translator, or NS-QAPT, to address explainability and interpretability for deep learning climate simulation, applied to climate tipping point discovery. The NS-QAPT method includes a bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture that translates between domain-specific questions and executable programs used to direct the climate simulation, acting as a bridge between climate scientists and deep learning models. We show early compelling results of this translation method and introduce a domain-specific language and associated executable programs for a commonly known tipping point, the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).</p></details> |  |

It consists in automatically learning a logical theory from data. The basis for structure learning is mining repeating patterns in the data, known as structural motifs. Finding these patterns reduces the exponential search space and therefore guides the learning of formulas. Despite the importance of motif learning, it is still not well understood. We present the first principled approach for mining structural motifs in lifted graphical models, languages that blend first-order logic with probabilistic models, which uses a stochastic process to measure the similarity of entities in the data. Our first contribution is an algorithm, which depends on two intuitive hyperparameters: one controlling the uncertainty in the entity similarity measure, and one controlling the softness of the resulting rules. Our second contribution is a preprocessing step where we perform hierarchical clustering on the data to reduce the search space to the most relevant data. Our third contribution is to introduce an O(n ln n) (in the size of the entities in the data) algorithm for clustering structurally-related data. We evaluate our approach using standard benchmarks and show that we outperform state-of-the-art structure learning approaches by up to 6% in terms of accuracy and up to 80% in terms of runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI23. 9 pages.

Deep Probabilistic Programming Languages (DPPLs) have been developed for probabilistic logic programming to be carried out via the probability estimations of deep neural networks. However, recent SOTA DPPL approaches allow only for limited conditional probabilistic queries and do not offer the power of true joint probability estimation. In our work, we propose an easy integration of tractable probabilistic inference within a DPPL. To this end, we introduce SLASH, a novel DPPL that consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and a logic program, united via answer set programming (ASP). NPPs are a novel design principle allowing for combining all deep model types and combinations thereof to be represented as a single probabilistic predicate. In this context, we introduce a novel $+/-$ notation for answering various types of probabilistic queries by adjusting the atom notations of a predicate. To scale well, we show how to prune the stochastically insignificant parts of the (ground) program, speeding up reasoning without sacrificing the predictive performance. We evaluate SLASH on a variety of different tasks, including the benchmark task of MNIST addition and Visual Question Answering (VQA).</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |

Our motivation is three fold. First, for machine learning researchers unaware of why the research community cares about relational representations, this article can serve as a gentle introduction. Second, for logical experts who are newcomers to the learning area, such an article can help in navigating the differences between finite vs infinite, and subjective probabilities vs random-world semantics. Finally, for researchers from statistical relational learning and neuro-symbolic AI, who are usually embedded in finite worlds with subjective probabilities, appreciating what infinite domains and random-world semantics brings to the table is of utmost theoretical import.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Approaches for Context-Aware Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05058v1)** | 2023-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning models are a standard solution for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), but their deployment is often limited by labeled data scarcity and models' opacity. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate these issues by infusing knowledge about context information into HAR deep learning classifiers. However, existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR require computationally expensive symbolic reasoners during classification, making them less suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile devices). Additionally, NeSy approaches for context-aware HAR have never been evaluated on in-the-wild datasets, and their generalization capabilities in real-world scenarios are questionable. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on a semantic loss function that infuses knowledge constraints in the HAR model during the training phase, avoiding symbolic reasoning during classification. Our results on scripted and in-the-wild datasets show the impact of different semantic loss functions in outperforming a purely data-driven model. We also compare our solution with existing NeSy methods and analyze each approach's strengths and weaknesses. Our semantic loss remains the only NeSy solution that can be deployed as a single DNN without the need for symbolic reasoning modules, reaching recognition rates close (and better in some cases) to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.</p></details> | ACL 2023 |

In recent years, they have also gained popularity in neuro-symbolic AI, serving as a benchmark to evaluate general problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. The open-ended and conceptual nature of these visual programming tasks make them challenging, both for state-of-the-art AI agents as well as for novice programmers. A natural approach to providing assistance for problem-solving is breaking down a complex task into a progression of simpler subtasks; however, this is not trivial given that the solution codes are typically nested and have non-linear execution behavior. In this paper, we formalize the problem of synthesizing such a progression for a given reference block-based visual programming task. We propose a novel synthesis algorithm that generates a progression of subtasks that are high-quality, well-spaced in terms of their complexity, and solving this progression leads to solving the reference task. We show the utility of our synthesis algorithm in improving the efficacy of AI agents (in this case, neural program synthesizers) for solving tasks in the Karel programming environment. Then, we conduct a user study to demonstrate that our synthesized progression of subtasks can assist a novice programmer in solving tasks in the Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code-dot-org.</p></details> |  |

In particular, assessing the compliance of a product with the relative schematic is a time-consuming and prone-to-error process. In this paper, we address this problem in a specific industrial scenario. In particular, we define a Neuro-Symbolic approach for automating the compliance verification of the electrical control panels. Our approach is based on the combination of Deep Learning techniques with Answer Set Programming (ASP), and allows for identifying possible anomalies and errors in the final product even when a very limited amount of training data is available. The experiments conducted on a real test case provided by an Italian Company operating in electrical control panel production demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming journal</p></details> |

This is mainly because neural networks are not able to decompose joint representations to obtain distinct objects (the so-called binding problem), while symbolic AI suffers from exhaustive rule searches, among other problems. These two problems are still pronounced in neuro-symbolic AI which aims to combine the best of the two paradigms. Here, we show that the two problems can be addressed with our proposed neuro-vector-symbolic architecture (NVSA) by exploiting its powerful operators on high-dimensional distributed representations that serve as a common language between neural networks and symbolic AI. The efficacy of NVSA is demonstrated by solving the Raven's progressive matrices datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art deep neural network and neuro-symbolic approaches, end-to-end training of NVSA achieves a new record of 87.7% average accuracy in RAVEN, and 88.1% in I-RAVEN datasets. Moreover, compared to the symbolic reasoning within the neuro-symbolic approaches, the probabilistic reasoning of NVSA with less expensive operations on the distributed representations is two orders of magnitude faster. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/neuro-vector-symbolic-architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with additional NVSA end-to-end training, generalization experiments, and PGM experiments</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15566v2)** | 2023-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge about space and time is necessary to solve problems in the physical world: An AI agent situated in the physical world and interacting with objects often needs to reason about positions of and relations between objects; and as soon as the agent plans its actions to solve a task, it needs to consider the temporal aspect (e.g., what actions to perform over time). Spatio-temporal knowledge, however, is required beyond interacting with the physical world, and is also often transferred to the abstract world of concepts through analogies and metaphors (e.g., "a threat that is hanging over our heads"). As spatial and temporal reasoning is ubiquitous, different attempts have been made to integrate this into AI systems. In the area of knowledge representation, spatial and temporal reasoning has been largely limited to modeling objects and relations and developing reasoning methods to verify statements about objects and relations. On the other hand, neural network researchers have tried to teach models to learn spatial relations from data with limited reasoning capabilities. Bridging the gap between these two approaches in a mutually beneficial way could allow us to tackle many complex real-world problems, such as natural language processing, visual question answering, and semantic image segmentation. In this chapter, we view this integration problem from the perspective of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Specifically, we propose a synergy between logical reasoning and machine learning that will be grounded on spatial and temporal knowledge. Describing some successful applications, remaining challenges, and evaluation datasets pertaining to this direction is the main topic of this contribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contribution to the book "A Compendium of Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence", which is to appear in the first half of 2023</p></details> |
| **[Is Neuro-Symbolic AI Meeting its Promise in Natural Language Processing? A Structured Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12205v2)** | 2022-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) assert that combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language, it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on github for further analysis.</p></details> | Survey |

Cognitive Science research provides valuable insights into the richness and complexity of analogical reasoning, together with implementations of expressive analogical reasoners with limited scalability. Modern scalable AI techniques with the potential to reason by analogy have been only applied to the special case of proportional analogy, and not to understanding higher-order analogies. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by: 1) formalizing six dimensions of analogy based on mature insights from Cognitive Science research, 2) annotating a corpus of fables with each of these dimensions, and 3) defining four tasks with increasing complexity that enable scalable evaluation of AI techniques. Experiments with language models and neuro-symbolic AI reasoners on these tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods can be applied to reason by analogy with a limited success, motivating the need for further research towards comprehensive and scalable analogical reasoning by AI. We make all our code and data available.</p></details> |  |

AI-based detection searches the image space to find the regions of interest based on patterns and features. There is a spectrum of tumor histologies from benign to malignant that can be identified by AI-based classification approaches using image features. The extraction of minable information from images gives way to the field of radiomics and can be explored via explicit (handcrafted/engineered) and deep radiomics frameworks. Radiomics analysis has the potential to be utilized as a noninvasive technique for the accurate characterization of tumors to improve diagnosis and treatment monitoring. This work reviews AI-based techniques, with a special focus on oncological PET and PET/CT imaging, for different detection, classification, and prediction/prognosis tasks. We also discuss needed efforts to enable the translation of AI techniques to routine clinical workflows, and potential improvements and complementary techniques such as the use of natural language processing on electronic health records and neuro-symbolic AI techniques.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in neuro-symbolic AI often consider specifically-tailored architectures consisting of disjoint neural and symbolic components, and thus do not exhibit desired gains that can be achieved by integrating them into a unifying framework. We introduce SLASH -- a novel deep probabilistic programming language (DPPL). At its core, SLASH consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and logical programs which are united via answer set programming. The probability estimates resulting from NPPs act as the binding element between the logical program and raw input data, thereby allowing SLASH to answer task-dependent logical queries. This allows SLASH to elegantly integrate the symbolic and neural components in a unified framework. We evaluate SLASH on the benchmark data of MNIST addition as well as novel tasks for DPPLs such as missing data prediction and set prediction with state-of-the-art performance, thereby showing the effectiveness and generality of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

With the recent success of deep learning, incorporating reasoning with deep learning systems, i.e., neuro-symbolic AI has become a major field of interest. We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Forward Reasoner (NSFR), a new approach for reasoning tasks taking advantage of differentiable forward-chaining using first-order logic. The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus, it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms, and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans, and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Combining Rules and Embeddings via Neuro-Symbolic AI for Knowledge Base Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09566v1)** | 2021-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interest in Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) has led to a plethora of approaches based on reinforcement learning, inductive logic programming and graph embeddings. In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules while being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within rule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying quality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these differences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the non-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few paths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all rule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that learn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of paths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by extending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to superior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in terms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of relation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving our results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.</p></details> |  |

Neuro-symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. They have also been shown to obtain high accuracy with significantly less training data than traditional models. Due to the recency of the field's emergence and relative sparsity of published results, the performance characteristics of these models are not well understood. In this paper, we describe and analyze the performance characteristics of three recent neuro-symbolic models. We find that symbolic models have less potential parallelism than traditional neural models due to complex control flow and low-operational-intensity operations, such as scalar multiplication and tensor addition. However, the neural aspect of computation dominates the symbolic part in cases where they are clearly separable. We also find that data movement poses a potential bottleneck, as it does in many ML workloads.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Modular Design Patterns for Hybrid Learning and Reasoning Systems: a taxonomy, patterns and use cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11965v2)** | 2021-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unification of statistical (data-driven) and symbolic (knowledge-driven) methods is widely recognised as one of the key challenges of modern AI. Recent years have seen large number of publications on such hybrid neuro-symbolic AI systems. That rapidly growing literature is highly diverse and mostly empirical, and is lacking a unifying view of the large variety of these hybrid systems. In this paper we analyse a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems, organised in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems. Our patterns reveal similarities between systems that were not recognised until now. Finally, our design patterns extend and refine Kautz' earlier attempt at categorising neuro-symbolic architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 22 figures, accepted for publication in the International Journal of Applied Intelligence</p></details> |

| **[Instantiation-based Formalization of Logical Reasoning Tasks using Language Models and Logical Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16961v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Network Information to Semantics for Generalizable and Plug-and-Play Multi-Scenario Network Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16842v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network fault diagnosis is a core challenge in ensuring the stability and reliability of modern network operations. Traditional approaches, limited by their training on specific performance metrics for predefined scenarios, struggle to generalize across diverse faults and anomalies in varying network environments. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various domains. Building on this success, we propose NetSemantic, a plug-and-play intelligent network fault diagnosis framework based on LLMs. NetSemantic transforms multimodal network information into unified textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and generate efficient fault resolutions and health assessment reports. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method that transforms logically strong network information into symbols. Additionally, we propose a self-adaptive data updating mechanism that dynamically incorporates network information into a knowledge graph to ensure the validity and timeliness of the knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that NetSemantic excels in network fault diagnosis across various complex scenarios, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | 10 pages,10 figures |
| **[DBRouting: Routing End User Queries to Databases for Answerability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16220v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise level data is often distributed across multiple sources and identifying the correct set-of data-sources with relevant information for a knowledge request is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we define the novel task of routing an end-user query to the appropriate data-source, where the data-sources are databases. We synthesize datasets by extending existing datasets designed for NL-to-SQL semantic parsing. We create baselines on these datasets by using open-source LLMs, using both pre-trained and task specific embeddings fine-tuned using the training data. With these baselines we demonstrate that open-source LLMs perform better than embedding based approach, but suffer from token length limitations. Embedding based approaches benefit from task specific fine-tuning, more so when there is availability of data in terms of database specific questions for training. We further find that the task becomes more difficult (i) with an increase in the number of data-sources, (ii) having data-sources closer in terms of their domains,(iii) having databases without external domain knowledge required to interpret its entities and (iv) with ambiguous and complex queries requiring more fine-grained understanding of the data-sources or logical reasoning for routing to an appropriate source. This calls for the need for developing more sophisticated solutions to better address the task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st Workshop on GenAI and RAG Systems for Enterprise at CIKM 2024 Conference. 10 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Interpret Your Decision: Logical Reasoning Regularization for Generalization in Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04492v5)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024 as Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as an Indirect Reasoner: Contrapositive and Contradiction for Automated Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03667v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, increasing attention has been focused on improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. Advanced methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants, are found to enhance their reasoning skills by designing suitable prompts or breaking down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems. However, little concentration has been put on exploring the reasoning process, \textit{i.e.}, we discovered that most methods resort to Direct Reasoning (DR) and disregard Indirect Reasoning (IR). This can make LLMs difficult to solve IR tasks, which are often encountered in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a Direct-Indirect Reasoning (DIR) method, which considers DR and IR as multiple parallel reasoning paths that are merged to derive the final answer. We stimulate LLMs to implement IR by crafting prompt templates incorporating the principles of contrapositive and contradiction. These templates trigger LLMs to assume the negation of the conclusion as true, combine it with the premises to deduce a conclusion, and utilize the logical equivalence of the contrapositive to enhance their comprehension of the rules used in the reasoning process. Our DIR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing variants of CoT methods. Experimental results on four datasets related to logical reasoning and mathematic proof demonstrate that our DIR method, when combined with various baseline methods, significantly outperforms all the original methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[SedarEval: Automated Evaluation using Self-Adaptive Rubrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15595v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called SedarEval, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. SedarEval consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach. We release our dataset at https://github.com/wwn1233/sedareval.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |
| **[Imperative Learning: A Self-supervised Neuro-Symbolic Learning Framework for Robot Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16087v5)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[JustLogic: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Deductive Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14851v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs), and substantial research efforts in recent years have aimed to enhance their deductive reasoning capabilities. However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that most state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs perform significantly worse than the human average, demonstrating substantial room for model improvement. All code and data are available at https://github.com/michaelchen-lab/JustLogic</p></details> |  |
| **[VERUS-LM: a Versatile Framework for Combining LLMs with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14540v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> |  |
| **[PIKE-RAG: sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11551v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite notable advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that expand large language model (LLM) capabilities through external retrieval, these systems often struggle to meet the complex and diverse needs of real-world industrial applications. The reliance on retrieval alone proves insufficient for extracting deep, domain-specific knowledge performing in logical reasoning from specialized corpora. To address this, we introduce sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmentation Generation (PIKE-RAG), focusing on extracting, understanding, and applying specialized knowledge, while constructing coherent rationale to incrementally steer LLMs toward accurate responses. Recognizing the diverse challenges of industrial tasks, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies tasks based on their complexity in knowledge extraction and application, allowing for a systematic evaluation of RAG systems' problem-solving capabilities. This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications. Furthermore, we propose knowledge atomizing and knowledge-aware task decomposition to effectively extract multifaceted knowledge from the data chunks and iteratively construct the rationale based on original query and the accumulated knowledge, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 figures, technique report</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics with Human Judgement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text predicates, often goes unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of sensitivity of existing metrics and their alignment with human judgement on FOL evaluation. Using ground-truth FOLs, we carefully designed various perturbations on the ground-truth to assess metric sensitivity. We sample FOL translation candidates for natural language statements and measure the ranking alignment between automatic metrics and human annotators. Our empirical findings highlight oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations, the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural perturbations, and FOL metric for operator perturbation. We also observe a closer alignment between BertScore and human judgement. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both alignment and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/RamyaKeerthy/AlignmentFOL</p></details> |
| **[Neural Probabilistic Circuits: Enabling Compositional and Interpretable Predictions through Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07021v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various domains but are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. While post hoc explanation methods attempt to address this issue, they often fail to accurately represent these black-box models, resulting in misleading or incomplete explanations. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inherently transparent model architecture called Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), which enable compositional and interpretable predictions through logical reasoning. In particular, an NPC consists of two modules: an attribute recognition model, which predicts probabilities for various attributes, and a task predictor built on a probabilistic circuit, which enables logical reasoning over recognized attributes to make class predictions. To train NPCs, we introduce a three-stage training algorithm comprising attribute recognition, circuit construction, and joint optimization. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that an NPC's error is upper-bounded by a linear combination of the errors from its modules. To further demonstrate the interpretability of NPC, we provide both the most probable explanations and the counterfactual explanations. Empirical results on four benchmark datasets show that NPCs strike a balance between interpretability and performance, achieving results competitive even with those of end-to-end black-box models while providing enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing and Enhancing the Robustness of Large Language Models with Task Structure Variations for Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09430v5)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, have advanced the performance of AI systems on various natural language processing tasks to human-like levels. However, their generalisation and robustness when performing logical reasoning has not been sufficiently assessed. To comprehensively evaluate this ability, we develop three new logical reasoning datasets named "ReClor-plus", "LogiQA-plus" and "LogiQAv2-plus" that extend standard logical reasoning datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LLM's reasoning. For each, we create three subsets: the first with randomly shuffled options, the second with the correct choices replaced by "none of the other options is correct", and the third with a combination of shuffling and substitution. Experiments on these datasets show that these simple augmentations greatly hinder the models' performance. Despite their high performance on the original publicly available datasets, we find that all models perform poorly on these newly constructed datasets. We also demonstrate that introducing task variations into the training set can markedly improve the model's performance on both the original and our developed datasets. Finally, we show that applying logic-driven data augmentation for fine-tuning and prompting can enhance generalisation in both discriminative and generative models, offering a path to improving their robustness for tasks involving logical reasoning.

| **[Multimodal-to-Text Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models Using Feature Embeddings for GNSS Interference Characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05079v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems applied across various domains, including NLP, information retrieval, and recommendation systems. Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18023v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In neuroscience, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems have evolved considerably with the popularization of visual language models. In this paper, we propose LeapVAD, a novel method based on cognitive perception and dual-process thinking. Our approach implements a human-attentional mechanism to identify and focus on critical traffic elements that influence driving decisions. By characterizing these objects through comprehensive attributes - including appearance, motion patterns, and associated risks - LeapVAD achieves more effective environmental representation and streamlines the decision-making process. Furthermore, LeapVAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module miming the human-driving learning process. The system consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) that accumulates driving experience through logical reasoning and a Heuristic Process (System-I) that refines this knowledge via fine-tuning and few-shot learning. LeapVAD also includes reflective mechanisms and a growing memory bank, enabling it to learn from past mistakes and continuously improve its performance in a closed-loop environment. To enhance efficiency, we develop a scene encoder network that generates compact scene representations for rapid retrieval of relevant driving experiences. Extensive evaluations conducted on two leading autonomous driving simulators, CARLA and DriveArena, demonstrate that LeapVAD achieves superior performance compared to camera-only approaches despite limited training data. Comprehensive ablation studies further emphasize its effectiveness in continuous learning and domain adaptation. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/LeapVAD/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning with Graphs: Structuring Implicit Knowledge to Enhance LLMs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07845v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of tasks; however, they still encounter challenges in reasoning tasks that require understanding and inferring relationships between distinct pieces of information within text sequences. This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial. Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks. However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided. Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning? In this paper, we propose Reasoning with Graphs (RwG) by first constructing explicit graphs from the context and then leveraging these graphs to enhance LLM reasoning performance on reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07752v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeLogic: A Temporal Logic Benchmark for Video QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07214v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logical understanding, a core facet of human cognition, plays a pivotal role in capturing complex sequential events and their temporal relationships within videos. This capability is particularly crucial in tasks like Video Question Answering (VideoQA), where the goal is to process visual data over time together with textual data to provide coherent answers. However, current VideoQA benchmarks devote little focus to evaluating this critical skill due to the challenge of annotating temporal logic. Despite the advancement of vision-language models, assessing their temporal logical reasoning powers remains a challenge, primarily due to the lack QA pairs that demand formal, complex temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the TimeLogic QA (TLQA) framework to automatically generate the QA pairs, specifically designed to evaluate the temporal logical understanding. To this end, TLQA leverages temporal annotations from existing video datasets together with temporal operators derived from logic theory to construct questions that test understanding of event sequences and their temporal relationships. TLQA framework is generic and scalable, capable of leveraging both, existing video action datasets with temporal action segmentation annotations, or video datasets with temporal scene graph annotations, to automatically generate temporal logical questions. We leverage 4 datasets, STAR, Breakfast, AGQA, and CrossTask, and generate two VideoQA dataset variants - small (TLQA-S) and large (TLQA-L) - containing 2k and 10k QA pairs for each category, resulting in 32k and 160k total pairs per dataset. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of leading-edge VideoQA models, employing the TLQA to benchmark their temporal logical understanding capabilities. We assess the VideoQA model's temporal reasoning performance on 16 categories of temporal logic with varying temporal complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 7.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

This capability is essential in applications such as industrial inspection, where logical anomaly detection is critical for maintaining high-quality standards and minimizing costly recalls. Previous research in anomaly detection (AD) has relied on prior knowledge for designing algorithms, which often requires extensive manual annotations, significant computing power, and large amounts of data for training. Autoregressive, multimodal Vision Language Models (AVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their exceptional performance in visual reasoning across various domains. Despite this, their application to logical AD remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate using AVLMs for logical AD and demonstrate that they are well-suited to the task. Combining AVLMs with format embedding and a logic reasoner, we achieve SOTA performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 86.0% and F1-max of 83.7%, along with explanations of anomalies. This significantly outperforms the existing SOTA method by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at aaai25, project page: https://jasonjin34.github.io/logicad.github.io/</p></details> |

It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Question Answering via Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18537v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI'2025</p></details> |
| **[SecBench: A Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking Dataset for LLMs in Cybersecurity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20787v3)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs. Benchmarking results on 16 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowRA: Knowledge Retrieval Augmented Method for Document-level Relation Extraction with Comprehensive Reasoning Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00571v2)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document-level relation extraction (Doc-RE) aims to extract relations between entities across multiple sentences. Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Model Acceleration based on KV Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19442v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. The curated paper list for KV cache management is in: \href{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Transformers for Generalizable First-Order Logical Entailment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00759v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, as a fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning. This paper investigates the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and explores ways to improve it. The first-order reasoning capability of transformers is assessed through their ability to perform first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) the unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, enabling a characterization of fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset show that transformers outperform previous methods specifically designed for this task and provide detailed empirical evidence on the impact of input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our findings reveal a mismatch between positional encoding and other design choices in transformer architectures employed in prior practices. This discovery motivates us to propose a more sophisticated, logic-aware architecture, TEGA, to enhance the capability for generalizable first-order logical entailment in transformers.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Traditionally, the control aspects of biomedical systems have been analyzed using manual proofs and computer based analysis tools. However, these approaches provide inaccurate results due to human error in manual proofs and unverified algorithms and round-off errors in computer-based tools. We argue using Interactive reasoning, or frequently called theorem proving, to analyze control systems of biomedical engineering applications, specifically in the context of Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). Our methodology involves constructing mathematical models of the control components using Higher-order Logic (HOL) and analyzing them through deductive reasoning in the HOL Light theorem prover. We propose to model these control systems in terms of their block diagram representations, which in turn utilize the corresponding differential equations and their transfer function-based representation using the Laplace Transform (LT). These formally represented block diagrams are then analyzed through logical reasoning in the trusted environment of a theorem prover to ensure the correctness of the results. For illustration, we present a real-world case study by analyzing the control system of the ultrafilteration dialysis process.</p></details> | <details><summary>11th ...</summary><p>11th International Conference on Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering (ICMRE), Lille, France, 2025</p></details> |
| **[OCRBench v2: An Improved Benchmark for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models on Visual Text Localization and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00321v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scoring the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has witnessed growing interest recently. Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities on certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios including street scene, receipt, formula, diagram, and so on), and thorough evaluation metrics, with a total of 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs on OCRBench v2, we find that 20 out of 22 LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/Yuliang-liu/MultimodalOCR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414v3)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side. The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distance-Restricted Explanations: Theoretical Underpinnings & Efficient Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08297v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The uses of machine learning (ML) have snowballed in recent years. In many cases, ML models are highly complex, and their operation is beyond the understanding of human decision-makers. Nevertheless, some uses of ML models involve high-stakes and safety-critical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help human decision-makers in understanding the operation of such complex ML models, thus eliciting trust in their operation. Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructTest: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning through Compositional Structured Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18011v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) necessitates robust, unbiased, and scalable methods for evaluating their capabilities. However, human annotations are expensive to scale, model-based evaluations are prone to biases in answer style, while target-answer-based benchmarks are vulnerable to data contamination and cheating. To address these limitations, we propose StructTest, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to produce compositionally specified structured outputs as an unbiased, cheap-to-run and difficult-to-cheat measure. The evaluation is done deterministically by a rule-based evaluator, which can be easily extended to new tasks. By testing structured outputs across diverse task domains -- including Summarization, Code, HTML and Math -- we demonstrate that StructTest serves as a good proxy for general reasoning abilities, as producing structured outputs often requires internal logical reasoning. We believe that StructTest offers a critical, complementary approach to objective and robust model evaluation.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$_{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$_{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

The transformer is the pervasive backbone architecture for the foundation model construction. It is vital to research how to adjust the Transformer architecture to achieve an end-to-end privacy guarantee in LLM fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate three potential information leakage during a federated fine-tuning procedure for LLM (FedLLM). Based on the potential information leakage, we provide an end-to-end privacy guarantee solution for FedLLM by inserting two-stage randomness. The first stage is to train a gradient auto-encoder with a Gaussian random prior based on the statistical information of the gradients generated by local clients. The second stage is to fine-tune the overall LLM with a differential privacy guarantee by adopting appropriate Gaussian noises. We show the efficiency and accuracy gains of our proposed method with several foundation models and two popular evaluation benchmarks. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive privacy analysis with Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP).</p></details> |  |
| **[Aristotle: Mastering Logical Reasoning with A Logic-Complete Decompose-Search-Resolve Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16953v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://github.com/Aiden0526/Aristotle.</p></details> |  |

However, their utility in tasks requiring advanced reasoning, such as generating and evaluating mathematical statements and proofs, remains underexplored. This study explores the use of Lean, a programming language for writing mathematical proofs, to populate the knowledge corpus used by RAG systems. We hope for this to lay the foundation to exploring different methods of using RAGs to improve the performance of LLMs in advanced logical reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses -- a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination, jailbreaking, etc. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitates an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are three-fold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries as input and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, specially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts.</p></details> | Under review |

Evaluating Interventions for Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15584v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust. Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with 400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making incorrect reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance interventions in human-LLM collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the need for efficient and accurate methods to harmonize the growing volume of survey data with standardized disease ontologies, we employed BERN2, a biomedical named entity recognition and normalization model, to extract disease information from the ORIGINS birth cohort survey data. After rigorously evaluating BERN2's performance against a manually curated ground truth dataset, we integrated various LLMs using prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Instructional Fine-Tuning (IFT) to refine the model's outputs. BERN2 demonstrated high performance in extracting and normalizing disease mentions, and the integration of LLMs, particularly with Few Shot Inference and RAG orchestration, further improved accuracy. This approach, especially when incorporating structured examples, logical reasoning prompts, and detailed context, offers a promising avenue for developing tools to enable efficient cohort profiling and data harmonization across large, heterogeneous research datasets.</p></details> |  |

By integrating these symbolic AI methods, we encode domain-specific constraints, rules, and logical reasoning directly into the model's learning process, thereby improving both performance and trustworthiness. The proposed approach is flexible and applicable to both regression and classification tasks, demonstrating generalizability across various fields such as healthcare, autonomous systems, engineering, and battery manufacturing applications. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, the strength of our approach lies in its scalability across different domains. The design allows for the automation of the loss function by simply updating the ASP rules, making the system highly scalable and user-friendly. This facilitates seamless adaptation to new domains without significant redesign, offering a practical solution for integrating expert knowledge into DL models in industrial settings such as battery manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well in generating accurate outputs, their "black box" nature poses significant challenges to transparency and trust. To address this, the paper proposes the TranspNet pipeline, which integrates symbolic AI with LLMs. By leveraging domain expert knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and formal reasoning frameworks like Answer Set Programming (ASP), TranspNet enhances LLM outputs with structured reasoning and verification.This approach strives to help AI systems deliver results that are as accurate, explainable, and trustworthy as possible, aligning with regulatory expectations for transparency and accountability. TranspNet provides a solution for developing AI systems that are reliable and interpretable, making it suitable for real-world applications where trust is critical.</p></details> |  |

However, an in-depth study on the relationship between knowledge proficiency, especially essential driving expertise, and closed-loop autonomous driving performance requires further exploration. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the depth and breadth of fundamental driving knowledge on closed-loop trajectory planning and introduce WiseAD, a specialized VLM tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving capable of driving reasoning, action justification, object recognition, risk analysis, driving suggestions, and trajectory planning across diverse scenarios. We employ joint training on driving knowledge and planning datasets, enabling the model to perform knowledge-aligned trajectory planning accordingly. Extensive experiments indicate that as the diversity of driving knowledge extends, critical accidents are notably reduced, contributing 11.9% and 12.4% improvements in the driving score and route completion on the Carla closed-loop evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, WiseAD also demonstrates remarkable performance in knowledge evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework with a new human-annotated dataset to pinpoint model strengths and weaknesses, advancing from single-skill tasks to multi-skill tasks, and ultimately to complex reasoning tasks that require the integration of multiple spatial and visual cues with logical reasoning. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source models reveal significant shortcomings, especially in the abilities to understand distance and proximity, to reason from both allocentric and egocentric viewpoints, and to perform complex reasoning in a physical context. This work underscores the need for more advanced approaches to spatial understanding and reasoning, paving the way for improvements in vision-language models and their alignment with human-like spatial capabilities. The dataset will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of using graph-based synthetic reasoning data as training signals to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our extensive experiments, conducted on two established natural language reasoning tasks -- inductive reasoning and spatial reasoning -- demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic graph-based reasoning data effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning performance without compromising their effectiveness on other standard evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Empowering Natural Language Proof Generation with Contrastive Stepwise Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06736v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning remains a pivotal component within the realm of artificial intelligence. The recent evolution of large language models (LLMs) has marked significant progress in this domain. The adoption of strategies like chain-of-thought (CoT) has enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, logical reasoning that involves proof planning, specifically those that necessitate the validation of explanation accuracy, continues to present stumbling blocks. In this study, we first evaluate the efficacy of LLMs with advanced CoT strategies concerning such tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs still struggle to navigate complex reasoning chains, which demand the meticulous linkage of premises to derive a cogent conclusion. To address this issue, we finetune a smaller-scale language model, equipping it to decompose proof objectives into more manageable subgoals.

| **[Benchmarking Table Comprehension In The Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09884v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), while being increasingly dominant on a myriad of knowledge-intensive activities, have only had limited success understanding lengthy table-text mixtures, such as academic papers and financial reports. Recent advances of long-context LLMs have opened up new possibilities for this field. Nonetheless, we identify two roadblocks: (1) Prior benchmarks of table question answering (TableQA) have focused on isolated tables without context, making it hard to evaluate models in real-world scenarios. (2) Prior benchmarks have focused on some narrow skill sets of table comprehension such as table recognition, data manipulation/calculation, table summarization etc., while a skilled human employs those skills collectively. In this work, we introduce TableQuest, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the holistic table comprehension capabilities of LLMs in the natural table-rich context of financial reports. We employ a rigorous data processing and filtering procedure to ensure that the question-answer pairs are logical, reasonable, and diverse. We experiment with 7 state-of-the-art models, and find that despite reasonable accuracy in locating facts, they often falter when required to execute more sophisticated reasoning or multi-step calculations. We conclude with a qualitative study of the failure modes and discuss the challenges of constructing a challenging benchmark. We make the evaluation data, judging procedure and results of this study publicly available to facilitate research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TRL Workshop@Neurips 2024.

| **[Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04264v5)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities through iterative feedback between LLMs and Answer Set Programming (ASP). We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting baseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with iterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP pipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82% accuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and 8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key innovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning through a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and ASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that addresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose Facts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance on complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis across different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini) demonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability, contributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RuleArena: A Benchmark for Rule-Guided Reasoning with LLMs in Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08972v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces RuleArena, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex, real-world rules in reasoning. Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. These results highlight significant challenges in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data and Codes are available at https://github.com/skyriver-2000/RuleArena</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning-Aware Query-Focused Summarization over Multi-Table Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08970v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-focused summarization over multi-table data is a challenging yet critical task for extracting precise and relevant information from structured data. Existing methods often rely on complex preprocessing steps and struggle to generalize across domains or handle the logical reasoning required for multi-table queries. In this paper, we propose QueryTableSummarizer++, an end-to-end generative framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced with table-aware pre-training, query-aligned fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with feedback. Our method eliminates the need for intermediate serialization steps and directly generates query-relevant summaries. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that QueryTableSummarizer++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-score. Additional analyses highlight its scalability, generalization across domains, and robust handling of complex queries. Human evaluation further validates the superior quality and practical applicability of the generated summaries, establishing QueryTableSummarizer++ as a highly effective solution for multi-table summarization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Categorical Syllogisms Revisited: A Review of the Logical Reasoning Abilities of LLMs for Analyzing Categorical Syllogism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18762v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There have been a huge number of benchmarks proposed to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) behave for logic inference tasks. However, it remains an open question how to properly evaluate this ability. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of prior works on the logical reasoning ability of LLMs for analyzing categorical syllogisms. We first investigate all the possible variations for the categorical syllogisms from a purely logical perspective and then examine the underlying configurations (i.e., mood and figure) tested by the existing datasets. Our results indicate that compared to template-based synthetic datasets, crowdsourcing approaches normally sacrifice the coverage of configurations (i.e., mood and figure) of categorical syllogisms for more language variations, thus bringing challenges to fully testing LLMs under different situations. We then proceed to summarize the findings and observations for the performances of LLMs to infer the validity of syllogisms from the current literature. The error rate breakdown analyses suggest that the interpretation of the quantifiers seems to be the current bottleneck that limits the performances of the LLMs and is thus worth more attention. Finally, we discuss several points that might be worth considering when researchers plan on the future release of categorical syllogism datasets. We hope our work will not only provide a timely review of the current literature regarding categorical syllogisms, but also motivate more interdisciplinary research between communities, specifically computational linguists and logicians.</p></details> | camera-ready version |
| **[Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08054v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents. The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data. However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions. The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters. Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL. In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods. Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithmic Phase Transitions in Language Models: A Mechanistic Case Study of Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07386v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot capabilities of large language models make them powerful tools for solving a range of tasks without explicit training. It remains unclear, however, how these models achieve such performance, or why they can zero-shot some tasks but not others. In this paper, we shed some light on this phenomenon by defining and investigating algorithmic stability in language models -- changes in problem-solving strategy employed by the model as a result of changes in task specification. We focus on a task where algorithmic stability is needed for generalization: two-operand arithmetic. Surprisingly, we find that Gemma-2-2b employs substantially different computational models on closely related subtasks, i.e. four-digit versus eight-digit addition. Our findings suggest that algorithmic instability may be a contributing factor to language models' poor zero-shot performance across certain logical reasoning tasks, as they struggle to abstract different problem-solving strategies and smoothly transition between them.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve. We perform our study on two fronts. First, we pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch and attains perfect test accuracy, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" mechanisms in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. Second, we study how pretrained LLMs, namely Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B, solve this problem. We characterize their reasoning circuits through causal intervention experiments, providing necessity and sufficiency evidence for the circuits. We find evidence suggesting that the two models' latent reasoning strategies are surprisingly similar, and human-like. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can OpenAI o1 outperform humans in higher-order cognitive thinking?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05753v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates the performance of OpenAI's o1-preview model in higher-order cognitive domains, including critical thinking, systematic thinking, computational thinking, data literacy, creative thinking, logical reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Using established benchmarks, we compared the o1-preview models's performance to human participants from diverse educational levels. o1-preview achieved a mean score of 24.33 on the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test (EWCTET), surpassing undergraduate (13.8) and postgraduate (18.39) participants (z = 1.60 and 0.90, respectively). In systematic thinking, it scored 46.1, SD = 4.12 on the Lake Urmia Vignette, significantly outperforming the human mean (20.08, SD = 8.13, z = 3.20). For data literacy, o1-preview scored 8.60, SD = 0.70 on Merk et al.'s "Use Data" dimension, compared to the human post-test mean of 4.17, SD = 2.02 (z = 2.19). On creative thinking tasks, the model achieved originality scores of 2.98, SD = 0.73, higher than the human mean of 1.74 (z = 0.71). In logical reasoning (LogiQA), it outperformed humans with average 90%, SD = 10% accuracy versus 86%, SD = 6.5% (z = 0.62). For scientific reasoning, it achieved near-perfect performance (mean = 0.99, SD = 0.12) on the TOSLS,, exceeding the highest human scores of 0.85, SD = 0.13 (z = 1.78). While o1-preview excelled in structured tasks, it showed limitations in problem-solving and adaptive reasoning. These results demonstrate the potential of AI to complement education in structured assessments but highlight the need for ethical oversight and refinement for broader applications.</p></details> |  |

Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04937v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeiSAM: Segment Anything with Deictic Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14123v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale, pre-trained neural networks have demonstrated strong capabilities in various tasks, including zero-shot image segmentation. To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as "The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Our approach leverages the concept of hot and cold tokens, where hot tokens are prioritized for their contextual relevance, while cold tokens provide supplementary information. This dynamic modulation of token importance enables the model to achieve superior logical reasoning capabilities compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that our temperature-guided attention mechanism converges to optimal reasoning paths with exponential guarantees. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across a wide range of tasks, making advanced AI reasoning accessible to a broader range of applications.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, researchers have employed carefully designed prompts and flowcharts, simulating human cognitive processes to enhance LLM performance, such as the Chain of Thought approach. In this paper, we introduce MTMT (Multi-thinking Modes Tree), a novel method that interacts with LLMs to construct a thought tree, simulating various advanced cognitive processes, including but not limited to association, counterfactual thinking, task decomposition, and comparison. By breaking down the original complex task into simpler sub-questions, MTMT facilitates easier problem-solving for LLMs, enabling more effective utilization of the latent knowledge within LLMs. We evaluate the performance of MTMT under different parameter configurations, using GPT-4o mini as the base model. Our results demonstrate that integrating multiple modes of thinking significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Multi-Hop Question Answering with Knowledge Graph Integration in Evolving Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15903v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The important challenge of keeping knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) up-to-date has led to the development of various methods for incorporating new facts. However, existing methods for such knowledge editing still face difficulties with multi-hop questions that require accurate fact identification and sequential logical reasoning, particularly among numerous fact updates. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straightforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits.</p></details> |  |

However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recent techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, have significantly advanced multi-step reasoning by introducing step-by-step decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, these approaches often rely on static prompting templates that do not adapt to task complexity or errors during the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Prompting, a dynamic and iterative framework designed to enhance reasoning by incorporating real-time adjustments to prompt structures and validation mechanisms.Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Prompting significantly improves performance on diverse reasoning benchmarks, including arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, MultiArith), logical reasoning and commonsense tasks, achieving substantial accuracy gains compared to static prompting baselines. By integrating guided prompts, intermediate validation, and self-corrective steps, our approach enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger counterparts, such as GPT-4, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework achieves this without requiring fine-tuning or task-specific training data, highlighting the untapped potential of iterative reasoning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2025.

Humans excel at these tasks by leveraging deliberate planning with an internal world model to simulate the potential outcomes of various actions. Inspired by this, we propose a novel multi-step reasoning framework for LLMs, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with Accurate World Model (SWAP). Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in natural language, SWAP incorporates structural information to guide the reasoning process via a world model and provides a soft verification mechanism over the steps. Moreover, SWAP overcomes the challenge of accurate world state predictions in complex reasoning tasks by introducing a Generator-Discriminator architecture, which enables more reliable world modeling. Specifically, the generator predicts the next state, and the discriminator ensures alignment with the logical consistency required by the problem context. SWAP also encourages the policy model to explore a broad range of potential actions to prevent premature convergence. By resolving the bottlenecks of generation diversity for both actions and states using diversity-based modeling (DBM) and improving discrimination accuracy through contrastive ranking (CR), SWAP significantly enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP achieves substantial improvements over the baselines and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Large Multimodal Models with Visual Programming Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18932v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have showcased impressive code generation capabilities, primarily evaluated through image-to-code benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are limited to specific visual programming scenarios where the logic reasoning and the multimodal understanding capacities are split apart. To fill this gap, we propose ScratchEval, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the visual programming reasoning ability of LMMs. ScratchEval is based on Scratch, a block-based visual programming language widely used in children's programming education. By integrating visual elements and embedded programming logic, ScratchEval requires the model to process both visual information and code structure, thereby comprehensively evaluating its programming intent understanding ability. Our evaluation approach goes beyond the traditional image-to-code mapping and focuses on unified logical thinking and problem-solving abilities, providing a more comprehensive and challenging framework for evaluating the visual programming ability of LMMs. ScratchEval not only fills the gap in existing evaluation methods, but also provides new insights for the future development of LMMs in the field of visual programming.

However, their ability in open environments remains constrained, particularly in long-horizon tasks. In contrast, traditional symbolic planning excels in long-horizon tasks through logical reasoning over human-defined symbolic spaces but struggles to handle observations beyond symbolic states, such as high-dimensional visual inputs encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we draw inspiration from abductive learning and introduce a novel framework \textbf{AB}ductive \textbf{I}mitation \textbf{L}earning (ABIL) that integrates the benefits of data-driven learning and symbolic-based reasoning, enabling long-horizon planning. Specifically, we employ abductive reasoning to understand the demonstrations in symbolic space and design the principles of sequential consistency to resolve the conflicts between perception and reasoning. ABIL generates predicate candidates to facilitate the perception from raw observations to symbolic space without laborious predicate annotations, providing a groundwork for symbolic planning. With the symbolic understanding, we further develop a policy ensemble whose base policies are built with different logical objectives and managed through symbolic reasoning.

To address this, we propose the Sentiment Cross-Lingual Recognition and Logic Framework (SentiXRL), which incorporates two modules,an emotion retrieval enhancement module to improve sentiment classification accuracy in complex contexts through historical dialogue and logical reasoning,and a self-circulating analysis negotiation mechanism (SANM)to facilitates autonomous decision-making within a single model for classification tasks.We have validated SentiXRL's superiority on multiple standard datasets, outperforming existing models on CPED and CH-SIMS,and achieving overall better performance on MELD,Emorynlp and IEMOCAP. Notably, we unified labels across several fine-grained sentiment annotation datasets and conducted category confusion experiments, revealing challenges and impacts of class imbalance in standard datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIE: MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable AIGC Image Implausibility Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17261v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details; and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Visual Assessment for Text-to-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15509v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation models have achieved remarkable progress in computer graphics applications but still face significant challenges in real-world deployment. Current assessment approaches for visual generation tasks typically follow an isolated three-phase framework: test input collection, model output generation, and user assessment. These fashions suffer from fixed coverage, evolving difficulty, and data leakage risks, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively evaluating increasingly complex generation models. To address these limitations, we propose DyEval, an LLM-powered dynamic interactive visual assessment framework that facilitates collaborative evaluation between humans and generative models for text-to-image systems. DyEval features an intuitive visual interface that enables users to interactively explore and analyze model behaviors, while adaptively generating hierarchical, fine-grained, and diverse textual inputs to continuously probe the capability boundaries of the models based on their feedback. Additionally, to provide interpretable analysis for users to further improve tested models, we develop a contextual reflection module that mines failure triggers of test inputs and reflects model potential failure patterns supporting in-depth analysis using the logical reasoning ability of LLM. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DyEval can effectively help users identify max up to 2.56 times generation failures than conventional methods, and uncover complex and rare failure patterns, such as issues with pronoun generation and specific cultural context generation. Our framework provides valuable insights for improving generative models and has broad implications for advancing the reliability and capabilities of visual generation systems across various domains.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[XAgents: A Framework for Interpretable Rule-Based Multi-Agents Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13932v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting implicit knowledge and logical reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) has consistently been a significant challenge. The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p></details> |  |

This is motivated by the fact that the rich combinatorial nature of data in certain reasoning tasks (e.g., arithmetic/logic) makes representative data sampling challenging, and learning successfully under GOTU gives a first vignette of an 'extrapolating' or 'reasoning' learner. We study how different network architectures trained by (S)GD perform under GOTU and provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that for sparse functions and a class of network models including instances of Transformers, random features models, and linear networks, a min-degree-interpolator is learned on the unseen. More specifically, this means an interpolator of the training data that has minimal Fourier mass on the higher degree basis elements. These findings lead to two implications: (1) we provide an explanation to the length generalization problem for Boolean functions (e.g., Anil et al. 2022); (2) we introduce a curriculum learning algorithm called Degree-Curriculum that learns monomials more efficiently by incrementing supports. Finally, we discuss extensions to other models or non-sparse regimes where the min-degree bias may still occur or fade, as well as how it can be potentially corrected when undesirable.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended JMLR version of the original ICML 2023 paper</p></details> |
| **[Testing Uncertainty of Large Language Models for Physics Knowledge and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14465v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in recent years for their ability to answer questions in various fields. However, these models have a tendency to "hallucinate" their responses, making it challenging to evaluate their performance. A major challenge is determining how to assess the certainty of a model's predictions and how it correlates with accuracy. In this work, we introduce an analysis for evaluating the performance of popular open-source LLMs, as well as gpt-3.5 Turbo, on multiple choice physics questionnaires. We focus on the relationship between answer accuracy and variability in topics related to physics. Our findings suggest that most models provide accurate replies in cases where they are certain, but this is by far not a general behavior. The relationship between accuracy and uncertainty exposes a broad horizontal bell-shaped distribution. We report how the asymmetry between accuracy and uncertainty intensifies as the questions demand more logical reasoning of the LLM agent, while the same relationship remains sharp for knowledge retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for programs with effects, nondeterminism, and nontermination is difficult. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not executable code, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics. Reasoning about infinite traces and automata requires complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a structural approach to the verification of temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call Ticl. Using Ticl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform mechanized proofs of general temporal properties, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of ticl by giving short, structural proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with queues, secure memory, and distributed consensus.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

The study utilizes their logical reasoning, scene understanding, and decision-making capabilities to optimize throughput and provide feedback based on traffic conditions in real-time. LLMs centralize traditionally disconnected traffic control processes and can integrate traffic data from diverse sources to provide context-aware decisions. LLMs can also deliver tailored outputs using various means such as wireless signals and visuals to drivers, infrastructures, and autonomous vehicles. To evaluate LLMs ability as traffic controllers, this study proposed a four-stage methodology. The methodology includes data creation and environment initialization, prompt engineering, conflict identification, and fine-tuning. We simulated multi-lane four-leg intersection scenarios and generates detailed datasets to enable conflict detection using LLMs and Python simulation as a ground truth. We used chain-of-thought prompts to lead LLMs in understanding the context, detecting conflicts, resolving them using traffic rules, and delivering context-sensitive traffic management solutions. We evaluated the prformance GPT-mini, Gemini, and Llama as traffic controllers. Results showed that the fine-tuned GPT-mini achieved 83% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.84. GPT-mini model exhibited a promising performance in generating actionable traffic management insights, with high ROUGE-L scores across conflict identification of 0.95, decision-making of 0.91, priority assignment of 0.94, and waiting time optimization of 0.92. We demonstrated that LLMs can offer precise recommendations to drivers in real-time including yielding, slowing, or stopping based on vehicle dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The data and code that support the findings of this study are openly available in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14171745, reference number 14171745</p></details> |
| **[AutoIoT: Automated IoT Platform Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10665v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IoT platforms, particularly smart home platforms providing significant convenience to people's lives such as Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings, allow users to create automation rules through trigger-action programming. However, some users may lack the necessary knowledge to formulate automation rules, thus preventing them from fully benefiting from the conveniences offered by smart home technology. To address this, smart home platforms provide pre-defined automation policies based on the smart home devices registered by the user. Nevertheless, these policies, being pre-generated and relatively simple, fail to adequately cover the diverse needs of users. Furthermore, conflicts may arise between automation rules, and integrating conflict detection into the IoT platform increases the burden on developers. In this paper, we propose AutoIoT, an automated IoT platform based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and formal verification techniques, designed to achieve end-to-end automation through device information extraction, LLM-based rule generation, conflict detection, and avoidance. AutoIoT can help users generate conflict-free automation rules and assist developers in generating codes for conflict detection, thereby enhancing their experience. A code adapter has been designed to separate logical reasoning from the syntactic details of code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code for programming languages beyond their training data. Finally, we evaluated the performance of AutoIoT and presented a case study demonstrating how AutoIoT can integrate with existing IoT platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces a simulation framework utilizing the game Balderdash to evaluate both the creativity and logical reasoning of LLMs. In Balderdash, players generate fictitious definitions for obscure terms to deceive others while identifying correct definitions. Our framework enables multiple LLM agents to participate in this game, assessing their ability to produce plausible definitions and strategize based on game rules and history. We implemented a centralized game engine featuring various LLMs as participants and a judge LLM to evaluate semantic equivalence. Through a series of experiments, we analyzed the performance of different LLMs, examining metrics such as True Definition Ratio, Deception Ratio, and Correct Guess Ratio. The results provide insights into the creative and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Specifically, the study reveals that infrequent vocabulary in LLMs' input leads to poor reasoning on game rules and historical context (https://github.com/ParsaHejabi/Simulation-Framework-for-Multi-Agent-Balderdash).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Wordplay: When Language Meets Games @ ACL 2024</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks, were not designed to capture more than a few of these aspects. Whereas deep learning datasets focus on visually complex data but simple visual reasoning tasks, inductive logic datasets involve complex logical learning tasks, however, lack the visual component. To address this, we propose the diagnostic visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Train, - a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL-Train provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even SOTA AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations of each methodology. Overall, V-LoL opens up new avenues for understanding and enhancing current abilities in visual logical learning for AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689v3)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models. How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Unstructured Data to In-Context Learning: Exploring What Tasks Can Be Learned and When](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00131v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like transformers demonstrate impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, allowing them to make predictions for new tasks based on prompt exemplars without parameter updates. While existing ICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g., x-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on unstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks like word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models trained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements and training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities can emerge simply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured data; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through co-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms. However, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks requiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where ICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new, unseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs appear only in fixed training positions. These findings suggest that LLMs' ICL abilities depend heavily on the structural elements within their training data.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[Knowledge Authoring with Factual English, Rules, and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06253v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge representation and reasoning systems represent knowledge as collections of facts and rules. KRRs can represent complex concepts and relations, and they can query and manipulate information in sophisticated ways. Unfortunately, the KRR technology has been hindered by the fact that specifying the requisite knowledge requires skills that most domain experts do not have, and professional knowledge engineers are hard to find. Some recent CNL-based approaches, such as the Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine (KALM), have shown to have very high accuracy compared to others, and a natural question is to what extent the CNL restrictions can be lifted. Besides the CNL restrictions, KALM has limitations in terms of the types of knowledge it can represent. To address these issues, we propose an extension of KALM called KALM for Factual Language (KALMF). KALMF uses a neural parser for natural language, MS, to parse what we call factual English sentences, which require little grammar training to use. Building upon KALMF, we propose KALM for Rules and Actions (KALMR), to represent and reason with rules and actions. Furthermore, we identify the reasons behind the slow speed of KALM and make optimizations to address this issue. Our evaluation using multiple benchmarks shows that our approaches achieve a high level of correctness on fact and query authoring (95%) and on rule authoring (100%). When used for authoring and reasoning with actions, our approach achieves more than 99.3% correctness, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling more sophisticated knowledge representation and reasoning. We also illustrate the logical reasoning capabilities of our approach by drawing attention to the problems faced by the famous AI, ChatGPT. Finally, the evaluation of the newly proposed speed optimization points not only to a 68% runtime improvement but also yields better accuracy of the overall system.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

However, some suggest the excellence might be partially due to the model "memorizing" solutions, resulting in less satisfactory performance when prompted with problems not in the training data. We conduct a comparison experiment using two datasets: one consisting of International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) problems, which is easily accessible; the other one consisting of Chinese National Team Training camp (CNT) problems, which have similar difficulty but not as publically accessible. We label the response for each problem and compare the performance between the two datasets. We conclude that there is no significant evidence to show that the model relies on memorizing problems and solutions. Also, we perform case studies to analyze some features of the model's response.</p></details> |  |

However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline.

In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.</p></details> | Preprint |

We notice the challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction, and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness in reasoning tasks remains an open question. To this end, in this paper, we focus on two popular reasoning tasks: arithmetic reasoning and code generation.

| **[LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00773v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI. All the code and data are open-sourced at our website.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Chain of Preference Optimization: Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09136v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding has enabled large language models (LLMs) to generate explicit logical reasoning paths for complex problem-solving. However, research indicates that these paths are not always deliberate and optimal. The tree-of-thought (ToT) method employs tree-searching to extensively explore the reasoning space and find better reasoning paths that CoT decoding might overlook. This deliberation, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased inference complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs leveraging the search tree constructed by ToT allows CoT to achieve similar or better performance, thereby avoiding the substantial inference burden. This is achieved through Chain of Preference Optimization (CPO), where LLMs are fine-tuned to align each step of the CoT reasoning paths with those of ToT using the inherent preference information in the tree-search process. Extensive experimental results show that CPO significantly improves LLM performance in solving a variety of complex problems, including question answering, fact verification, and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness.

| **[On Memorization of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We found that LLMs could interpolate the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet fail when those puzzles are slightly perturbed, suggesting that the models heavily rely on memorization to solve those training puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. In-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers suggest that the LLMs learn to reason on K&K puzzles despite training data memorization. This phenomenon indicates that LLMs exhibit a complex interplay between memorization and genuine reasoning abilities. Finally, our analysis with per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization in solving logical puzzles.

| **[Leveraging LLMs for Hypothetical Deduction in Logical Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21779v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable potential across a wide array of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning. Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

| **[Neuro-symbolic Learning Yielding Logical Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20957v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic systems combine the abilities of neural perception and logical reasoning. However, end-to-end learning of neuro-symbolic systems is still an unsolved challenge. This paper proposes a natural framework that fuses neural network training, symbol grounding, and logical constraint synthesis into a coherent and efficient end-to-end learning process. The capability of this framework comes from the improved interactions between the neural and the symbolic parts of the system in both the training and inference stages. Technically, to bridge the gap between the continuous neural network and the discrete logical constraint, we introduce a difference-of-convex programming technique to relax the logical constraints while maintaining their precision. We also employ cardinality constraints as the language for logical constraint learning and incorporate a trust region method to avoid the degeneracy of logical constraint in learning. Both theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2023, and code is available at [this url](https://github.com/Lizn-zn/Nesy-Programming)</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Theoretical Understanding of the 'Reversal Curse' via Training Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04669v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) show impressive capacities to solve many complex reasoning tasks while struggling with some simple logical reasoning tasks such as inverse search: when trained on '$A \to B$' (e.g., 'Tom is the parent of John'), LLM fails to directly conclude '$B \gets A$' (e.g., 'John is the child of Tom') during inference even if the two sentences are semantically identical, which is known as the 'reversal curse'. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the reversal curse via the training dynamics of (stochastic) gradient descent for two auto-regressive models: (1) a bilinear model that can be viewed as a simplification of a one-layer transformer; (2) one-layer transformers under certain assumptions. Our analysis reveals that for both models, the reversal curse is a consequence of the (effective) model weights 'asymmetry', i.e., the increase of weights from a token $A$ to token $B$ during training does not necessarily cause the increase of the weights from $B$ to $A$, which is caused by the training dynamics under certain choice of loss function and the optimization space of model parameters. Moreover, our analysis can be naturally applied to other logical reasoning tasks such as chain-of-thought (COT), which provides a new perspective different from previous work that focuses on expressivity. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate our theory on multi-layer transformers under different settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/marlo-z/reversal_curse_analysis/.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 18 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning or a Semblance of it? A Diagnostic Study of Transitive Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20200v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks demonstrates their ability to solve compositional questions. However, little is known of whether these models engage in genuine logical reasoning or simply rely on implicit cues to generate answers. In this paper, we investigate the transitive reasoning capabilities of two distinct LLM architectures, LLaMA 2 and Flan-T5, by manipulating facts within two compositional datasets: QASC and Bamboogle. We controlled for potential cues that might influence the models' performance, including (a) word/phrase overlaps across sections of test input; (b) models' inherent knowledge during pre-training or fine-tuning; and (c) Named Entities. Our findings reveal that while both models leverage (a), Flan-T5 shows more resilience to experiments (b and c), having less variance than LLaMA 2. This suggests that models may develop an understanding of transitivity through fine-tuning on knowingly relevant datasets, a hypothesis we leave to future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in EMNLP Main 2024</p></details> |
| **[Continuously Learning, Adapting, and Improving: A Dual-Process Approach to Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15324v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has advanced significantly due to sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence improvements. However, prevailing methods struggle with intricate scenarios and causal relationships, hindering adaptability and interpretability in varied environments. To address the above problems, we introduce LeapAD, a novel paradigm for autonomous driving inspired by the human cognitive process. Specifically, LeapAD emulates human attention by selecting critical objects relevant to driving decisions, simplifying environmental interpretation, and mitigating decision-making complexities. Additionally, LeapAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module, which consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) for thorough analysis and reasoning, along with a Heuristic Process (System-I) for swift and empirical processing. The Analytic Process leverages its logical reasoning to accumulate linguistic driving experience, which is then transferred to the Heuristic Process by supervised fine-tuning. Through reflection mechanisms and a growing memory bank, LeapAD continuously improves itself from past mistakes in a closed-loop environment. Closed-loop testing in CARLA shows that LeapAD outperforms all methods relying solely on camera input, requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less labeled data. Experiments also demonstrate that as the memory bank expands, the Heuristic Process with only 1.8B parameters can inherit the knowledge from a GPT-4 powered Analytic Process and achieve continuous performance improvement.
