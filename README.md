| **[Fast globally optimal Truncated Least Squares point cloud registration with fixed rotation axis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15613v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Connections Between Association Schemes and Analyses of Polyhedral and Positive Semidefinite Lift-and-Project Relaxations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08628v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore some connections between association schemes and the analyses of the semidefinite programming (SDP) based convex relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems in the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver lift-and-project hierarchy. Our analysis of the relaxations of the stable set polytope leads to bounds on the clique and stability numbers of some regular graphs reminiscent of classical bounds by Delsarte and Hoffman, as well as the notion of deeply vertex-transitive graphs -- highly symmetric graphs that we show arise naturally from some association schemes. We also study relaxations of the hypergraph matching problem, and determine exactly or provide bounds on the lift-and-project ranks of these relaxations. Our proofs for these results also inspire the study of a homogeneous coherent configuration based on hypermatchings, which is an association scheme except it is generally non-commutative. We then illustrate the usefulness of obtaining commutative subschemes from non-commutative homogeneous coherent configurations via contraction in this context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure As Search: Unsupervised Permutation Learning for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04164v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations, without requiring explicit search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Learning for Quadratic Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20001v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PLUME search, a data-driven framework that enhances search efficiency in combinatorial optimization through unsupervised learning. Unlike supervised or reinforcement learning, PLUME search learns directly from problem instances using a permutation-based loss with a non-autoregressive approach. We evaluate its performance on the quadratic assignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard problem that encompasses various combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[A Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Longest Run Subsequence Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14020v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly. In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem. Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement, especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[e-boost: Boosted E-Graph Extraction with Adaptive Heuristics and Exact Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13020v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However, traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities, guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster. Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at https://github.com/Yu-Maryland/e-boost.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoCut: Strengthening Integer Programs via Evolution-Guided Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11850v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i) initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57% within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at https://github.com/milad1378yz/EvoCut.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Random-Key Optimizer for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04293v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored for combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available (Github public repository: github.com/RKO-solver), is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[MDNS: Masked Diffusion Neural Sampler via Stochastic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10684v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural $\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Parallel Relaxation for Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02190v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding the optimal solution is often the primary goal in combinatorial optimization (CO). However, real-world applications frequently require diverse solutions rather than a single optimum, particularly in two key scenarios. The first scenario occurs in real-world applications where strictly enforcing every constraint is neither necessary nor desirable. Allowing minor constraint violations can often lead to more cost-effective solutions. This is typically achieved by incorporating the constraints as penalty terms in the objective function, which requires careful tuning of penalty parameters. The second scenario involves cases where CO formulations tend to oversimplify complex real-world factors, such as domain knowledge, implicit trade-offs, or ethical considerations. To address these challenges, generating (i) penalty-diversified solutions by varying penalty intensities and (ii) variation-diversified solutions with distinct structural characteristics provides valuable insights, enabling practitioners to post-select the most suitable solution for their specific needs. However, efficiently discovering these diverse solutions is more challenging than finding a single optimal one. This study introduces Continual Parallel Relaxation Annealing (CPRA), a computationally efficient framework for unsupervised-learning (UL)-based CO solvers that generates diverse solutions within a single training run. CPRA leverages representation learning and parallelization to automatically discover shared representations, substantially accelerating the search for these diverse solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CPRA outperforms existing UL-based solvers in generating these diverse solutions while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10520v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Cross-problem Generalization in Diffusion-Based Neural Combinatorial Solver via Inference Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12188v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CO-Bench: Benchmarking Language Model Agents in Algorithm Search for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04310v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems -- a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agentic frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing the strengths and limitations of existing LLM agents and identifying promising directions for future research. CO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08778v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing (FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA). According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced performance of exploration and exploitation which we call exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale problems with correspondingly low computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages and 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning on the Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08718v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50, and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from worst-case scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Out of the Past: An AI-Enabled Pipeline for Traffic Simulation from Noisy, Multimodal Detector Data and Stakeholder Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21349v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can a traffic simulation be designed to faithfully reflect real-world traffic conditions? One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[RIDGECUT: Learning Graph Partitioning with Rings and Wedges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13986v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful tool for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems due to its ability to learn heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating knowledge that will steer the RL framework for CO solutions towards domain appropriate outcomes remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose RIDGECUT, the first RL framework that constrains the action space to enforce structure-aware partitioning in the Normalized Cut problem. Using transportation networks as a motivating example, we introduce a novel concept that leverages domain knowledge about urban road topology -- where natural partitions often take the form of concentric rings and radial wedges. Our method reshapes the graph into a linear or circular structure to simplify the partitioning task so that we can apply sequential transformers and enables efficient learning via Proximal Policy Optimization. The resulting partitions are not only aligned with expected spatial layouts but also achieve lower normalized cuts compared to existing methods. While we focus on traffic data, our approach is broadly applicable and offers a mechanism for embedding structural priors into RL for graph partitioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[IP Models for Minimum Zero Forcing Sets, Forts, and Related Graph Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07293v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero forcing is a binary coloring game on a graph where a set of filled vertices can force non-filled vertices to become filled following a color change rule. In 2008, the zero forcing number of a graph was shown to be an upper bound on its maximum nullity. In addition, the combinatorial optimization problem for the zero forcing number was shown to be NP-hard. Since then, the study of zero forcing and its related parameters has received considerable attention. In 2018, the forts of a graph were defined as non-empty subsets of vertices where no vertex outside the set has exactly one neighbor in the set. Forts have been used to model zero forcing as an integer program and provide lower bounds on the zero forcing number. To date, three integer programming models have been developed for the zero forcing number of a graph: the Infection Model, Time Step Model, and Fort Cover Model. In this article, we present variations of these models for computing the zero forcing number and related graph parameters, such as the minimum and maximum propagation times, throttling number, and fractional zero forcing number. In addition, we present several new models for computing the realized propagation time interval, all minimal forts of a graph, and the fort number of a graph. We conclude with several numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our models when applied to small and medium order graphs. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence for several open conjectures regarding the propagation time interval, the number of minimal forts, the fort number, and the fractional zero forcing number of a graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Efficient and Reliable Hitting-Set Computations for the Implicit Hitting Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07015v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively. IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer programming. We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP) optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI, this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies, certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15978v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), its hybrid quantum-classical solver (HA), as well as the third-generation Digital Annealer (DAv3) and Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO) developed by Fujitsu. The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 pseudo code, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off (using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Decomposition Strategies and Multi-shot ASP Solving for Job-shop Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07537v6)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Previous works have designed a plethora of hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.</p></details> |  |

For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+2 ...</summary><p>13+2 pages, 11+3 figures, accepted by Physical Review Research</p></details> |

While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and, more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed base node distribution.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.</p></details> | 34 pages |

The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGPO: Vision-augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization for the Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01774v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in the QAOA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087v6)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph is similarly limited in performance as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by the QAOA for even $q\ge 4$, Max-$q$-XORSAT is bounded away from optimality when optimised using asymptotic analysis due to the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Furthermore, the extension to logarithmic depth leads to a tightening of the upper bound that the QAOA outputs at logarithmic depth for MaxCUT and Max-$q$-XORSAT problems. We also provide some numerical evidence the limitation should be extended to odd $q$ by showing that the OGP exists for the Max-$3$-XORSAT on random regular graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, to be published in the journal of quantum information and computation</p></details> |

Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the network prebunking problem, to identify optimal prebunking targets for minimizing the spread of misinformation in a social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose an approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</p></details> |  |

While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

It has been shown that local search versions of various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20632v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[An integer programming-based approach to construct exact two-sample binomial tests with maximum power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13689v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional hypothesis tests for differences between binomial proportions are at risk of being too liberal (Wald test) or overly conservative (Fisher's exact test). This problem is exacerbated in small samples. Regulators favour exact tests, which provide robust type I error control, even though they may have lower power than non-exact tests. To target an exact test with high power, we extend and evaluate an overlooked approach, proposed in 1969, which determines the rejection region through a binary decision for each outcome vector and uses integer programming to, in line with the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, find an optimal decision boundary that maximizes a power objective subject to type I error constraints. Despite only evaluating the type I error rate for a finite parameter set, our approach guarantees type I error control over the full parameter space. Our results show that the test maximizing average power exhibits remarkable robustness, often showing highest power among comparators while maintaining exact type I error control. The method can be further tailored to prior beliefs by using a weighted average. The findings highlight both the method's practical utility and how techniques from combinatorial optimization can improve statistical methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to algorithm's stagnation.</p></details> |  |

While large-scale quantum computations are currently still out of reach, we can already numerically test such QUBO formulations on a perhaps surprisingly large scale. In this work, we benchmark Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, which captures the main complexity of the QUBO problem. We make a comprehensive benchmark against leading other heuristic algorithms on graphs with up to 53,000 variables by focusing on the wall-clock time. Moreover, we compare the DA performance against published performance results of the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical annealer and the recently proposed QIS3 heuristic. Based on performance statistics for over 2,000 graphs from the MQLib, we find that the DA yields competitive results. We hope that this benchmark demonstrates the extent to which large QUBO instances can be heuristically solved today, yielding consistent results across different solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 + ...</summary><p>24 + 14 pages, 12 figures.

SLA violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms. As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters, learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and SHAP-based interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, we present the Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Chromatic Number and Treewidth problems on, so-called, continuous or metric graphs where every edge is represented by a unit-length continuous interval rather than by a pair of vertices. If any point of any unit-interval edge is considered as a possible member of a hitting set or a cover, the classical combinatorial problems become trickier and many open questions arise. Notably, in many real-life applications, such a continuous view of a graph is more natural than the classic combinatorial definition of a graph. The contribution of this paper is twofold: i) we survey the known results for optimization problems on continuous graphs, and ii) we create a list of open problems related to the continuous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Memetic Algorithm for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21740v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs (CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process, significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these solvers focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers), when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a compelling and scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms applied to 3D spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT). We benchmark these methods against the performance of a leading quantum annealer on the same problem instances. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, in line with expectations from extreme value theory. We then show that APT, when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, exhibits a more favorable scaling and ultimately outperforms DT-SQA. We demonstrate these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware, projecting that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a new, rigorous classical baseline, clarifying the landscape for assessing a practical quantum advantage and presenting p-computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are openly available at https://github.com/OPUSLab/3DSpinGlassWithPbits.git</p></details> |

In particular, the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials, while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing the tuning process for CIMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Min Max Average Cycle Weight Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20253v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When an old apartment building is demolished and rebuilt, how can we fairly redistribute the new apartments to minimize envy among residents? We reduce this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max Average Cycle Weight* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>A not...</summary><p>A note presenting an open question</p></details> |
| **[RIS Codebook Index Assignment under Imperfect Control Links Using TSP-Inspired Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18727v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) promise transformative gains in wireless communications by enabling programmable control of the propagation environment through discrete phase configurations. In practical deployments, the control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks, with configuration indices transmitted over low latency, yet imperfect, wireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to significant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading system performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook index assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem, equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are "cities" and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion. A novel three-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this, consisting of a provision phase, a shotgun phase, and a fuzzy concatenation phase. Simulation results show that the method outperforms conventional indexing strategies and achieves near-optimal robustness to index errors, while also being scalable and hardwareagnostic for real time deployment. Future work includes multiple bits error correction and online adaptive mapping for time varying channels.</p></details> | RIS codebook |
| **[Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Collaborative Framework Integrating Large Language Model and Chemical Fragment Space: Mutual Inspiration for Lead Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13580v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Combinatorial Optimization with Graphical Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16031v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing work in online stochastic combinatorial optimization assumes that inputs are drawn from independent distributions -- a strong assumption that often fails in practice. At the other extreme, arbitrary correlations are equivalent to worst-case inputs via Yao's minimax principle, making good algorithms often impossible. This motivates the study of intermediate models that capture mild correlations while still permitting non-trivial algorithms. In this paper, we study online combinatorial optimization under Markov Random Fields (MRFs), a well-established graphical model for structured dependencies. MRFs parameterize correlation strength via the maximum weighted degree $\Delta$, smoothly interpolating between independence ($\Delta = 0$) and full correlation ($\Delta \to \infty$). While na\"ively this yields $e^{O(\Delta)}$-competitive algorithms and $\Omega(\Delta)$ hardness, we ask: when can we design tight $\Theta(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms? We present general techniques achieving $O(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms for both minimization and maximization problems under MRF-distributed inputs. For minimization problems with coverage constraints (e.g., Facility Location and Steiner Tree), we reduce to the well-studied $p$-sample model. For maximization problems (e.g., matchings and combinatorial auctions with XOS buyers), we extend the "balanced prices" framework for online allocation problems to MRFs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16004v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Design of Structured Variational Quantum Circuits with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16001v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153v5)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem. Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</p></details> |  |

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown significant benefits in solving CO problems, reducing reliance on domain expertise and improving computational efficiency. However, the absence of a unified benchmarking framework leads to inconsistent evaluations, limits reproducibility, and increases engineering overhead, raising barriers to adoption for new researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce RL4CO, a unified and extensive benchmark with in-depth library coverage of 27 CO problem environments and 23 state-of-the-art baselines. Built on efficient software libraries and best practices in implementation, RL4CO features modularized implementation and flexible configurations of diverse environments, policy architectures, RL algorithms, and utilities with extensive documentation. RL4CO helps researchers build on existing successes while exploring and developing their own designs, facilitating the entire research process by decoupling science from heavy engineering. We finally provide extensive benchmark studies to inspire new insights and future work. RL4CO has already attracted numerous researchers in the community and is open-sourced at https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Oral |
| **[A Large Language Model-Enhanced Q-learning for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06178v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.</p></details> |  |

We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Bias in Algorithmic Solutions: Exploring Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14509v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A typical goal of research in combinatorial optimization is to come up with fast algorithms that find optimal solutions to a computational problem. The process that takes a real-world problem and extracts a clean mathematical abstraction of it often throws out a lot of "side information" which is deemed irrelevant. However, the discarded information could be of real significance to the end-user of the algorithm's output. All solutions of the same cost are not necessarily of equal impact in the real-world; some solutions may be much more desirable than others, even at the expense of additional increase in cost. If the impact, positive or negative, is mostly felt by some specific (minority) subgroups of the population, the population at large will be largely unaware of it. In this work we ask the question of finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems that are "unbiased" with respect to a collection of specified subgroups of the total population.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has focused attention on formulating combinatorial optimization problems as quadratic polynomials. To improve the performance of solving large QUBO problems, it is essential to minimize the number of binary variables used in the objective function. In this paper, we propose a QUBO formulation that offers a bit capacity advantage over conventional quadratization techniques. As a key application, this formulation significantly reduces the number of binary variables required for score-based Bayesian network structure learning. Experimental results on $16$ instances, ranging from $37$ to $223$ variables, demonstrate that our approach requires notably fewer binary variables than quadratization. Moreover, an annealing machine that implement our formulation have outperformed existing algorithms in score maximization.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures, AAAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Hardware-Compatible Single-Shot Feasible-Space Heuristics for Solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09676v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research into the development of special-purpose computing architectures designed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems has flourished in recent years. It has been demonstrated in the literature that such special-purpose solvers can outperform traditional CMOS architectures by orders of magnitude with respect to timing metrics on synthetic problems. However, they face challenges with constrained problems such as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), where mapping to binary formulations such as QUBO introduces overhead and limits parallelism. In-memory computing (IMC) devices, such as memristor-based analog Ising machines, offer significant speedups and efficiency gains over traditional CPU-based solvers, particularly for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we present a novel local search heuristic designed for IMC hardware to tackle the QAP. Our approach enables massive parallelism that allows for computing of full neighbourhoods simultaneously to make update decisions. We ensure binary solutions remain feasible by selecting local moves that lead to neighbouring feasible solutions, leveraging feasible-space search heuristics and the underlying structure of a given problem. Our approach is compatible with both digital computers and analog hardware. We demonstrate its effectiveness in CPU implementations by comparing it with state-of-the-art heuristics for solving the QAP.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p></details> |  |

The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums. We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes. To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds. Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, includes full algorithmic framework and empirical validation.

This study benchmarks five software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to 45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time. Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption. PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU. SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality, scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources permit.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Metabolomics data are typically high-dimensional and contain highly correlated variables and frequent missing values. Both missing at random (MAR) data, due to acquisition or processing errors, and missing not at random (MNAR) data, caused by values falling below detection thresholds, are common. Thus, imputation is a critical component of downstream analysis. Existing imputation methods generally assume one type of data missingness mechanism, or impute values outside the data's physical constraints. A novel truncated Gaussian infinite factor analysis (TGIFA) model is proposed to perform statistically principled and physically realistic imputation in metabolomics data. By incorporating truncated Gaussian assumptions, TGIFA respects the data's physical constraints, while leveraging an infinite latent factor framework to capture high-dimensional dependencies without pre-specifying the number of latent factors. Our Bayesian inference approach enables uncertainty quantification in both the values of the imputed data, and the missing data mechanism. A computationally efficient exchange algorithm enables scalable posterior inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We validate TGIFA through a comprehensive simulation study and demonstrate its utility in a motivating urinary metabolomics dataset, where it yields useful imputations, with associated uncertainty quantification. Open-source R code, available at https://github.com/kfinucane/TGIFA, accompanies TGIFA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training neural control variates using correlated configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07719v4)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures; Version accepted by PRD</p></details> |
| **[Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain, and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations. A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task. On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Multiple outcomes of policy interest, including HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, and antiretroviral therapy treatment coverage are jointly modelled using both household survey data and routinely reported health system data. The model is provided as a tool for countries to input their data to and generate estimates with during a yearly process supported by UNAIDS. Previously, inference has been conducted using empirical Bayes and a Gaussian approximation, implemented via the TMB R package. We propose a new inference method based on an extension of adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to deal with more than 20 hyperparameters. Using data from Malawi, our method improves the accuracy of inferences for model parameters, while being substantially faster to run than Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the No-U-Turn sampler. Our implementation leverages the existing TMB C++ template for the model's log-posterior, and is compatible with any model with such a template.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis: A Novel Approach to Latent Variable Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15611v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factor score estimation in small sample sizes often encounters parameter bias and convergence failures when constructing hierarchical national/sub-national indices. This paper proposes a novel method for hierarchical factor analysis called "sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis". Instead of estimating multiple levels of factors at the same time, this approach calculates factor scores sequentially from the lowest to highest levels. This sequential estimation keeps the original sample size in each step and also removes cross-level covariance estimation. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we isolate the difference between sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis and traditional Confirmatory Factor Analysis by comparing their resulting factor scores to the true latent variables under varying conditions. We also estimate the WJP Rule of Law Index using traditional Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis to test performance. Our findings demonstrate that sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis significantly outperforms the traditional model for indices with simple/moderate complexity. Traditional Confirmatory Factor Analysis performs better where the data are skewed. Where the hierarchical model becomes complex, the two methods perform similarly. Finally, sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis can provide valid estimates where traditional or Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis fail to converge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clustering-based aggregate value regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15567v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various practical situations, forecasting of aggregate values rather than individual ones is often our main focus. For instance, electricity companies are interested in forecasting the total electricity demand in a specific region to ensure reliable grid operation and resource allocation. However, to our knowledge, statistical learning specifically for forecasting aggregate values has not yet been well-established. In particular, the relationship between forecast error and the number of clusters has not been well studied, as clustering is usually treated as unsupervised learning. This study introduces a novel forecasting method specifically focused on the aggregate values in the linear regression model. We call it the Aggregate Value Regression (AVR), and it is constructed by combining all regression models into a single model. With the AVR, we must estimate a huge number of parameters when the number of regression models to be combined is large, resulting in overparameterization. To address the overparameterization issue, we introduce a hierarchical clustering technique, referred to as AVR-C (C stands for clustering). In this approach, several clusters of regression models are constructed, and the AVR is performed within each cluster. The AVR-C introduces a novel bias-variance trade-off theory under the assumption of a misspecified model. In this framework, the number of clusters characterizes model complexity. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to investigate the behavior of training and test errors of our proposed clustering technique. The bias-variance trade-off theory is also demonstrated through the analysis of electricity demand forecasting.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |
| **[K-Means Panel Data Clustering in the Presence of Small Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15408v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider panel data models with group structure. We study the asymptotic behavior of least-squares estimators and information criterion for the number of groups, allowing for the presence of small groups that have an asymptotically negligible relative size. Our contributions are threefold. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the least-squares estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. One of the conditions implies that a longer sample period is required as there are smaller groups. Second, we show that information criteria for the number of groups proposed in earlier works can be inconsistent or perform poorly in the presence of small groups. Third, we propose modified information criteria (MIC) designed to perform well in the presence of small groups. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms their good performance in finite samples. An empirical application illustrates that K-means clustering paired with the proposed MIC allows one to discover small groups without producing too many groups. This enables characterizing small groups and differentiating them from the other large groups in a parsimonious group structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo: fast uncertainty estimation beyond deep ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13585v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new method designed for Bayesian deep learning called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo (SBMC). The method is comprised of a model and an algorithm. The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior. The algorithm is a parallel implementation of sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC$_\parallel$) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC$_\parallel$). We collectively refer to these consistent (asymptotically unbiased) algorithms as Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC), and any such algorithm can be used in our SBMC method. The utility of the method is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic numerical study reveals that for the same wall-clock time as state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like deep ensembles (DE), SBMC achieves comparable or better accuracy and substantially improved uncertainty quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. This is demonstrated on the downstream task of estimating the confidence in predictions, which can be used for reliability assessment or abstention decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 30 figures, 23 tables</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05908v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a reverse diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locally Pareto-Optimal Interpretations for Black-Box Machine Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15220v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem, which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at ATVA'25</p></details> |

Simple models require minimal adjustments but come with strong assumptions, while more flexible models require significant input and tuning from researchers. We present a survival model using a Bayesian hierarchical shrinkage method that automatically determines whether each covariate should be treated as static, time-varying, or excluded altogether. This approach strikes a balance between simplicity and flexibility, minimizes the need for tuning, and naturally quantifies uncertainty. The method is supported by an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, implemented in the R package shrinkDSM. Comprehensive simulation studies and an application to a clinical dataset involving patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction showcase the advantages of our approach compared to existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework: MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff, based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics. Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and efficiency, without the need for learned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes Error Rate Estimation in Difficult Situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03159v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |
| **[TOAST: Fast and scalable auto-partitioning based on principled static analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15010v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently, existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space, but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance. We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii) partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution. Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even for complex and large models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

Traditional gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Dynamic Risk-Aware MPPI for Mobile Robots in Crowds via Efficient Monte Carlo Approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21205v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

| **[Exact $\ell^\infty$-separation radius of Sobol' sequences in dimension 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14803v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasi-uniformity is a fundamental geometric property of point sets, crucial for applications such as kernel interpolation, Gaussian process regression, and space-filling experimental designs. While quasi-Monte Carlo methods are widely recognized for their low-discrepancy characteristics, understanding their quasi-uniformity remains important for practical applications. For the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence, Sobol' and Shukhman (2007) conjectured that the separation radius of the first $N$ points achieves the optimal rate $N^{-1/2}$, which would imply quasi-uniformity. This conjecture was disproved by Goda (2024), who computed exact values of the $\ell^2$-separation radius for a sparse subsequence $N = 2^{2^v-1}$. However, the general behavior of the Sobol' sequence for arbitrary $N$ remained unclear. In this paper, we derive exact expressions for the $\ell^\infty$-separation radius of the first $N = 2^m$ points of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. As an immediate consequence, we show that the separation radius of Sobol' points is $O(N^{-3/4})$, which is strictly worse than the optimal rate $N^{-1/2}$, revealing that the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence has a suboptimal mesh ratio that grows at least as $N^{1/4}$.</p></details> |  |

By representing the robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency. The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its application in a variety of real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

We provide a proof of convergence for SMC$_\parallel$ showing that it theoretically achieves the same level of convergence as a single monolithic SMC sampler, while the reduced communication lowers wall-clock time. It is well-known that the first samples from MCMC need to be discarded to eliminate initialization bias, and that the number of discarded samples must grow like the logarithm of the number of parallel chains to control that bias for MCMC$_\parallel$. A systematic empirical numerical study on MNIST, CIFAR, and IMDb, reveals that parallel implementations of both methods perform comparably to non-parallel implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and also comparably to each other. However, both methods still require a large wall-clock time, and suffer from catastrophic non-convergence if they aren't run for long enough.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 16 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[GOGS: High-Fidelity Geometry and Relighting for Glossy Objects via Gaussian Surfels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14563v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties, leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models. Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

Approaches such as bridge sampling, while effective, may suffer from issues of high variability of the estimates. We present how to estimate Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) for bridge sampling, and how to diagnose the reliability of MCSE estimates using Pareto-$\hat{k}$ and block reshuffling diagnostics without the need to repeatedly re-run full posterior inference. We demonstrate the behavior with increasingly more difficult simulated posteriors and many real posteriors from the posteriordb database.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The study's novelty is that the transaction costs are integrated within the optimization problem in a high-dimensional portfolio setting where the number of assets is larger than the sample size. We propose portfolio construction and rebalancing models with nonconvex penalty considering two types of transaction cost, the proportional transaction cost and the quadratic transaction cost. We establish the desired theoretical properties under mild regularity conditions. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical studies using S&P 500 and Russell 2000 stocks show the satisfactory performance of the proposed portfolio and highlight the importance of involving the transaction costs when rebalancing a portfolio.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies of gender effects on complications after CABG surgery have consistently revealed that women tend to suffer worse outcomes. To better understand the causal pathway from gender to the number of rehospitalisations, we study the postoperative central venous pressure (CVP), recorded over the first 24 hours of patients' intensive care unit (ICU) stay after the CABG surgery, as sparse observations of a functional mediator. Confronted with time-varying CVP measurements and zero-inflated rehospitalisation counts within 60 days following discharge, we propose a parameter-simulating quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo approximation method that accommodates a sparse functional mediator and a zero-inflated count outcome for causal mediation analysis. We find a causal relationship between the female gender and increased rehospitalisation counts after CABG, and that time-varying central venous pressure mediates this causal effect.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version and re-submitted to Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C: Applied Statistics</p></details> |

We adapt the recursive relationship of WoS designed for PDEs in volumetric domains to a volumetric neighborhood around the surface, and at the end of each recursion step, we project the sample point on the sphere back to the surface. We motivate this simple modification to WoS with the theory of the closest point extension used in the closest point method. To define the valid volumetric neighborhood domain for PWoS, we develop strategies to estimate the local feature size of the surface and to compute the distance to the Dirichlet boundaries on the surface extended in their normal directions. We also design a mean value filtering method for PWoS to improve the method's efficiency when the surface is represented as a polygonal mesh or a point cloud. Finally, we study the convergence of PWoS and demonstrate its application to graphics tasks, including diffusion curves, geodesic distance computation, and wave propagation animation.

| **[The Spectral Barycentre of a Set of Graphs with Community Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of barycentre graph is of crucial importance for machine learning algorithms that process graph-valued data. The barycentre graph is a "summary graph" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training dataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of a metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a multiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of the normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the optimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a structural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of the barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the topological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can be computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases. When the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model, then our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the limit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our approach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models.</p></details> | 28 pages |

The algorithm presented in this paper, termed regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an estimator of the matrix inverse via ratios of unbiased estimators of the regenerative quantities. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of simulated Markov transitions, thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and their length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative variables, the proposed algorithm automatically quantifies the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</p></details> |  |

Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, ICCV 2025 Findings Oral, Project pages: https://jzr99.github.io/DNF-Avatar/</p></details> |

OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Traceplot Thickens: Developing All-Purpose Convergence Diagnostics for any Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15392v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are frequently used to perform inference under a Bayesian modeling framework. Convergence diagnostics, such as traceplots, the Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor, and effective sample size, are used to visualize and monitor how well the sampler has explored the parameter space and the mixing of multiple chains. However, these classic diagnostics can be undefined or ineffective when the sample space of the algorithm varies in dimension or has a large number of discrete parameters. In this article, we develop a novel approach to produce convergence diagnostics in these difficult scenarios by mapping the original sample space to the real-line and then evaluating the convergence diagnostics on the mapped values. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a MCMC algorithm sampling from a Dirichlet process mixture model. The proposed diagnostics are also used to evaluate the performance of a Bayesian kernel machine regression model for estimating the health effect of multi-pollutant mixtures in the Study of Environment, Lifestyle, and Fibroids. Based on diagnostics for the latter dataset, we then explain how we modify the MCMC sampler to improve convergence.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks.

| **[ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Structural Phenotypes with Functional Data for Early Prediction of Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma Progression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14922v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline <-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Online Stochastic Packing with General Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13458v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in studying online stochastic packing under more general correlation structures, motivated by the complex data sets and models driving modern applications. Several past works either assume correlations are weak or have a particular structure, have a complexity scaling with the number of Markovian "states of the world" (which may be exponentially large e.g. in the case of full history dependence), scale poorly with the horizon $T$, or make additional continuity assumptions. Surprisingly, we show that for all $\epsilon$, the online stochastic packing linear programming problem with general correlations (suitably normalized and with sparse columns) has an approximately optimal policy (with optimality gap $\epsilon T$) whose per-decision runtime scales as the time to simulate a single sample path of the underlying stochastic process (assuming access to a Monte Carlo simulator), multiplied by a constant independent of the horizon or number of Markovian states. We derive analogous results for network revenue management, and online bipartite matching and independent set in bounded-degree graphs, by rounding. Our algorithms implement stochastic gradient methods in a novel on-the-fly/recursive manner for the associated massive deterministic-equivalent linear program on the corresponding probability space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Bayesian Computation sequential Monte Carlo via random forests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15865v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a popular inference method when likelihoods are hard to come by. Practical bottlenecks of ABC applications include selecting statistics that summarize the data without losing too much information or introducing uncertainty, and choosing distance functions and tolerance thresholds that balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Recent studies have shown that ABC methods using random forest (RF) methodology perform well while circumventing many of ABC's drawbacks. However, RF construction is computationally expensive for large numbers of trees and model simulations, and there can be high uncertainty in the posterior if the prior distribution is uninformative. Here we further adapt random forests to the ABC setting in two ways. The first exploits distributional random forests to provide a direct method for inferring the joint posterior distribution of parameters of interest, while the second describes a sequential Monte Carlo approach which updates the prior distribution iteratively to focus on the most likely regions in the parameter space. We show that the new methods can accurately infer posterior distributions for a wide range of deterministic and stochastic models in different scientific areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[Monte Carlo Functional Regularisation for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13006v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods. Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Contact Sequence and Patch Planning for Dynamic Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12928v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots have the potential to traverse highly constrained environments with agile maneuvers. However, planning such motions requires solving a highly challenging optimization problem with a mixture of continuous and discrete decision variables. In this paper, we present a full pipeline based on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and whole-body trajectory optimization (TO) to perform simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection on highly challenging environments. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that our framework can quickly find a diverse set of dynamically consistent plans. We experimentally show that these plans are transferable to a real quadruped robot. We further show that the same framework can find highly complex acyclic humanoid maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection for acyclic multi-contact locomotion using the whole-body dynamics of a quadruped.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseMap: A Sparse Tensor Accelerator Framework Based on Evolution Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12906v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators. However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However, integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times 64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds superior solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of three random field sampling methods for high-resolution Bayesian inversion with application to a plane stress problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12876v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inversion aims to provide uncertainty quantification of posterior estimates conditional on observations. When the inferred parameter is a continuous spatial function, one common strategy is to model it as a random field. Several random field sampling strategies exist. In this article, we investigate three different approaches in terms of numerical efficiency and influence on the posterior distribution. These approaches are based on (i) Karhunen-Loeve and (ii) wavelet expansions, and (iii) local average subdivision. We use the multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to construct posterior estimates with all approaches. This enables a focus on high-dimensional problems discretised on high-resolution finite element grids. As an application, we consider the reconstruction of material parameters in a 2D plane stress model, conditional on static displacement observations. Through these numerical experiments, we deduce that the methods provide comparable posterior estimates and that the local average subdivision method attains slightly better numerical efficiency than the other two approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[An Introduction to Sliced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12519v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.</p></details> | 227 pages |

However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs. For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or research interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff in Inference-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12361v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models, yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately, whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Error Probability Estimation of Nano-scale Combinational Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12345v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As technology scales, nano-scale digital circuits face heightened susceptibility to single event upsets (SEUs) and transients (SETs) due to shrinking feature sizes and reduced operating voltages. While logical, electrical, and timing masking effects influence soft error probability (SEP), the combined impact of process variation (PV) and aging-induced degradation further complicates SEP estimation. Existing approaches often address PV or aging in isolation, or rely on computationally intensive methods like Monte Carlo simulations, limiting their practicality for large-scale circuit optimization. This paper introduces a novel framework for SEP analysis that holistically integrates PV and aging effects. We propose an enhanced electrical masking model and a statistical methodology to quantify soft error probability under process and aging variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy while reducing computational overhead by approximately 2.5% compared to Monte Carlo-based methods. This work advances the design of reliable nano-scale circuits by enabling efficient, accurate SEP estimation in the presence of manufacturing variability and long-term transistor degradation.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Stochastic Orienteering Problems with Chance Constraints Using a GNN Powered Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04653v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the power of a graph neural network (GNN) with message passing, we present a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method to solve stochastic orienteering problems with chance constraints. While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

This equivalence enables a unified route to closed-form point estimators for multi-parameter models that typically lack explicit maximum likelihood (ML) solutions. Within this framework we (i) recover, as special cases, several recent closed-form estimators from the literature; (ii) derive new families of estimators indexed by monotone transformations $g$; and (iii) establish strong consistency and asymptotic normality under mild regularity, including a dominated differentiation condition. As a detailed illustration, we derive closed-form estimators for parameters that index the beta distribution. A Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of proposed and existing estimators. Finally, we illustrate the approach with a novel municipal data set regarding proportions of land used for farming in Roraima (Brazil), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in the literature before, demonstrating the method's practical usefulness.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

In such combined datasets, bilateral outcomes exhibit intra-subject correlation, while unilateral outcomes are assumed independent. We investigate the generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach for testing homogeneity of proportions across multiple groups for the combined unilateral and bilateral data, and compare it with three likelihood-based statistics (likelihood ratio, Wald-type, and score) under Rosner's constant $R$ model and Donner's equal correlation $\rho$ model. Monte Carlo simulations evaluate empirical type I error and power under varied sample sizes and parameter settings. The GEE and score tests show superior type I error control, outperforming likelihood ratio and Wald-type tests. Applications to two real datasets in otolaryngologic and ophthalmologic studies illustrate the methods. We recommend the GEE and score tests for homogeneity testing, and suggest GEE for more complex models with covariates, while favoring the score statistic for small sample exact tests due to its computational efficiency.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 tables |

This class of PDMPs adapts the concept of a mirror map from convex optimisation to address sampling problems. Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

| **[Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

| **[Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CONCORD: Concept-Informed Diffusion for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18358v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in https://github.com/vimar-gu/CONCORD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling for Bimanual Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13667v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-arm manipulation requires satisfying multiple simultaneous geometric constraints across high-dimensional configuration spaces, which poses a significant challenge for traditional planning and control methods. In this work, we propose Adaptive Diffusion Constrained Sampling (ADCS), a generative framework that flexibly integrates both equality (e.g., relative and absolute pose constraints) and structured inequality constraints (e.g., proximity to object surfaces) into an energy-based diffusion model. Equality constraints are modeled using dedicated energy networks trained on pose differences in Lie algebra space, while inequality constraints are represented via Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and encoded into learned constraint embeddings, allowing the model to reason about complex spatial regions. A key innovation of our method is a Transformer-based architecture that learns to weight constraint-specific energy functions at inference time, enabling flexible and context-aware constraint integration. Moreover, we adopt a two-phase sampling strategy that improves precision and sample diversity by combining Langevin dynamics with resampling and density-aware re-weighting. Experimental results on dual-arm manipulation tasks show that ADCS significantly improves sample diversity and generalization across settings demanding precise coordination and adaptive constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The adaptive complexity of parallelized log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13045v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-data applications, such as the inference process of diffusion models, it is desirable to design sampling algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of sampling, which is the minimum number of sequential rounds required to achieve sampling given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round. For unconstrained sampling, we examine distributions that are log-smooth or log-Lipschitz and log strongly or non-strongly concave. We show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with a specific exponentially small error under total variation distance. For box-constrained sampling, we show that an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot return a sample with sup-polynomially small error under total variation distance for log-concave distributions. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on the chain-like structure with random partition and classical smoothing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |

We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the R package CDsampling, which is the first to our knowledge to integrate optimal design theories within the framework of constrained sampling. This package offers the possibility to find both D-optimal approximate and exact allocations for samplings with or without constraints. Additionally, it provides functions to find constrained uniform sampling as a robust sampling strategy when the model information is limited. To demonstrate its efficacy, we provide simulated examples and a real-data example with datasets embedded in the package and compare them with classical sampling methods. Furthermore, the package revisits the theoretical results of the Fisher information matrix for generalized linear models (including regular linear regression model) and multinomial logistic models, offering functions for its computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17677v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition, we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper, we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace, constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus, the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced, alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features, we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-label feature selection based on binary hashing learning and dynamic graph constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13874v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable supervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ continuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory information representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from irrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method called Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to integrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes low-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection space is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary pseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further enhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and inner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an $l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to facilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG outperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG achieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best method by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.</p></details> | 21 pages,19 figures |

Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>feedb...</summary><p>feedback welcome, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures. Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23170v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready (30 pages, 26 figures)</p></details> |

However, current CSS approaches encounter challenges in the trade-off between preserving old knowledge and learning new ones, where they still need large-scale annotated data for incremental training and lack interpretability. In this paper, we present Learning at a Glance (LAG), an efficient, robust, human-like and interpretable approach for CSS. Specifically, LAG is a simple and model-agnostic architecture, yet it achieves competitive CSS efficiency with limited incremental data. Inspired by human-like recognition patterns, we propose a semantic-invariance modelling approach via semantic features decoupling that simultaneously reconciles solid knowledge inheritance and new-term learning. Concretely, the proposed decoupling manner includes two ways, i.e., channel-wise decoupling and spatial-level neuron-relevant semantic consistency. Our approach preserves semantic-invariant knowledge as solid prototypes to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while also constraining sample-specific contents through an asymmetric contrastive learning method to enhance model robustness during IL steps. Experimental results in multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel CSS protocol that better reflects realistic data-limited CSS settings, and LAG achieves superior performance under multiple data-limited conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases. By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</p></details> | Under submission |

This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients are available, we get $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in the TV distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve the result to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling that handle non-convex $f$ and provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods with deterministic gradient. If unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradient of $f$ are available, we propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that can handle stochastic gradients and are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps. For PSGLD and PSGULMC, when $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ iteration complexity in W2 distance. When $f$ is smooth and can be non-convex, we provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration complexity results. Finally, we illustrate the performance on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages coin betting ideas from convex optimisation, and the viewpoint of constrained sampling as a mirrored optimisation problem on the space of probability measures. Based on this viewpoint, we also introduce a unifying framework for several existing constrained sampling algorithms, including mirrored Langevin dynamics and mirrored Stein variational gradient descent. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on a range of numerical examples, including sampling from targets on the simplex, sampling with fairness constraints, and constrained sampling problems in post-selection inference. Our results indicate that our algorithms achieve competitive performance with existing constrained sampling methods, without the need to tune any hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Stitched ViTs are Flexible Vision Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00154v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have been the workhorse for many downstream tasks. However, existing works utilizing off-the-shelf ViTs are inefficient in terms of training and deployment, because adopting ViTs with individual sizes requires separate trainings and is restricted by fixed performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we are inspired by stitchable neural networks (SN-Net), which is a new framework that cheaply produces a single model that covers rich subnetworks by stitching pretrained model families, supporting diverse performance-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Building upon this foundation, we introduce SN-Netv2, a systematically improved model stitching framework to facilitate downstream task adaptation. Specifically, we first propose a two-way stitching scheme to enlarge the stitching space. We then design a resource-constrained sampling strategy that takes into account the underlying FLOPs distributions in the space for better sampling. Finally, we observe that learning stitching layers as a low-rank update plays an essential role on downstream tasks to stabilize training and ensure a good Pareto frontier. With extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and NYUv2, SN-Netv2 demonstrates superior performance over SN-Netv1 on downstream dense predictions and shows strong ability as a flexible vision backbone, achieving great advantages in both training efficiency and deployment flexibility.

| **[Unbiased constrained sampling with Self-Concordant Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11925v3)** | 2023-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining $\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose a new filter step, called "involution checking step", to address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-aware Real-time Tracking and Remote Reconstruction of a Markov Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11950v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of real-time remote tracking and reconstruction of a two-state Markov process is considered here. A transmitter sends samples from an observed information source to a remote monitor over an unreliable wireless channel. The receiver, in turn, performs an action according to the state of the reconstructed source. We propose a state-aware randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy which accounts for the importance of different states of the information source, and their impact on the goal of the communication process. We then analyze the performance of the proposed policy, and compare it with existing goal-oriented joint sampling and transmission policies, with respect to a set of performance metrics. Specifically, we study the real-time reconstruction error, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and a new metric, coined importance-aware consecutive error. In addition, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that aims to obtain the optimal sampling probabilities that minimize the average cost of actuation error. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal state-aware randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies for fast evolving sources, and, under certain conditions, for slowly varying sources. Otherwise, a semantics-aware policy performs better only when the source is slowly varying.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.13927</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel derivative-free global optimization technique that can be used to solve those problems even when the objective function is not known explicitly or its derivatives are difficult or expensive to obtain. The technique is based on the pattern search algorithm, which has been shown to be effective for black-box optimization problems. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively generating new solutions from the current solution. The new solutions are generated by making movements along the coordinate axes of the constrained sample space. Before making a jump from the current solution to a new solution, the objective function is evaluated at several neighborhood points around the current solution. The best solution point is then chosen based on the objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by optimizing up to 5000-dimensional multi-modal benchmark functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be up to 40 and 368 times faster than genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), respectively. The proposed method is also used to estimate the optimal biomarker combination from Alzheimer's disease data by maximizing the empirical estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), outperforming the contextual popular alternative, known as step-down algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1)** | 2023-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICCV2023.

However, applying diffusion to discrete categorical data remains a non-trivial task. Moreover, generation in continuous domains often requires clipping in practice, which motivates the need for a theoretical framework for adapting diffusion to constrained domains. Inspired by the mirror Langevin algorithm for the constrained sampling problem, in this theoretical report we propose Mirror Diffusion Models (MDMs). We demonstrate MDMs in the context of simplex diffusion and propose natural extensions to popular domains such as image and text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10506v5)** | 2023-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.</p></details> |  |

Such representation has several key advantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal distribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the simple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss training objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors. Third, our model is capable of learning the joint distribution for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-invariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed trajectory representation via PCA, which improves model performance and allows for efficient computation of the exact sample log probability. Subsequently, we propose a general constrained sampling framework that enables controlled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost functions. This strategy enables a host of applications such as enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tailored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be combined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top motion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art results for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a highlight paper in CVPR 2023.

| **[Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13400v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  |

A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an $N$-state Markov chain and an $N$-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance with respect to a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a \emph{wait-then-generate} sampling policy which is simple to implement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.01132</p></details> |

In this work, we study constrained sampling from such language models: generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints, while maintaining fluency and the model's performance in a downstream task. We propose MuCoLa -- a sampling procedure that combines the log-likelihood of the language model with arbitrary (differentiable) constraints in a single energy function, and then generates samples in a non-autoregressive manner. Specifically, it initializes the entire output sequence with noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin Dynamics using the gradients of the energy function. We evaluate MuCoLa on text generation with soft and hard constraints as well as their combinations obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines for toxicity avoidance, sentiment control, and keyword-guided generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling Constrained Continuous Probability Distributions: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12403v1)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling constrained continuous distributions has frequently appeared in many machine/statistical learning models. Many Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods have been adapted to handle different types of constraints on the random variables. Among these methods, Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and the related approaches have shown significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to other counterparts. In this article, we first review HMC and some extended sampling methods, and then we concretely explain three constrained HMC-based sampling methods, reflection, reformulation, and spherical HMC. For illustration, we apply these methods to solve three well-known constrained sampling problems, truncated multivariate normal distributions, Bayesian regularized regression, and nonparametric density estimation. In this review, we also connect constrained sampling with another similar problem in the statistical design of experiments of constrained design space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Sampling for Class-Agnostic Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09195v1)** | 2022-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised vision transformers can generate accurate localization maps of the objects in an image. However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new discriminative proposals sampling method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB benchmark dataset indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. Our method provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work in the exact and $\varepsilon$-strong simulation of diffusions, which can be used to almost surely constrain sample paths to a given tolerance, suggests one way to do this. We specify how such algorithms can be combined with the classical multilevel splitting method for rare event simulation. This provides unbiased estimations of the probability in question. We discuss the practical feasibility of the algorithm with reference to existing $\varepsilon$-strong methods and provide proof-of-concept numerical examples.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Our analysis uses relative convexity/smoothness and self-concordance, ideas which originated in convex optimization, together with a new result in optimal transport that generalizes the displacement convexity of the entropy. Unlike prior works, our result both (1) requires much weaker assumptions on the mirror map and the target distribution, and (2) has vanishing bias as the step size tends to zero. In particular, for the task of sampling from a log-concave distribution supported on a compact set, our theoretical results are significantly better than the existing guarantees.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to build a single multilingual translation system with a hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. We extend the exploration of different back-translation methods from bilingual translation to multilingual translation. Better performance is obtained by the constrained sampling method, which is different from the finding of the bilingual translation. Besides, we also explore the effect of vocabularies and the amount of synthetic data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of vocabularies perform better, and the extensive monolingual English data offers a modest improvement. We submitted to both the small tasks and achieved the second place.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Sparse Sensing (Part I): Necessary and Sufficient Sampling Theory and Robust Remaindering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10423v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the first part of the series papers, we set out to answer the following question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity (compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of sampling implementation itself. The "sparse" here is referred to sampling at a low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition), which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and throughput. We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some (multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention over last decade. On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms, once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.</p></details> |  |

However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constrained Sampling from a Kernel Density Estimator to Generate Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05278v1)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf, because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters. Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the literature, as far as the authors know. In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures.

For each problem, we propose a privacy preserving algorithm using stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques, and show that it can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. To the best of our knowledge, SSCA has not been used for solving federated optimization, and federated optimization with nonconvex constraints has not been investigated. Next, we customize the two proposed SSCA-based algorithms to two application examples, and provide closed-form solutions for the respective approximate convex problems at each iteration of SSCA. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate inherent advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed, communication cost and model specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICC 2021</p></details> |
| **[Projected Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling and Non-Convex Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12137v1)** | 2020-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Langevin algorithms are gradient descent methods with additive noise. They have been used for decades in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and learning. Their convergence properties for unconstrained non-convex optimization and learning problems have been studied widely in the last few years. Other work has examined projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from log-concave distributions restricted to convex compact sets. For learning and optimization, log-concave distributions correspond to convex losses. In this paper, we analyze the case of non-convex losses with compact convex constraint sets and IID external data variables. We term the resulting method the projected stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4}(\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. For optimization and learning, we show that the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a time that is polynomial in $\epsilon^{-1}$ and slightly super-exponential in the problem dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

| **[Learning Equality Constraints for Motion Planning on Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11852v1)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06311v3)** | 2020-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic execution and fuzzing are two complementary coverage-based testing techniques. How to achieve the best of both remains an open challenge. To address this research problem, we propose and evaluate Legion. Legion re-engineers the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework from the AI literature to treat automated test generation as a problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Its best-first search strategy provides a principled way to learn the most promising program states to investigate at each search iteration, based on observed rewards from previous iterations. Legion incorporates a form of directed fuzzing that we call approximate path-preserving fuzzing (APPFuzzing) to investigate program states selected by MCTS. APPFuzzing serves as the Monte Carlo simulation technique and is implemented by extending prior work on constrained sampling. We evaluate Legion against competitors on 2531 benchmarks from the coverage category of Test-Comp 2020, as well as measuring its sensitivity to hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide variety of input programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Algorithms, 3 Figures, 2 Tables, ASE2020</p></details> |
| **[Double-Loop Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01147v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06922v1)** | 2020-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, and 8 figures.

| **[Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling of the Wiener Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01317v3)** | 2020-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Average-Compress Algorithm for the Sample Mean Problem under Dynamic Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13541v2)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing a sample mean of time series under dynamic time warping (DTW) is NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast, research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be used. Experimental results show that the AC algorithm substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for time series averaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimensionality compression and expansion in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00443v3)** | 2019-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datasets such as images, text, or movies are embedded in high-dimensional spaces. However, in important cases such as images of objects, the statistical structure in the data constrains samples to a manifold of dramatically lower dimensionality. Learning to identify and extract task-relevant variables from this embedded manifold is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional problems. We find that neural networks are often very effective at solving this task and investigate why. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art techniques for intrinsic dimensionality estimation to show that neural networks learn low-dimensional manifolds in two phases: first, dimensionality expansion driven by feature generation in initial layers, and second, dimensionality compression driven by the selection of task-relevant features in later layers. We model noise generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent and show how this noise balances the dimensionality of neural representations by inducing an effective regularization term in the loss. We highlight the important relationship between low-dimensional compressed representations and generalization properties of the network. Our work contributes by shedding light on the success of deep neural networks in disentangling data in high-dimensional space while achieving good generalization. Furthermore, it invites new learning strategies focused on optimizing measurable geometric properties of learned representations, beginning with their intrinsic dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2019.

Our conversation model is a standard matching based information retrieval architecture, which consists of two parallel encoders to project messages and replies into a common feature representation. During inference, we select replies from a fixed response set using nearest neighbors in the feature space. To diversify responses, we formulate the model as a generative latent variable model with Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (M-CVAE). We propose a constrained-sampling approach to make the variational inference in M-CVAE efficient for our production system. In offline experiments, M-CVAE consistently increased diversity by ~30-40% without significant impact on relevance. This translated to a 5% gain in click-rate in our online production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02348v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Counting and Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02239v1)** | 2018-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

Conditional generators are one of the successful implementations of such models wherein the created samples are constrained to a specific class.

A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Complexity of Constrained Determinantal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00554v3)** | 2017-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature. The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials. Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greed is Good: Near-Optimal Submodular Maximization via Greedy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01652v1)** | 2017-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible constrained sampling with guarantees for pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09263v2)** | 2017-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern sampling has been proposed as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: 1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel pattern set sampling task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and 2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery journal (ECML/PKDD 2017 journal track)</p></details> |

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The present version subsumes arXiv:1607.03559</p></details> |

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features and deep-learned features. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets (HMDB51 65.9%, UCF101 91.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015</p></details> |

This is the case e.g. with strictly positive data and with compositional data, like percentages and the like. If the natural measure of difference is not the absolute one, it is possible to use simple algebraic properties to show that it is more convenient to work with a geometry that is not the usual Euclidean geometry in real space, and with a measure which is not the usual Lebesgue measure, leading to alternative models which better fit the phenomenon under study. The general approach is presented and illustrated both on the positive real line and on the D-part simplex.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Time-Series Causal Discovery with Approximate Causal Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series data presents a significant computational challenge. Standard algorithms are often prohibitively expensive for datasets with many variables or samples. This study introduces and validates a heuristic approximation of the VarLiNGAM algorithm to address this scalability problem. The standard VarLiNGAM method relies on an iterative search, recalculating statistical dependencies after each step. Our heuristic modifies this procedure by omitting the iterative refinement. This change permits a one-time precomputation of all necessary statistical values. The algorithmic modification reduces the time complexity from $O(m^3n)$ to $O(m^2n + m^3)$ while keeping the space complexity at $O(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number of samples. While an approximation, our approach retains VarLiNGAM's essential structure and empirical reliability. On large-scale financial data with up to 400 variables, our algorithm achieves a 7--13x speedup over the standard implementation and a 4.5x speedup over a GPU-accelerated version. Evaluations across medical imaging, web server monitoring, and finance demonstrate the heuristic's robustness and practical scalability. This work offers a validated balance between computational efficiency and discovery quality, making large-scale causal analysis feasible on personal computers.</p></details> |  |

By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Powered Machine Learning Approaches for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Pumps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15550v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied, combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the 95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts. Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive maintenance in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |

They include tasks such as summation or finding the median among the items of the same group, and within a specified number of the last observed tuples for sliding window aggregation (SWAG). They have a wide range of applications including database analytics, operating systems, bank security and medical sensors. Existing challenges include the hardware complexity that comes with efficiently handling per-group states using hash-based approaches.

We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning ECG Representations via Poly-Window Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15225v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics 2025.

However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer</p></details> | 8 Pages |
| **[On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Charging Impact Analysis using Clustering Methods and Real-world Distribution Feeders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15092v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies - Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network reliability and reducing investment cost.</p></details> |  |

However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) 2025</p></details> |

However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applications of Medical AI (AMAI workshop) at MICCAI 2025 (submitted version)</p></details> |
| **[A Collusion-Resistance Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Operational Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14744v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control centers. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21 seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall, evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 4 figures.

Focusing on conditions observed over half tidal cycles, we observe that such data fall within the framework of functional extreme value theory, but violate standard assumptions due to temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior.a To address this, we propose a two-stage methodology. First, we introduce an autoregressive model to eliminate temporal dependence between cycles. Second, considering the model residuals, we adapt existing techniques based on Pareto processes. This allows us to build a simulator of extreme scenarios, by applying inverse transformations. These simulations depend on an initial time series, which can be randomly selected to tune the desired level of extremes. We validate the simulator performance by comparing simulated times series with observations, through several criteria, based on principal component analysis, extreme value analysis, and classification algorithms. The approach is applied to the surge data, on the G{\^a}vres site, located in southern Brittany, France.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pre-Trained Time Series Models for Electricity Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08113v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Multiscale Temporal Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14503v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organ-Agents: Virtual Human Physiology Simulator via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Autoregressive Switching Processes with Cumulative Shrinkage Priors for Graphical Modeling of Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03385v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible Bayesian approach for sparse Gaussian graphical modeling of multivariate time series. We account for temporal correlation in the data by assuming that observations are characterized by an underlying and unobserved hidden discrete autoregressive process. We assume multivariate Gaussian emission distributions and capture spatial dependencies by modeling the state-specific precision matrices via graphical horseshoe priors. We characterize the mixing probabilities of the hidden process via a cumulative shrinkage prior that accommodates zero-inflated parameters for non-active components, and further incorporate a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior to estimate the effective number of states from the data. For posterior inference, we develop a sampling procedure that allows estimation of the number of discrete autoregressive lags and the number of states, and that cleverly avoids having to deal with the changing dimensions of the parameter space. We thoroughly investigate performance of our proposed methodology through several simulation studies. We further illustrate the use of our approach for the estimation of dynamic brain connectivity based on fMRI data collected on a subject performing a task-based experiment on latent learning</p></details> |  |

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted by the 11th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |

Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |
| **[ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.</p></details> | conference |
| **[HRS: Hybrid Representation Framework with Scheduling Awareness for Time Series Forecasting in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12839v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conditionally specified graphical modeling of stationary multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13572v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models are ubiquitous for summarizing conditional relations in multivariate data. In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model ({\it CEStGM}). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12393v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02177v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework for the simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics. This will be done utilizing the monotone rearrangement and the nonparametric estimation. We capitalize the Gaussian approximation for the nonparametric monotone estimator and construct the asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) using designed bootstrap methods. We investigate two general and practical scenarios. The first is the simultaneous inference of monotone smooth trends from moderately high-dimensional time series. The proposed algorithm has been employed for the joint inference of temperature curves from multiple areas. Specifically, most existing methods are designed for a single monotone smooth trend. In such cases, our proposed SCB empirically exhibits the narrowest width among existing approaches while maintaining confidence levels. It has also been used for testing several hypotheses tailored to global warming. The second scenario involves simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying regression coefficients in time-varying coefficient linear models. The proposed algorithm has been utilized for testing the impact of sunshine duration on temperature which is believed to be increasing due to severe greenhouse effect. The validity of the proposed methods has been justified in theory as well as by extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyze multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyze a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighboring areas.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06627v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

| **[A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.</p></details> |  |

Efficient data engineering is critical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern data lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time ingestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support complex use cases.

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.</p></details> |  |

To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 110 tables.

However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Moreover, identification of a model corrupted with heavy-tailed, particularly infinite-variance noise, can be a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian- and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |

Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |

Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing</p></details> |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

A carefully chosen set of identification conditions for the common component and the potentially nonstationary main effects is proposed to strengthen the interpretations of sparse main effects, while estimators of all model components are presented. Sparse estimation of the latent main effects is proposed using a doubly adaptive fused lasso estimation to allow for sparse sub-block detection, with theoretical guarantees and rates of convergence spelt out for the final estimators. Sparse block consistency for the main effects is also proved as a result. A realized Mallow's $C_p$ is developed for tuning parameter selection, with practical implementation described. Simulation experiments are performed under a variety of settings, showing our proposed estimators work well. A set of NYC taxi traffic data is analyzed, clearly showing the effects of Covid-19 lockdown, with prolonged sparse main effects detected.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |

This potential is currently hampered by a lack of comprehensible benchmarks for multivariate time series anomaly detection, especially for the challenging case of satellite telemetry. The European Space Agency Benchmark for Anomaly Detection in Satellite Telemetry (ESA-ADB) aims to address this challenge and establish a new standard in the domain. It is a result of close cooperation between spacecraft operations engineers from the European Space Agency (ESA) and machine learning experts. The newly introduced ESA Anomalies Dataset contains annotated real-life telemetry from three different ESA missions, out of which two are included in ESA-ADB. Results of typical anomaly detection algorithms assessed in our novel hierarchical evaluation pipeline show that new approaches are necessary to address operators' needs.

They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Interpreting Time Series Forecasts with LIME and SHAP: A Case Study on the Air Passengers Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12253v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii) empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSpaformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medical time series (MedTS) classification is essential for effective clinical diagnosis, yet remains challenging due to complex multi-channel temporal dependencies, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics. These results highlight MedSpaformer's robustness and its potential as a unified solution for MedTS classification across diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 9 pages, 4 tables</p></details> |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Gaussian Processes with Latent Kronecker Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06895v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning 2025</p></details> |

Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series. This yields comprehensive general results that are applicable to various notions of dependence, which is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing series. Especially, we obtain the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions as known for the classical empirical process. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, uniform Lipschitz properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision, and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series forecasters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Wavelet-Based Framework for Mapping Long Memory in Resting-State fMRI: Age-Related Changes in the Hippocampus from the ADHD-200 Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11920v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are known to exhibit long-range temporal dependencies that challenge traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed methodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI and offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory and brain development.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSenCLIP: A Vision-Language Model for Remote Sensing Using Single-Pixel Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11919v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Global Dataset of Location Data Integrity-Assessed Reforestation Efforts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11349v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09630v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Air Quality PM2.5 Index Prediction Model Based on CNN-LSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11215v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However, due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11175v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01532v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical systems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor reconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.</p></details> |  |

Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy.

Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Investigation into Configuring Echo State Networks for Representative Benchmark Problem Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10887v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.</p></details> | 49 pages, 21 figures |

We adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens. Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of HDM given the advantages of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages. 5 figures.

| **[Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third, whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also based on standard definitions).</p></details> |  |
| **[From Basic Affordances to Symbolic Thought: A Computational Phylogenesis of Biological Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15082v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought, but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding, to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 47 pages 8 figures |
| **[Fast Symbolic Regression Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14481v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms. However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%. Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the effectiveness of reasoning and generalization. This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability. We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109 dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs. Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

The widespread adoption of VSAs has, in turn, spurred the development of numerous hardware solutions aimed at optimizing their performance. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive and unified discourse on the convergence of hardware and algorithms in the context of VSAs remains somewhat limited. The paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical software-level explorations and the development of efficient hardware architectures and emerging technology fabrics for VSAs, providing insights from the co-design aspect for researchers from either side. First, we introduce the principles of vector-symbolic computing, including its core mathematical operations and learning paradigms. Second, we provide an in-depth discussion on hardware technologies for VSAs, analyzing analog, mixed-signal, and digital circuit design styles. We compare hardware implementations of VSAs by carrying out detailed analysis of their performance characteristics and tradeoffs, allowing us to extract design guidelines for the development of arbitrary VSA formulations. Third, we discuss a methodology for cross-layer design of VSAs that identifies synergies across layers and explores key ingredients for hardware/software co-design of VSAs. Finally, as a concrete demonstration of this methodology, we propose the first in-memory computing hierarchical cognition hardware system, showcasing the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of this co-design approach. The paper concludes with a discussion of open research challenges for future explorations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zobrist Hash-based Duplicate Detection in Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13859v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\% speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy based on cached information.</p></details> |  |

Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.

Unlike conventional reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components, our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals, processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for robust and interpretable reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |
| **[SymMatika: Structure-Aware Symbolic Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03110v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates on the Nguyen and Feynman benchmark suites, an impressive recovery rate of 61\% on Nguyen-12 compared to the next best 2\%, and strong placement on the error-complexity Pareto fronts on the Feynman equations and on a subset of 57 SRBench Black-box problems. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning remains a core challenge for language models (LMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we focus on synthesis of single-invocation recursion-free functions conforming to a specification given as a logical formula in the presence of uncomputable symbols (i.e., symbols used in the specification but not allowed in the resulting function). We approach the problem via SMT-solving methods: we present a quantifier elimination algorithm using model-based projections for both total and partial function synthesis, working with theories of uninterpreted functions and linear arithmetic and their combination. For this purpose we also extend model-based projection to produce witnesses for these theories. Further, we present procedures tailored for the case of uniquely determined solutions.

The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process. By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks -- ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe Autonomous Driving Policies using a Neuro-Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01316v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logic (DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and symbolic first-order logic (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in a highway driving scenario using the HighD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and exhibits better generalizability to new highway driving scenarios compared to traditional DRL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

Although traditional rule-based architectures offer robust structured reasoning for drone autonomy, their capabilities fall short in dynamically complex operational environments that require adaptive symbolic planning. Symbolic RL (SRL), using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), explicitly integrates domain-specific knowledge and operational constraints, significantly improving the reliability and safety of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) decision making. In this study, we propose the AMAD-SRL framework, an extended and refined version of the Autonomous Mission Agents for Drones (AMAD) cognitive multi-agent architecture, enhanced with symbolic reinforcement learning for dynamic mission planning and execution. We validated our framework in a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) environment structured identically to an intended Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) platform, ensuring seamless transition to real hardware. Experimental results demonstrate stable integration and interoperability of modules, successful transitions between BDI-driven and symbolic RL-driven planning phases, and consistent mission performance. Specifically, we evaluate a target acquisition scenario in which the UAV plans a surveillance path followed by a dynamic reentry path to secure the target while avoiding threat zones. In this SIL evaluation, mission efficiency improved by approximately 75% over a coverage-based baseline, measured by travel distance reduction. This study establishes a robust foundation for handling complex UAV missions and discusses directions for further enhancement and validation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based number tasks using a variety of methods to understand how well we can interpret them through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs) -- precise programs describable by rules and typed, mutable variables. We use autoregressive GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained on tasks where the correct tokens depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret raw NN activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the activity in terms of neural subspaces rather than individual neurons. Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), we find that, depending on network architecture, dimensionality, and task specifications, alignments with SA's can be very high, or they can be only approximate, or fail altogether. We extend our analytic toolkit to address the failure cases by expanding the DAS framework to a broader class of alignment functions that more flexibly capture NN activity in terms of interpretable variables from SAs, and we provide theoretic and empirical explorations of Linear Alignment Functions (LAFs) in contrast to the preexisting Orthogonal Alignment Functions (OAFs). Through analyses of specific cases we confirm the usefulness of causal interventions on neural subspaces for NN interpretability, and we show that recurrent models can develop graded, symbol-like number variables in their neural activity. We further show that shallow Transformers learn very different solutions than recurrent networks, and we prove that such models must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that do not rely on cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers.</p></details> |  |

Such delays might lead to unnatural or frustrating interactions. In this paper, we investigate filler types to mitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of the agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate with ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the delays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and gestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic indicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other one external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the behavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of presence, humanlikeness, and naturalness. Participants looked away from the face more often when symbolic indicators were displayed, but the visualizations did not lead to a more positive impression of the agent or to increased presence. The majority of participants preferred the behavioral fillers, only 12.5% and 4.2% favored the symbolic embedded and external conditions, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |

In this paper, we describe how real digital dictionaries can be embedded into AMR directed graphs (digraphs), using state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models. Then, we reduce those graphs in a confluent manner, i.e. with transformations that preserve their circuit space. Finally, the properties of these reduces digraphs are analyzed and discussed in relation to the symbol grounding problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point or Line? Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23395v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finetuning Large Language Model as an Effective Symbolic Regressor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09897v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treating complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises 148,102 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference. Further, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish SymbolicChat, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental results validate SymbolicChat as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 8.37% in form-level consistency score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Aware Ensemble SINDy for Interpretable Symbolic SGS Closure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14085v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries; memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model identification. Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} = 0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$, corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data without prior theoretical assumptions. The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[How Does a Virtual Agent Decide Where to Look? -- Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning for Embodied Head Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08930v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema, and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while retaining behavioral plausibility.</p></details> |  |

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for consideration of publication in May</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic Quantile Regression for the Interpretable Prediction of Conditional Quantiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08080v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable. Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting feature influences at varying quantiles.</p></details> |  |

These problems often involve high-level task specifications, such as temporal logic or chance constraints, which require solving large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing MILP-based planning methods suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, hindering their real-time applicability. We propose to use a neuro-symbolic approach to accelerate MILP-based motion planning by leveraging machine learning techniques to guide the solver's symbolic search. Focusing on two representative classes of planning problems, namely, those with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and those with chance constraints formulated via Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP). We demonstrate how graph neural network-based learning methods can guide traditional symbolic MILP solvers in solving challenging planning problems, including branching variable selection and solver parameter configuration. Through extensive experiments, we show that neuro-symbolic search techniques yield scalability gains. Our approach yields substantial improvements, achieving an average performance gain of about 20% over state-of-the-art solver across key metrics, including runtime and solution quality.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Evaluation and Selection of Unsupervised Pretext Tasks from a Neuro-Symbolic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07299v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning (SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model, knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation method.</p></details> |  |

Path explosion, where the number of states to track becomes unwieldy, is one of the biggest challenges hindering symbolic execution's practical application. To combat this, researchers have employed various strategies to enable symbolic execution on complex software systems. This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of these strategies, categorizing them into two primary approaches: Scope Reduction, which aims to reduce the scope of symbolic execution to manageable portions of code, and Guidance Heuristics, which steer the symbolic execution engine toward promising paths. Using this taxonomy as a lens, we survey applications of symbolic executions in several domains such as vulnerability analysis, malware analysis, firmware re-hosting, and network protocol analysis. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including the application of symbolic execution to real-time operating systems and modern, type-safe languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: A...</summary><p>v2: Adds a subsection to Future Directions discussing the role of LLMs in symbolic execution</p></details> |

The recursive regeneration of symbolic structures introduces structured variations in latent embeddings, leading to controlled shifts in attention dynamics and lexical diversity across sequential generations. A comparative analysis with conventional fine-tuning techniques reveals that structural modifications at the symbolic level induce distinct variations in contextual sensitivity while maintaining overall model fluency and coherence. Shifts in attention weight distributions highlight the role of symbolic modifications in adjusting token dependencies, influencing response variability, and refining long-form text generation. Experimental findings suggest that symbolic perturbations can enhance adaptability in domain-specific applications, allowing modifications in model behavior without retraining. Evaluations of semantic drift indicate that recursive regeneration alters long-range token dependencies, affecting topic coherence across extended text sequences. Results from lexical variability assessments further support the conclusion that symbolic-level modifications introduce interpretable variations in generated responses, potentially enabling more controlled stylistic adjustments in automated text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Not all methods will succeed for a given problem, and when several do, the results, though mathematically equivalent, can differ greatly in presentation complexity. Traditionally, this choice has been made with minimal consideration of the problem instance, leading to inefficiencies. We present a machine learning (ML) approach using tree-based deep learning models within a two-stage architecture: first identifying applicable methods for a given instance, then ranking them by predicted output complexity. Furthermore, we find representing mathematical expressions as tree structures significantly improves performance over sequence-based representations, and our two-stage framework outperforms alternative ML formulations. Using a diverse dataset generated by six distinct data generators, our models achieve nearly 90% accuracy in selecting the optimal method on a 70,000 example holdout test set. On an independent out-of-distribution benchmark from Maple's internal test suite, our tree transformer model maintains strong generalisation, outperforming Maple's built-in selector and prior ML approaches. These results highlight the critical role of data representation and problem framing in ML for symbolic computation, and we expect our methodology to generalise effectively to similar optimisation problems in mathematical software.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, submitted to Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Meta-SR: In-Context Learning for Evolving Selection Operators in Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18602v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a meta learning framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: a lack of semantic guidance and code bloat. The absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, and bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator and bloat control. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the evolved operator can further improve the state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithm, achieving the best performance among 26 symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms across 116 regression datasets. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for research on the symbolic basis of human thought.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs. The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Inputs for Grammar Mining using Dynamic Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03832v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process structured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid, this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First, the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature. Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01', `10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8469 etc.). Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression, which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information processing.</p></details> | 4 figures, 3 tables |
| **[Metasurface-Enabled Superheterodyne Transmitter for Arbitrary-Order Modulation with Spatially Isotropic Symbol Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01863v4)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetically programmable information metasurfaces, as dynamically controllable 2D metamaterials, hold significant promise as low-profile hardware enabling passive wave control and signal generation for backscatter systems. However, current metasurface-based transmitters architecture fundamentally suffer from hardware non-modularization, forcing all transmitter functions onto nonlinear switch-based unit cells, which introduces symbol mapping inconsistency via phase coupling. Moreover, both temporal coding (limited by unit cell diodes) and space-time coding (impaired by symbol anisotropy) exhibit irreducible harmonic interference and entangled control of amplitude, phase, and beam direction. This paper proposes a metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA), comprising a digital up-conversion (DUC) module performing baseband-to-intermediate frequency (IF) conversion, filtering, and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and a reconfigurable metasurface featuring programmable unit cells that independently control both the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient. Systematically, the architecture leverages a dual-stage up-conversion process, typical of superheterodyne systems, but uniquely employs the metasurface for the final RF conversion stage. Building upon this framework, a proof-of-concept prototype featuring a 5.8 GHz magnitude-phase decoupled (MPD) metasurface (<15 degree phase deviation per state) and a DAC-based DUC module is presented. Extensive validation confirms the metasurface's capability for distortion-free mixing with arbitrary IF signals while maintaining consistent radiation patterns. The prototype successfully implements diverse QAM modulation schemes (4QAM to 256QAM) in mono-static and bi-static configurations, demonstrating symbol isotropy for spatially separated receivers and achieving a data rate of approximately 20 Mbps (at 5 MHz IF)...</p></details> |  |
| **[CloudAnoAgent: Anomaly Detection for Cloud Sites via LLM Agent with Neuro-Symbolic Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01844v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Finite-State Symbolic Automaton Model for the Collatz Map and Its Convergence Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21728v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a finite-state, deterministic automaton that emulates the Collatz function through digitwise transitions on base-10 representations. Each digit is represented as a symbolic triplet (r, p, c) encoding its value, the parity of the next digit, and an incoming carry propagated from the lower digit. This yields exactly 60 possible local states. The automaton applies local, parity-aware rules that collectively reconstruct the global arithmetic of the Collatz map. We show that all symbolic trajectories converge in finitely many steps to a unique terminal cycle (4, 0, 0) -> (2, 0, 0) -> (1, 0, 0), with all higher digit positions degenerating to the absorbing state (0, 0, 0). This collapse reveals a canonical symbolic normal form of Collatz dynamics. In parallel, a binary view explains the dynamics as alternating bit-length growth and contraction, aligning with known heuristics for Collatz convergence. This structural perspective is further reinforced by a symbolic drift function and a ranking potential that together explain and formalize the convergence process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Updated automaton diagrams, outlining support for affine maps T(n) = an + b, and a new section on binary symbolic drift explaining convergence.

| **[A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.</p></details> | version 3 |

We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation. Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its superiority across multiple subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.</p></details> |  |

While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research initiatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>The X...</summary><p>The XAI Challenge @ TRNS-AI Workshop, IJCNN 2025: Explainable AI for Educational Question Answering.

This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desyan: A Platform for Seamless Value-Flow and Symbolic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00508v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, two different types of static analyses have emerged as dominant paradigms both in academia and industry: value-flow analysis (e.g., data-flow analysis or points-to analysis) and symbolic analysis (e.g., symbolic execution). Despite their individual successes in numerous application fields, the two approaches have remained largely separate; an artifact of the simple reality that there is no broadly adopted unifying platform for effortless and efficient integration of symbolic techniques with high-performance data-flow reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce Desyan: a platform for writing program analyses with seamless integration of value-flow and symbolic reasoning. Desyan expands a production-ready Datalog fixpoint engine (Souffl\'e) with full-fledged SMT solving invoking industry-leading SMT engines. Desyan provides constructs for automatically (and efficiently!) handling typical patterns that come up in program analysis. At the same time, the integration is agnostic with respect to the solving technology, and supports Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, via a bottom-up algebraic reasoning module. The result is an engine that allows blending different kinds of reasoning, as needed for the underlying analysis. For value-flow analysis, the engine is the best-in-class Datalog evaluator (often by a factor of over 20x in execution time); for applications that require full SMT (e.g., a concolic execution engine or other symbolic evaluator that needs to solve arbitrarily complex conditions), the engine is leveraging the leading SMT solvers; for lightweight symbolic evaluation (e.g., solving simple conditionals in the context of a path-sensitive analysis), the engine can use Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, achieving large speedups (often of over 2x) compared to eagerly appealing to an SMT solver.</p></details> |  |

However, this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the ``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.</p></details> |  |

We built a neural-symbolic system, called FGeo-HyperGNet, to automatically perform human-like geometric problem solving. The symbolic component is a formal system built on FormalGeo, which can automatically perform geometric relational reasoning and algebraic calculations and organize the solution into a hypergraph with conditions as hypernodes and theorems as hyperedges. The neural component, called HyperGNet, is a hypergraph neural network based on the attention mechanism, including an encoder to encode the structural and semantic information of the hypergraph and a theorem predictor to provide guidance in solving problems. The neural component predicts theorems according to the hypergraph, and the symbolic component applies theorems and updates the hypergraph, thus forming a predict-apply cycle to ultimately achieve readable and traceable automatic solving of geometric problems. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural-symbolic architecture. We achieved state-of-the-art results with a TPA of 93.50% and a PSSR of 88.36% on the FormalGeo7K dataset.

| **[AutoCodeSherpa: Symbolic Explanations in AI Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22414v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously use external tools on top of one or more LLMs to accomplish specific tasks. Lately LLM agents for software engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used SonarQube static analyzer. Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment, agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as Agentless to improve their output.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Probabilistic Reasoning on Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21873v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

Typically, in the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete. In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p></details> | long paper |

In particular, neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences, without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods, boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional architectures that rely on convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients. Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled, interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures for learning on graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, most approaches rely on transformer-based architectures with self-attention mechanisms, which are constrained by quadratic computational complexity, limiting scalability for long sequences. To address this, we propose Symbolic Music Diffusion with Mamba (SMDIM), a novel diffusion-based architecture integrating Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient global context modeling and the Mamba-FeedForward-Attention Block (MFA) for precise local detail preservation. The MFA Block combines the linear complexity of Mamba layers, the non-linear refinement of FeedForward layers, and the fine-grained precision of self-attention mechanisms, achieving a balance between scalability and musical expressiveness. SMDIM achieves near-linear complexity, making it highly efficient for long-sequence tasks. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including FolkDB, a collection of traditional Chinese folk music that represents an underexplored domain in symbolic music generation, SMDIM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Beyond symbolic music, SMDIM's architectural design demonstrates adaptability to a broad range of long-sequence generation tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for coherent sequence modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages,3figures |

The key insight is to leverage an LLM to automatically generate vulnerability patterns and translate them into detection queries. Specifically, MoCQ incorporates an iterative loop in which an LLM refines queries based on carefully designed feedback information. The resulting queries are then executed to analyze large codebases and detect vulnerabilities. We evaluated MoCQ on 12 vulnerability types across four programming languages. MoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-developed queries, with significantly less expert time needed. MoCQ also uncovered 46 new vulnerability patterns that experts missed, each representing an overlooked vulnerability class. MoCQ further discovered seven previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself. We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router, a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 31 figures.

In this work, we develop an Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale across diverse software offerings internally. Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes. Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator, the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness (neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of 42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations. Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated fixes). Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good starting point.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |

Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space. Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as "black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems, requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible, adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise, interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |

| **[Fast Task Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15975v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few "important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.</p></details> |  |

However, its nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.</p></details> |  |

It aims to enable users to drive generative software development using only natural language requirements. However, since end-users often lack knowledge of software engineering, their requirement descriptions are frequently ambiguous, raising significant challenges to generative software development. Although existing approaches utilize structured languages like Gherkin to clarify user narratives, they still struggle to express the causal logic between preconditions and behavior actions. This paper introduces RequireCEG, a requirement elicitation and self-review agent that embeds causal-effect graphs (CEGs) in a neuro-symbolic collaboration architecture. RequireCEG first uses a feature tree to analyze user narratives hierarchically, clearly defining the scope of software components and their system behavior requirements. Next, it constructs the self-healing CEGs based on the elicited requirements, capturing the causal relationships between atomic preconditions and behavioral actions. Finally, the constructed CEGs are used to review and optimize Gherkin scenarios, ensuring consistency between the generated Gherkin requirements and the system behavior requirements elicited from user narratives. To evaluate our method, we created the RGPair benchmark dataset and conducted extensive experiments. It achieves an 87% coverage rate and raises diversity by 51.88%.</p></details> |  |

Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.</p></details> |  |

However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures; Invited review for the Royal Society Philosophical Transactions A special issue "Symbolic regression in the physical sciences"</p></details> |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate Boolformer on a broad set of real-world binary classification datasets, demonstrating its potential as an interpretable alternative to classic machine learning methods. Finally, we apply it to the widespread task of modeling the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and show through a benchmark that Boolformer is competitive with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude.

While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Given a discrete-time control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins. We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform (state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

Additionally, symbolic anchors such as photos or personalized content may serve as memory cues to reinforce digital engagement. This study explores how these mechanisms support technology use in dementia care within the South Korean context. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 11 professional caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with cognitive decline. Grounded theory methods guided the analysis, using iterative coding and constant comparison to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that familiar digital routines (e.g., taking photos) persisted through procedural memory. Symbolic anchors such as family photos or recognizable icons enhanced interaction and emotional engagement. However, unfamiliar or anthropomorphic technologies often triggered fear or symbolic resistance. DISCUSSION: Findings highlight the dual role of procedural memory and symbolic anchors in sustaining digital engagement. Designing culturally responsive and cognitively accessible technologies may enhance autonomy and well-being in dementia care.

In this work, we investigate their capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity. Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification, outperforming Mathematica in various cases.</p></details> |  |

However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving, static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis, demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers tight probability bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at OOPSLA 2025 (R2)</p></details> |
| **[Deliberate Reasoning in Language Models as Structure-Aware Planning with an Accurate World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03136v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.</p></details> | ACL25 (main) |

However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4VV: Evaluating Cutting-Edge LLMs for Generation and Evaluation of Directive-Based Parallel Programming Model Compiler Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet. Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling (PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with state-of-the-art autoregressive models.

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore, EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted problems.

| **[From Intent to Execution: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reinforcement Learning for Precise CAD Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10118v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book), containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus, and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-4B models.</p></details> |  |
